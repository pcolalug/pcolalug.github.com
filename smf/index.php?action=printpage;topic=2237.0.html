					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, now that it's so cheap, I'm thinking I'm going to go over to the BX today and grab UT2004. &nbsp;I felt pretty jilted by 2003 but heard 2004 fixed that and figured, &quot;Eh, what the hell, I need a reason to run some games on Linux native,&quot; and heard UT2004 had good Linux support.<br /><br />Anyway, if anyone plays, you can hit me up on AIM or in here, it'd be fun to play. &nbsp;It'll take me a few games to get my bearings but I definitely wasn't bad in UT, Q3A, or many other FPSes.<br /><br /><i>I'd get Enemy Territory but...well...to be honest, the WWII setting just doesn't interest me anymore. &nbsp;I guess I could say it never interested me. &nbsp;Oh well.</i><br /><br />Update: &nbsp;just read some more, didn't know ET was free. &nbsp;I suppose it wouldn't hurt to fill up a little hard drive space since it's free.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you'll look back through this forum, you'll see that UT2004 has been played/discussed quite a bit... &nbsp;If you didn't like UT2003, you may not want to bother anyway, as they are very similar. &nbsp;The only difference I can recall is one added gameplay mode (Onslaught) in UT2004, which is actually the best mode in my opinion...<br /><br />Personally, I don't play it much any more, as it just kind of got repetitive and boring, and online cheating is so rampant that it takes the fun out of it. &nbsp;Several of us in here play ET pretty regularly, stop in to the IRC channel (#pcolalug on irc.freenode.net) to see when we're playing, if you're interested.<br /><br />Dan</div>
