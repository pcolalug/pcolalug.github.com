					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Not completely sure if this is brand-new info..., but seems that Sun has made Solaris 9 (for x86) a free download. &nbsp;Might be checking this out.<br /><br />Story here: &nbsp;http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/61/34450.html<br /><br />Download here: &nbsp;http://wwws.sun.com/software/solaris/binaries/get.html<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">My only problem with solaris x86 is that driver support is bad. &nbsp;Most hardware drivers are available, just not bundled with it, and usually not free. &nbsp;As an example, most wireless cards are supported, but the drivers are $100 from a company out of Ft. Walton. &nbsp;Same for a lot of video drivers, but most people can just use the vesa driver, as long as you don't need accelerated 3D video.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">when i tried solaris 9 x86, for the most part it supported my p2 based celeron 300 system that i was using as a test system....network and everything came up and worked, video with the vesa drivers worked for the nvidia vanta 16mb pci.... i wasnt too impressed with it straight out with some of the support but was an interesting experience to say the least<br /><br />i wasnt really fond of the desktop and all but i was reading that they were going to put out a java desktop system based on solaris if im not mistaken. If they do put out that version and possibly get better with some of the support like video and sound and all, i might have to give solaris another try &nbsp;:D</div>
