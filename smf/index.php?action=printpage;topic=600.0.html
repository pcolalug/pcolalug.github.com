					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm downloading 9.0 right now, from one of the mirrors listed on the Redhat site. &nbsp;Speed is not the greatest because lots of people are downloading it, but it's coming along. &nbsp;If you've got broadband access, that's the easiest way to get it...<br />Dan</div>
