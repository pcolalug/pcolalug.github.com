					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm in the process of downloading 3-disks from the mandriva site to install onto my laptop. My laptop has Fedora Core on it now (but I haven't got the slightest clue on how to use it). I put the first CD in for Mandriva to see if it would come up and the CD drive runs but nothing starts. Could anyone tell me how to get the CD to boot up either when I first turn the computer on or give me steps on how to enter commands for Fedora to read that drive in order to install these CDs. I really appreciate your time and help. Thanks! &nbsp;:wink:</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Was there a distro that had a bad batch of images go out that wouldn't boot on some drives? That wasn't Mandriva was it?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I seem to remember that there was such a thing for Mandrake, but what I am remembering has been a couple of years ago.<br /><br />I think the &quot;Boot from CD&quot; option in the setup menu will take care of it for her.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you have a dvd drive on your computer, I have a copy of mandriva 2005 Limited Edition you could have.<br /><br />In any case, I live right off campus. &nbsp;If you need help with the install or anything else let me know. <br /><br />brent dot holland at gmail dot com.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Allison, another thing to be aware of is the difference between creating a bootable CD versus a regular data or music disk. &nbsp;Look for an option in your CD Burner software to create an &quot;ISO&quot; CD. &nbsp;Some software for burning CD's doesn't include this option (my software didn't). &nbsp;There is some free software called &quot;BURNCDCC&quot; which is specifically designed for creating bootable CD's.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this is the problem you're having, but it sounds like the same problem I experienced when I first tried to create a bootable CD. &nbsp;Anyway, you can try some of the posted suggestions, or post a reply asking someone for copies of the CD's.<br /><br />Sorry you're having to deal with these extra hassles. &nbsp;Good luck.<br /><br />dennis</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks guys for the replies. I figured out what my problem was last night. I wasn't creating a bootable CD however I have another problem. After creating a bootable CD with the Mandrake download, I can't get it to boot up when I turn my computer on. I've tried just about every button on my keyboard when it immediately is turned on and it continues to go straight to the Fedora boot-up. It's driving me crazy! Does anyone have or know anything about why my Toshiba Satellite (5501-S501) laptop chooses not to go into any kind of system menu thing?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">What I have found is that you hold &quot;Esc&quot; while powering on. That will get you to something where you may have to press F1 to get into the menu, or it will take you to the menu directly.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello and welcome to the Group.<br />To answer your question My Toshiba it's the F12 key when you see the initial red Toshiba screen when you turn your computer on. It will give you a boot option menu.....Hope this helps.</div>
