					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Nominations are now open for the 2009/2010 Steering Committee. Currently your steering committee consists of:<br />President -- dpeach<br />Vice President -- yossarian<br />Secretary -- green_dragon37<br />Librarian -- lloydr<br />Web Master -- lloydr (by default, but another could be elected with lloydr maintaining hardware control)<br /><br />According to the by-laws the election should have been held at the September meeting. Lack of planning on my part. Sorry.<br /><br />Please read the by-laws section of the forums that deal with the Steering Committee so that you can see what the responsibilities of the committee are. You can certainly nominate yourself.<br /><br />You can nominate people to several positions. You can nominate just one person to a particular position if you don&#039;t have suggestions for all positions. Just list forum name and position.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Presently I do not have the time for such an endeavor, And sadly I feel that we may have reached the end of this. With the lack of turn-out this last 2 years I feel that it is not beneficial to the group to keep drudging along like we have. I would suggest that we keep the forums running and try to generate interest in maybe having a quarterly meeting to have more to discuss.<br />The reason I feel like this is 2 part. 1 As Linux has grown in a whole more information has become available to the newbie via Google and such to help figure out things faster than meeting people that you do not know.<br />Geeks in general are not social creatures.... :) 2. With the advent of Distros like ubuntu and the likes they have made it almost goof proof to do a Linux Install.<br /><br />Just my thoughts.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am not against a quarterly meeting.<br /><br />I still think we need basic officers though. We need to talk about a restructuring of positions if we want to go this route and make our group stronger through the on-line presence as opposed to the off-line one.<br /><br />Let me discuss with the steering committee some ideas I have before I put something out that sounds like a mandate from the president. I don&#039;t want to force any ideas that has not been cleared with others first.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">So far we have nominations for Yossarian, Green_dragon and Lloydr for controlling positions.<br /><br />We need to lay down a date for termination of nominations and then start the voting if we want to do this over the forums.<br /><br />I propose the nominations need to be done by midnight Friday October 23. Then votes can be cast from that time until midnight Monday October 26. This will allow the weekend crowd a chance to vote and those who only get on the forums from work can vote on Monday.<br /><br />Can we get someone to second the motion?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok, we will continue the nominations in this thread until midnight Friday night.<br /><br />Mr. Secretary, can you please start a thread on Friday night/Saturday morning with a list of the nominations that will officially start the voting. (I will be on the road traveling and will probably totally forget).</div>
