					Title: <b>KDE or Gnome</b><br />
					Post by: <b>woodyharold</b> on <b>November 20, 2007, 08:42:07 pm</b>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">&nbsp; &nbsp; My first linux install was Caldera 1.0 ( Caldera later morphed to SCO ) that included both KDE and Gnome. Switching between the two was a main menu item. After using both for a few days, I decided I was more comfortable with KDE from the start and have never used Gnome since, that is until this past week. At our November meeting a couple of our young members were extolling the virtues of Gnome and instead of dismissing them for being ignorant, young, and inexperienced, I decided to try Gnome. I loaded Gnome Desktop into my kubuntu gutsy distro and was most pleasantly surprised to find most of my distaste for Gnome had faded away, in fact with a little more use, I may get to where I like using it. Right now it doesn&#039;t seem to me there is much difference between the learning curve and usability of either KDE or Gnome.I would like to receive inputs on the pros and cons of each Window manager and why I should use one instead of the other.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Harold</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I too have been a KDE fan since I started using Linux quite some time back. There are things I like about both desktops and things I dislike about both. My most recent experiences with Gnome have resulted in me not hating it as much. I have always told people that they should try both, but I encouraged them that KDE would be better since I know it better and could help them out if they needed help setting things up. More recently though, I have just told them to try both and decide. As much as I did not like Gnome before, I think they are both good desktops now and think it just comes down to personal opinion.<br /><br />I dislike the file manager in both. Konqueror leaves a lot to be desired. Nautilus too. What would make them perfect? I am not sure what I want in a file manager, but I have not seen it yet. My experiences with KDE/Gnome/OS X/Windows have not yielded the perfect product. Though I think that Windows 98 had it more right than most others.<br /><br />My biggest beef with Gnome is (except in Ubuntu) if you click on the space between the text and an icon, you click on nothing. I think the text and the icon should be tied as one unit and any white space between them should be part of that unit. I am not sure why this bothers me so much, but it seems that I click on that white space often. Ubuntu fixed this in their release of Gnome. Oddly enough, Mac OS X has the exact same problem. It really irritates me for some reason. Nautilus is very Mac OS X like. It seems that what bothers me in one platform bothers me in the other.<br /><br />KDE is a bit clunkier to configure. Konqueror is bloated. It is a horrible browser. They should kill the browser part of it and make it just a file manager. Kubuntu has a STUPID file manager named Dolphin or something like that. It is all big and bubbly taking up all the screen real estate to show you 3 icons in the file manager. I am sure it can be changed, but I hate it when a program comes pre-configured stupidly (another beef about Gnome). Though a bit harder to get set up the way I want, I find KDE needs less out of the box tinkering. That could just be that I have used KDE long enough that I know how it thinks.<br /><br />Those are my thoughts. I guess I have not made a strong argument for either one. I think now, more than ever, they are both very good and it really just comes down to personal preference.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I actually prefer the command line or blackbox for most machines but I have KDE loaded as it is the stock Slackware windows manger. I even use Dillo for my webbrowsing and file manging.....As for Konqueror it is immensily configurable and takes a little work to get it where you want it and you can disable the browser part...google has the answer. I like to keep a terminal window open in the bottom of it when I am using it. As for Gnome I have used it to but have found now that both gnome and kde are so&nbsp; &nbsp;similiar that there is no need to flip back and fourth.<br /><br />Just my thoughts</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m a huge fan of Gnome because I like simplicity. KDE and Gnome both have the ability to be changed greatly, however, I want to be able to find mundane things quickly. For instance the KDE menu has about 15 different things to choose from to get to a sub menu; Gnome has like 5 default ones. Plus they are ordered better. For instance is the wifi connector internet or utilities?<br /><br />WARNING: OPINION:<br />The people that like KDE like to edit the config file because they cant find it on their menu. (Thats a joke, don&#039;t cruicify me.) The people that use Gnome like the nice gui experience of X.<br /><br />I also like the single layered panel. In KDE I almost feel like I should hide it somewhere so the big thing is out of my way. I feel comfortable keeping the gnome panel there at all times. <br /><br />I do not have much need for the file browser because anything complex I want to do I do in the terminal. They both fulfill my basic wish&#039;s, so no complaints. <br /><br />I feel like Gnome is closer to Windows, so it is easier for me to switch between the two and it is easier for me to show people the differences between the two OS&#039;s. <br /><br />I would agree that KDE has more options with transparancy but other than that I have never seen a reason to confuse myself with it. I can run KDE apps on my gnome computer just fine.<br /><br />PS: I started my linux journey on KDE with Knoppix, so I am familiar with it (at least whatever version 5.1 was using.) It probobly would have helped if all the programs were in English instead of German.</div>
