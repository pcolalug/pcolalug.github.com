					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Glad to see that there is a LUG here in the Pensacola &quot;Bay Area&quot; ;-). Just moved back home from a 5 years in ATL and 4 years in SFO after graduating from UWF. Look forward to some informative and productive events. PS By the way, this isn't a slam or anything, but does the club have access to some more modern venues, like the .NET camp has? I haven't seen faux wood paneling like that since my parents converted our garage/playroom in the 70's!<br /><br />Warmest regards, :lol: &nbsp;<br /><br />cyberonin2001</div>

The restaraunt where we meet has been around Pensacola since the early 50s and has some pretty good food. They also have a pretty decent room for no cost to hold our meetings.<br /><br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">First, welcome! <br /><br />As for the venue, Oscar's has been good to us so far and I think the food's good. We originally met at the BAM on Davis, but they up and remodled our space away. If you have sugguestions for a meeting place, we'd be glad to hear 'em. Keep in mind, though that, as steve said, we don't charge dues (don't ever plan to, either), so we can't use any space that we have to pay for. <br /><br />I think that .Net groups charge dues (is *anything* concerning Microsoft free?) and was started/is supported by UWF's business department as well as IT Gulfcoast. We got each other, a willingness to learn, and free and unfettered access to some of the best software, tools, and technology ever created!</div>
