					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Maybe this should have been in he newbie section but.............<br /><br />I installed SuSE 9.1 on my laptop today but I couldn't get it to install on a 12GB partition on my laptop hard drive while my USB hard drive was connected. &nbsp;When the USB drive was connected during installation, SuSE wanted to install itself there instead of on the lapptop HD.<br /><br />Since I had to turn off the USB HD during install, now that I run Linux, my USB HD (sda) does not appear to automount. &nbsp;If I go into YAST, it shows up on the hardware scan though.<br /><br />Running the &quot;mount&quot;command in the terminal gives the following output:<br /><br />pete@linux:~&gt; mount<br />/dev/hda3 on / type reiserfs (rw,acl,user_xattr)<br />proc on /proc type proc (rw)<br />tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw)<br />devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,mode=0620,gid=5)<br />/dev/hda1 on /windows/C type ntfs (ro,noexec,nosuid,nodev,gid=100,umask=0002,nls=utf8)<br />/dev/hdc on /media/cdrecorder type subfs (ro,nosuid,nodev,fs=cdfss,procuid,iocharset=utf8)<br />usbfs on /proc/bus/usb type usbfs (rw)<br />/dev/sda2 on /media/usb-storage-703009F41BCD:0:0:0p2 type subfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,sync,procuid,iocharset=utf8)<br />/dev/sda3 on /media/usb-storage-703009F41BCD:0:0:0p3 type subfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,sync,procuid,iocharset=utf8)<br />/dev/sda1 on /media/usb-storage-703009F41BCD:0:0:0p1 type subfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,sync,procuid,iocharset=utf8)<br /><br />My question is how do I mount the USB drive and get SuSE to go ahead and mount the drive at boot up? &nbsp;I had set up a 25GB Reiser partition on it before I tried to install SuSE but now it looks like there are three partitions on the drive.<br /><br />Sorry to be so clueless and thanks for your help.<br /><br />Blessings,<br /><br />Pete</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Can you run this command and paste it here please.<br />df -h /dev/sda<br />this should give us a better list of what the partition setup is on the usbhd<br />as to mount create a directory under where your other mounted items are listed like cdrecorder and floppy then mkdir usbhd then type mount -t auto /dev/sda/ mnt/usbhd you should be able to cd to usbhd and have access to it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Unplug then plug-in your USB drive, and using konqueror browse to /media/ folder and look in the usb-storage-* folders, see if you can find where it mounted it. &nbsp;(If it mounted it).<br /><br />At least on Gnome in the older versions of SuSE you didn't get a drive icon on the desktop when mounting something like a USB drive, not sure about that version or KDE though.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I spoke too soon...<br /><br />I need to change the file permissions for everything in that partition. &nbsp;Reading in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Linux in a Nutshell</span> I see a command CHMOD that might do the trick.<br /><br />Is it possible to log in as root, go the root directory of the partition and do something like<br /><br /><b>chmod -R 777</b><br /><br />and, with one magic bullet, remove the owner restrictions from all the subdirectories and files on the partiton?</div>
