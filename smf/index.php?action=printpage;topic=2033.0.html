					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/<br /><br />I was poking around for how to backup DVDs in Linux with the existing software and came across the utility transcode which seems all well and good for ripping, transcoding, and reencoding for preparation for burning with K3B (assuming I'm understanding it right) but apparently being a &quot;swiss-army knife&quot; has the drawback that it's unwieldy to use.<br /><br />For this the front-end DVD::Rip was created and looked like a solid piece of software...and also the only solution I could find. &nbsp;The issue with it is that it has a LOT of requirements in terms of software and while I've beaten down nearly every one of them I'm stuck on one final bit of the software prep that keeps it from running. &nbsp;<br /><br />DVD::Rip is perl-based and apparently needs some modules for perl, the &quot;Gtk&quot; module specifically. &nbsp;I've tried to follow their directions for making the gtk module (complete with the --no-guessing bit) and installing it as well as separately making the Pixbuf part but both have failed miserably after following their directions to a &quot;t.&quot;<br /><br />Without these making the &quot;makefile&quot; for DVD::Rip fails horribly so apparently these are seriously required. &nbsp;There's also no Slackware packages so I can't have that ease of installation.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I can post more specifics at home, but any thought/opinions on this? &nbsp;Should I just look for another program? &nbsp;I'm not really aware of any others that are used for DVD backup in Linux and while I &quot;can&quot; do it in Windows I'd really like to spend that time in Linux if at all possible.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I decided with the system screw described in another section that I'd just give up on this for now as fixing perl is a little beyond me (I wouldn't know where to start, really) and nobody else apparently has an issue with this. &nbsp;Suppose I'll just have to look into other transcode front-ends and such.</div>
