					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">In case the other gamers missed it, Quake 4 has been released and Linux support came only two days after retail release! Thanks Id!<br /><br />I&#039;ve been playing for a few minutes and I have to say, it&#039;s good ol&#039; Quake with better graphics and a supporting cast. There is a loose story, but for the most part, it&#039;s run and gun fun. While HL2 brought us a lot of interesting physics puzzles and such, I haven&#039;t found anything like that in Q4 yet. In a lot of ways, it looks like D3, but then again it is based on the same engine. It isn&#039;t as scary as D3 is, but that isn&#039;t so much my bag. It&#039;s just fun. I haven&#039;t tried multiplayer yet, but it should be a good time. So if you could run D3, then you&#039;ll be good to go with Q4.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for the report, Rug.&nbsp; I&#039;m definitely going to get the game, but will wait till sometime next month when I&#039;m done moving, and get my planned system upgrade done.&nbsp; Gonna be playing it maxed out on a new Nvidia 7800GT, and can&#039;t wait!&nbsp; Sounds like it&#039;s gonna be good -- I&#039;ve always loved the Quake games.<br /><br />Dan<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I still haven&#039;t gotten the game, or played it yet, but came across the article below on how to get things running in Linux.&nbsp; Might be helpful for someone trying to play Q4 in Linux:<br /><br />http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=05/11/07/1547208<br /><br />Dan<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">OK, I&#039;ve now gotten the game, and so far I&#039;d agree with Rugmonster...&nbsp; It looks a lot like Doom3 (no real surprise there), and should be a fun experience.<br /><br />As an experiment, I installed it in both Windows2000 and Slackware (on the same dual-boot machine).&nbsp; There is absolutely no question that it looks, sounds, and plays better in the Linux version.&nbsp; I used the exact same settings, and on the Windows version it was barely playable (laggy, unresponsive).&nbsp; The Linux version was quite smooth and playable, and I think it sounded better too.&nbsp; &nbsp;8)<br /><br />As an aside note (you know who you are&nbsp; &gt;:D ), this game is NOT available for console gamers...&nbsp; &nbsp;:o&nbsp; &nbsp;:&#039;(<br /><br />I&#039;m off to slaughter some dirty, stinking Strogg scum.&nbsp; See you back at base.<br /><br />Dan<br /><br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">YESSS!!!! LOL<br /><br />Dan it&#039;s not often you say something I can stick you with as being completely wrong, instead of simply a misguided opinion, but maybe you should do a little of that research I keep talking about before you speak?<br /><br />http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/666/666094p1.html :o ::) :o<br /><br />To make things easier for you in the future, here&#039;s a list of all games confirmed to date going on the 360<br />http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/625/625795p1.html<br /><br />*does a victory dance*&nbsp; ;D ;D</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Oops...&nbsp; OK fair enough, I made a bad ASSumption there, thinking the game was too new to have been released for console.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here&#039;s a favorite quote (author unknown):<br />&quot;Every now and then, even a blind squirrel will find a nut&quot;.<br /><br />&nbsp;;)<br /><br />Dan<br /></div>
