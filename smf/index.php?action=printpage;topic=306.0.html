					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello all...<br /><br />I thought about sparking up another conversation that might bring about some good debate. I found this opinion article (http://newsforge.com/newsforge/02/12/11/0137256.shtml?tid=23) at Newsforge (http://newsforge.com) this morning (it's morning for me). It kind of lit a small inferno in me.<br /><br />Go read the article (http://newsforge.com/newsforge/02/12/11/0137256.shtml?tid=23) and then read the comment I posted to that site. I'm posting it below, but I would like to hear what your take on this is. As a disclaimer, I think that open standards are good, but if you read the article, what I posted makes more sense.<br /><br />~Daniel<br /><br />My post:<br /><br /><br />It's been said before... &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />by Anonymous Reader on 2002.12.14 21:40 (#36726)<br />but I have to say this again in my own words. I don't consider myself one of the choir boys for OSS, but I do support it. It seems that you propose we get behind one distribution and one user environment and support that. What then would make that one distro with that one user interface any different from the lack of choice we get from MS?<br /><br />The point of open source software is freedom. The freedom to choose which software you will use and the freedom to change that software if it fits your needs better to do so. If one distro does something right as a whole, then people will get behind it. Gnome and KDE have become popular and share a majority, but don't steal the thunder from WindowMaker and Blackbox and all the other WINDOW MANAGERS which provide desktop environments. Not everyone likes KDE and not everyone likes Gnome, so they use an alternative if they even use X to begin with. That is their choice. If we eliminate that choice, then what have we gained? Another company or non-profit organization dictating to us what the &quot;standards&quot; will be.<br /><br />It makes me thankful that we have the developers who are responsible for these fine open source products who think differently than you and believe in choice. Standards are good, but don't eliminate the choice to use something else or develop new standards.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm gonna play Devil's Advocate here. (So, what else is new?)<br /><br />Anyway, I like the choice that Linux gives us, but, &nbsp;it's the choice that's holding Linux back from the mainstream and from truely competing with MS. While choice is good, it comes at a price. The price is compatibility. <br /><br />I run Mandrake at home using Gnome as my desktop. Whenever a neat, new application comes out that I'd like to run, I have to ask some questions before I install it.<br /><br />1. Has it been packaged for Mandrake? Each distro uses it's own set of libraries and other things that make it slightly different from other distros. This means that in order for apps to run on your distro they have to be &quot;packaged&quot; for it or you have to become a &quot;Linux Guru&quot; and learn how to install from source. I would never expect my Mom, brothers, or Sisters to learn to install from source. Windows, while not giving the choice, is compatible with all windows software. (Granted you must be running the right version but the same holds true for the Linux kernel you're running.)<br /><br />2. Will it run in my Window manager? Many KDE apps require the KDE libraries in order to run. Granted, the KDE libraries can and usually are loaded even when you run Gnome but this is just a lot more overhead. Besides, if I'm running a KDE app in Gnome, it runs slower than it does under KDE. (That's because it has to load the KDE libraries in the background) The same holds true the other way around.<br /><br />3. If it has been packaged for Mandrake and does run under Gnome, then I still have to ask the killer question. What dependancies does it have? Will I have to find and &nbsp;install a dozen other apps in order for this one to run?<br /><br />So, because I have choices, I also have a lot of work when deciding on loading an application. In the MS world a program written to run on Windows XP installs without any decisions needing to be made. Can you say &quot;Next&quot;? The only questions you need to ask yourself with Windows apps are: Am I running a compatible version of Windows? Do I have enough memory? Is my processor powerfull enough? Each of these questions also holds true for Linux as well as the other questions I mentioned about.<br /><br />By giving me all of the choices that Linux does, it requires that I be a lot more knowledgable about my system and be a lot more carefull when installing software. Thus, it isolates the average Joe Windows user from a very reliable and powerfull operating system.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay, you have all the good points as to why linux isn't making it on the desktop and I agree for the most part (except the one on how it takes a &quot;guru&quot; to install from source). Choice does have its price, but isn't it the distribution makers job to provide their users with packages and a package manager that is intelligent enough to solve dependency problems? Who is to say that Redhat and Mandrake and SuSE and everyone else should bow down to apt or portage because they do the job better?<br /><br />Every distro has a focus and some, like Lindows and Lycoris, focus on the desktop user. They should be the ones coming up with ways to make software installation easy and user-friendly, ie asking as few questions as possible and giving default setups. Then there are the distros like Mandrake, Redhat and SuSE who are sort of middle of the road. They want to focus on usability, but still give the user more choices up front and plenty if you dig. Then there are distros like Slackware, Debian, Gentoo and the non-distro distro of LFS who are focused on the &quot;power user&quot; who want choices and like to customize things to their liking. Let's not forget the specialty distros either. The fact that you have a choice is the key that I'm getting at. Let the desktop distros dumb things down so Joe Sixpack can discover the joys of OSS and make their desktops pretty and frilly, but don't merge all of your distros together and settle for just one way to do it. The author seemed to me to be saying that we should all unite and form one distro and one package management system and one standard for the way &quot;Linux&quot; works. This can easily be thrown to the argument of whether Linux is an OS or just a kernel. Is the OS what the distributions put together or is the OS the combination of the GNU projects endevours combined with the Linux kernel? That is a whole other ball of wax.<br /><br />But yes, your points are valid, but it doesn't apply to how would we implement this &quot;united&quot; front as a Windows killer? To me Linux just isn't suited well as a Joe Sixpack friendly desktop solution by default. It is too modular and has too many options. It takes some thought to setup! Let the Lycoris and Lindows folks make that easy solution though and answer some of the questions for good ol' Joe and make it easier for him to enjoy the benefits of OSS, but don't take away choices from those of us who appreciate them. If you decide to use a distribution that doesn't answer those questions for you, then it should be expected that you learn how to handle dependencies (if you have an inferior package manager :wink: ) and to read the documentation and to &quot;roll your own&quot; occasionally. You will probably end up with a better system in the long run than Mr. Sixpack, but you still have to go through the long part of the run to get there which takes patience and thought.<br /><br /><i>Rugmonster -- Likes to reinvent the wheel every so often and prefers the long way most of the time</i></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok, I'll duck in a minute, but...<br /><br />Linux doesn't have to take over the world. Hell, I don't even believe competing directly with MS should be the goal anymore. Lets all take a deep breath and then get back to making good software for the sheer joy of making good software. By getting ourselves in the competitive mindset, we are, all of us, letting this 1*10^12 pound gorrilla dictate the shape of open source instead of the users and makers of OSS. Forget about Microsoft (and Apple too for that matter). Let them do their thing while we take every opportunity to share the Goodness with others. Sure, steal what works well in those platforms, but do it because *you* think it works well (or your user's do).</div>

Hell, I don't even believe competing directly with MS should be the goal anymore. </div><br /><br />I guess I have to agree here. This is why I run two Linux boxes (One of them is the firewall) and two Windows boxes in the house. There are some areas that Linux just doesn't compete with Windows and we need Windows to fulfill those needs.<br /><br />Actually, this is just giving me a reason to bring up my new project...:) I'm adding a third Windows computer to the house. It is replacing my Stereo, DVD player, VCR, and adding some stuff. I should have it built tonight as the motherboard and CPU arrive tonight. It will be a Intel P4 2.53Ghz system with 512MB of memory, and ATI 8500DV multimedia video card and dual 60GB hard drives. I'm using the Intel D845PEB2T motherboard which has all the standard USB, network, etc. plus SATA Raid, and Dolby 5.1 audio including an optical out. The ATI card has a TV tuner with remote control and inputs and outputs for video and audio equipment. It also has a DVI connector and firewire ports. <br /><br />With all of this said, I will be able to play DVDs, (And record DVDs when I get my recorder) play and record VHS, play CDs, Watch TV and record it as well as time delayed viewing (Pauseing live TV) and a host of other things. Since it will be connected to my network, I'll also be able to surf the net etc. over my TV.<br /><br />Oh, in order to get all af that functionality, I have to be running Windows XP Pro. But, as was previously stated, Linux shouldn't compete with Windows....:)<br /><br />Anyway, I'll update everyone on how it goes tonight with the system. <br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">In my favorite IRC channel, #linux on Efnet, I got my view on OS's and most everything computer related. Linux users (mostly ignorant noobies...stressing the ignorant part) would come in there and start bashing windows and MacOS saying how Linux 0wn3d and stuff. The ops decided after some time of watching these pointless flame wars go on to start kicking those who tried to start these holy wars because it was stupid and immature. The point of this overdrawn story is that each OS has a place and an audience and I agree with rburt and steve. <br /><br />I do think that Linux can be made into a fine desktop that could possibly some day compete with Windows, but that shouldn't be the focus. To make it pass the Grandma test though, it needs a lot of choices hidden and quite a bit of work, which I hope to stay with those &quot;other&quot; distributions. So like I said before, if Lindows or Lycoris or some other entity wants to make that solution, I'll be all for it, I just won't use it. <br /><br />Besides, with the way Linus and crew are taking the latest kernel, I think it is pretty obvious that they are looking to be competitive in the server market. 2.5 hasn't shown to be amazingly better for desktop use, but has tons of new features for server applications.</div>
