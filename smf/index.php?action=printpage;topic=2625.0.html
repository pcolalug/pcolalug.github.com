					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">We used to have a library section to the site. Perhaps imnes still has a copy somewhere. If not, I'll have to look into doing something up.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have of all his code from sourceforge along with many notes I got from Nick about the changes he made for the one we were using somewhere.<br />I will see if I can find them. I was going to work on it and sadly life hit me front and center......Let me know I would be glad to help just more than I can chew by myself.<br />Brett</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well besides my noob php skills, I think a lot of the basic ideas in the project were OK, but trying to learn some of the PHP and come up with the plan as I went made things difficult. &nbsp;If you guys are interested (I don't have much time to put in either), I can come up with a real technical design spec and put up and we can work on a replacement for it. &nbsp;How many of you guys are comfortable in PHP? &nbsp;<br /><br />Also, having access to the server now we can do more to better integrate it with the forum system (shared login would be nice, forum user = library user). &nbsp;<br /><br />Let me know, things seem to be at a standstill right now.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I only have limited time to dedicate right now, but I'm fairly comfortable with PHP and this is something else I would like to have on the site. Right now, most of my effort is going into testing a new forum system for us. With that said, we should probably get that in place first and go from there since there is a good deal of integration we can do between the two projects.</div>
