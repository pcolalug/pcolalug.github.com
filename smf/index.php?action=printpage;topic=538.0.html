					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Steve since you work at Best Buy maybe you can answer this for me. &nbsp;I'm thinking about buying a laptop and was interested in the VPR Matrix lineup at Best Buy. &nbsp;A little research and I found that they are actually manufactured by Best Buy. &nbsp;<br /><br />Would you recommend someone buy that brand, or stick with the more established lines like HP?<br /><br />I heard some bad news about several people having reliability issues with them and having to ship them back to the best buy manufacturing facility for repair which seems to take longer than expected. &nbsp;What's been your experience?<br /><br />And one last thing, any sales / promotions on any of the laptops coming up soon that you know about?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Working in the Service department, I found that the VPR matrix line of systems has been one of the most reliable lines around. We see very few returns due to problems. Unfortunately Best Buy is in the process of upgrading the line and we didn't have any VPRs in stock as of last Saturday.<br /><br />In the laptop arena, I really like the Sony and Toshiba laptops.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay, these are the one's I'm considering, anyone care to comment on any of them? &nbsp;Any recommendations? &nbsp;Which do you think is the best deal overall? &nbsp;BTW: Please disreguard pricing on the various pages, depending on where you buy they're all pretty close to the same price.<br /><br />Compaq Presario 2110US Notebook PC With 1.67 GHz Athlon (http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.gsp?product_id=2069494&cat=4070&type=19&dept=3944&path=0%3A3944%3A3951%3A4070%3A76856)<br /><br />vpr Matrix&#8482; Notebook with Mobile Intel® Pentium® 4 Processor 1.8GHz - M (http://www.bestbuy.com/detail.asp?e=11202473&m=488&cat=494&scat=495)<br /><br />Hewlett-Packard Pavilion Notebook with Intel® Celeron® Processor 1.8GHz (http://www.bestbuy.com/detail.asp?e=11203820&m=488&cat=494&scat=495)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well that sucks did they discontinue the laptop I wanted?<br /><br />I can't find it on their website but I can still link directly to the item<br />http://www.bestbuy.com/detail.asp?e=11202473&m=488&cat=494&scat=495<br /><br />When I click on BUY IT and then &quot;Check for store Availability&quot; it tells me my shopping cart is empty, so I guess they don't carry this any more? &nbsp;<br /><br />I hate that because I was going to head out and buy it tomorrow. &nbsp;Is the company going out of business or they about to bring out a new line or what?<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: imnes</div><div class="quote">Well that sucks did they discontinue the laptop I wanted?<br /><br />Nick</div><br /><br />I checked on this last weekend. Here's the scoop. Best Buy is in the process of reviewing sales on the VPR Matrix line of computers. If sales were good enough then they will roll out a new line of the computers. This is a Best Buy computer so they want to make sure it is a money maker before continue to sell and support it.<br /><br />Meanwhile, go for the Sony or the Toshiba. IMHO they're the best Laptops we currently carry.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I will second the recommendation of the Sony or Toshiba. If you aren't completely concerned with buying locally, Dell makes great laptops as well.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: stocke2</div><div class="quote">...Apple noptebook, they define qualityy harddware.</div><br /><br />Now that I think about it, they are pretty much the best. I haven't ever heard of issues with the Apple notebooks.<br /><br />Also, I might take back my recommendation for Dells. Maybe it was where we were, but I saw a bunch broken...but we did have a few hundred of them and we were in a harsh environment with lots of users beating the crap out of them.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It comes down to price (I can only spend about 1,000 maybe a little more) and what you get for the price.<br /><br />After shopping around I can get 1.8ghz, 512mb ram, 15&quot; screen, DVD+CDRW, 30gb HD at least. &nbsp;Toshiba's are kinda pricey anyways but their lower end models just don't have the specs to compare. &nbsp;Sony I'm not sure I'll have to look into them.<br /><br />Compaq has some nice systems actually, I never liked Compaq but I like HP and they're the same now correct? &nbsp;But they have a really gimpy 1 year warranty (actually most of the laptops I look at now only have a 1yr warranty).<br /><br />I'm buying this to be a linux machine so compatibility is a major issue, most seem to use standard components so it's not a big deal. &nbsp;I wish I could buy one WITHOUT windows bundled and save another $100.<br /><br />Apple's $1k line of ibooks is pretty low on specs. &nbsp;I think the screen's only 12.1&quot;, 128 or 256 ram. &nbsp;And I don't know how to compare their CPUs with the x86 offerings since their faster chips right now are like 800mhz to 1ghz? &nbsp;I dunno. &nbsp;<br /><br />I'm gonna go look around the stores today. &nbsp;I'll let you guys know if I come up with something that I like with the right features and price :)<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">For what it's worth... &nbsp;I've had an HP Pavilion for a couple of years now, and it has been absolutely great. &nbsp;It's somewhat dated by today's standards (P3-700, 256Mb, 14&quot; screen, DVD/CD, 20Gig), but does have built in 10/100 NIC, modem, USB, pcmcia slots. &nbsp;Anyway, never had any problems with it, and has been very compatible with Linux. &nbsp;Very high quality in my opinion.<br />Dan</div>
