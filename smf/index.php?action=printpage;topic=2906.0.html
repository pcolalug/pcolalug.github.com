					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thumbdrives have always worked great for me but one gripe that I have is when you umount a thumbdrive, it does not automatically turn off the thumbdrive light in the process, &quot;like in windows&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;It just makes sense to have a visual to show that it is unmounted.&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />--Lee<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">In Windows, it more or less &quot;removes the device&quot; in that it does the same thing as ejecting the disk. It unmounts it and turns the power off to it. I guess you just have to know that you unmounted the filesystem under linux. Obviously, if you don&#039;t get an error when you give it the umount command, then you are safe. Typically, unless you are using the sync option for the fs, you won&#039;t have problems with just pulling it without unmounting it first, but it&#039;s still recommended to do so first.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I alway umount the device.&nbsp; I think it is good practice to umount thumbdrives.&nbsp; Besides the one time I didnt it will screw and I would corrupt everything on it for sure.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I would just like the light to go off when its un mounted.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Lee,<br /><br />It may be something specific to the thumbdrive you&#039;re using.&nbsp; The one I have only lights up when it&#039;s being accessed, and has no light otherwise, whether it&#039;s mounted or not.&nbsp; Not sure that really helps with anything, but does yours have two lights, one for &quot;plugged in&quot; and one for &quot;accessed&quot;?<br /><br />Dan<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The one I am using now is a sandisk micro.&nbsp; It has only one light.&nbsp; It stays on when plugged in, blinks when accessed.&nbsp; Like I said it works great.&nbsp; I have been using it for months.&nbsp; I have had a couple other brands that was the same way.&nbsp; Not a big deal.&nbsp; Just an observation.&nbsp; <br /><br />Lee</div>
