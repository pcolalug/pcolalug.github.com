					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve been working with Linux for a long time now, but I haven&#039;t learned as much as I should have.<br />For a number of years, I was fascinated by the plusses of Linux but unable to get myself to really work with it, because I hadn&#039;t figured out how to do the important things I needed to do.&nbsp; I started out with Slackware, and it installed great, but then I didn&#039;t know what to do next.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t until, oh, three or four years ago that I got a distro I could really work with.&nbsp; It was Red Hat 7.3, and it was the GUI, ironically, that got me to the point where I could do most of the things I normally do with a computer, only under Linux.&nbsp; Ironic because I am, at heart, a command line person.&nbsp; I learned computers on the C16 and C64, then under MS-DOS.&nbsp; The reason the GUI helped me is that it provided sort of a map for important applications.&nbsp; On the other hand, it allowed me to use things like web browsers and file managers.&nbsp; Still, I do most of my non-visually-oriented functions with the command line.<br />I currently run Debian stable on all my Linux boxen. I use IceWM for my X window manager. I generally use Opera for browsing. Are there other preferences I should mention?<br />I&#039;m interested in learning more. I want to support two things simultaneously: education for computer users so they can be free to choose what to run on their machines, and efforts to make the installation of Linux and its applications easy enough that people who don&#039;t know computers can get a basic system running.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome to the group. I think you will find plenty of kindred spirits here. Especially in your interest to educate people on choices. While our main choice is Linux here, I think most of our members would say you should choose what works best in your situation. Of course that best choice is always Linux.&nbsp; ;D</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I agree that Linux is the best choice. I hope people won&#039;t get upset with me if I tell people who aren&#039;t interested in being sysadmins to switch to Mac. I mean, it&#039;s basically Linux now that Leopard has come out, isn&#039;t it? ;)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">&nbsp; Speaking for myself, I think most distros are good if the user is comfortable with it. I haven&#039;t had a chance to use a MAC, but someday I will pick up an older model just for the experience. I think you will find Linux,as well as MAC and Windows used by our LUG members. However Linux is our preferred distro and it is our aim to promote Linux. Anyway, welcome to the group.<br /><br />Harold</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yeah. I try to get people to switch to Linux, but Mac is a good second choice. :)</div>
