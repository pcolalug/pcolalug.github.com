								<div class="post">How is this bad you ask... Have you ever looked at sad state that most open source project documentation is in? And how many open source project developers would be willing to babysit companies so they could be &quot;competitive&quot;? Yes, the code is out there in the open - but that is not what was asked of Microsoft. The terms you used was &quot;anyone with the know how....&quot;, so does this mean that a Java centric software shop should get special treatment because the original code is in C? Rulings and requirements like this will open the door to this type of stupidity.<br /><br />I agree with you about we live in a mixed economy, otherwise farm, dairy, oil &amp; gas industries would have to charge what it really cost to produce their products (And you thought $3.59 a gallon was high for milk). Oddly, I have no problem with that, as it does have a benefit to all consumers. What I don&#039;t agree with you is your statement &quot;The businesses with the best strategies would form monopolies and make it nearly impossible for any potential competitor to enter the market.&quot;. Short of buying all of your competition, you can&#039;t &quot;form&quot; a monopoly. Does Microsoft have a monopoly? Not at all. Last time I checked RealNetworks and Apple are still their own entities. Is Microsoft guilty of anti-competitive behaviour? Absolutely, as they essentially forced vendors to install their software (and not install their competitions) or be cut out completely. Did Microsoft get put in their place? Yes, as vendors are now willing to provide systems with other OS (such as Dell&#039;s w/RHEL) without fear of retribution from Microsoft. Do I consider &quot;bundling&quot; (including a browser and media player with the OS) a bad thing? Absolutely not, provided it does not prevent me from installing a 3rd party application which last time I checked, Quicktime and Firefox ran just fine even though WMP &amp; IE are installed by default. If it was a bad idea, then why does most linux distributions include Totem &amp; Firefox with the default install? Convenience, and that is what Microsoft is guilty of - making applications convenient. <br /><br />Going back to the monopoly issue, take Linux for example. Linux has thrived and even become a household name AFTER Microsoft was deemed a monopoly (which I don&#039;t believe they are). If what you said was true, then Linux wouldn&#039;t have a chance. However, what has happened is that Linux (when combined with other open source projects such as Apache and MySQL) have been able to prove itself as a better alternative. So far, that is only true in the server realm, as there are way more Linux installs than Windows NT/2000/2003 servers. As Linux on the desktop becomes more mature, and more mainstream apps are either ported to Gnome/KDE, an equal shift in the market share will take place. Companies like Redhat and Novell are working this angle, as the typical cubicle mole only needs a web browser, an email client and an office suite to be productive. Can you say Firefox, Thunderbird &amp; OpenOffice? The best thing that has happened for Linux on the desktop is Vista. I would bet one of the top 3 reasons Vista has been delayed isn&#039;t due to security issues, but the fear that once Vista rolls out and support for XP begins to taper off, companies will then have a REASON to migrate to something other than Microsoft. It almost happened in the transition from 2000 to XP, but Desktop Linux wasn&#039;t mature enough yet. Now that it is, Microsoft has plenty of reason to keep milking the XP cash cow as long as possible.<br /><br />Now take Apple for example - Again another competitor that has been able to make it without having to whine about Microsoft being a monopoly. <br />Granted, I believe they exist strictly for those people who despise Microsoft so much, they are willing to put their money where their mouth is. If more people would do this, Microsoft wouldn&#039;t be able to &quot;bastardize&quot; the protocols as you put it and call it &quot;innovation&quot;. At the end of the day, my point remains there are too many companies that would rather cry foul about not having a &quot;fair market&quot; to work in instead of putting forth the effort to just make a better product.<br /><br /></div>

								<div class="post">Here is some ramblings of mine to provoke some thought....<br /><br />At some point, Microsoft needs to consider is it even financially feasible to remain in Europe. Does it even clear $2M a day from its EU operations? Possible, but if Microsoft wanted to push a point, they could revoke the EULA for all EU countries, and then let the commission scratch their head and wonder &quot;what do we do now?&quot;. Some may say that this would be great as it would create an opportunity for the open source community, however that would not be the case, because the same documentation requirements would be imposed upon anything that would fill the void, less the EU look like an idiot.<br /><br />I am by no means a Microsoft fan at all, in fact I&#039;m far from it. But look at the precedents this is now creating not only in the OS vendor space, but also how France is looking at imposing requirements to force Apple to allow any content on IPods, and force ITunes to play on competitor devices. Its time governments quit monkeying with the markets and let users decide for themselves instead of being puppets for inept companies that couldn&#039;t program their way out of a wet paper bag. Nothing is stoping these companies from writing their own OS, and in the case of the IPod, there are so many other personal music devices out there, that if consumer X really wanted it in another format, there&#039;s nothing stoping them.<br /><br />To put all this in perspective, lets say you were to create a widget and spent your hard money to patent it, trademark it and market it. It becomes so popular that 90% of all widgets sold were yours. You&#039;ve also created a line of accessories to attach to your widget. XYZ Company now comes forward and complains that you don&#039;t provide the engineering data needed so they can create their own accesories to compete with you. This should get laughed out of court, however if you were to apply what has happened to Microsoft, you would be compelled to provide that data, even though its protected by your patents and is considered a trade secret. Pretty crappy if you ask me, which leads to the inevitable - Why bother creating anything for a profit if the governments of the world are just going take it away from you. The world (including open source companies) work on the principal of making a profit, and snatching the rug from under the innovators of the world by taking away their motive is a scarry thought.<br /><br />Just for grins, apply the above widget example to any open source project. While it may look good on the surface to see them &quot;stick it to Microsoft&quot;, it is only a precursor of what could become a nightmare for the open source community.<br /><br />Any comments? <br /><br />Jesse<br /><a href="http://www.hitechwholesale.com" target="_blank">http://www.hitechwholesale.com</a></div>

Keyword is &quot;calculated&quot;, not stored in a variable. For your project, don&#039;t rely on the precision of the variables, but examine the method of how you would determine the correct answer. You&#039;ll probably find that all you need are simple integers and allocate space to store the result. As you keep iterating through the process refining the answer to higher precision, you&#039;ll more than likely either dump the result to screen, or store in a char type location.

								<div class="post">One project is a revamp/redesign an e-commerce site that is already in PHP,&nbsp; and three projects are browser based apps, using the AXIS model to retrieve data via webservices that are written in PHP. Just me, but at quick glance at ROR reminds me WAY to much of Perl &amp; Java, both of which I am fairly proficient at, just choose not to use them as they introduce too many problems. With Java, the problem is the client now needs a JRE in addition to the browser. Get the wrong JRE (or worse, the Microsoft JRE)and its crash and burn. Perl would have been a second choice to PHP, but the problem there is knowing which modules you need, and having to know modules exist before you reinvent the wheel. The botton line is that PHP was chosen for its flexibility to run in either Windows or Linux environments, its ability to run via the command line, and my favorite, the ability to run as a procedural language, an OO language, or as I like to use it, a combination of both models.<br /><br /></div>

								<div class="post">You obviously haven't been to the lab lately. <img src="Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0" /><br /><br />Provided they haven't changed them in the last 10 months, those sparc's lost their's years ago. What's solaris on now? Version 10?<br /><br />If I remember right, they're still running v6 at best. Look at the CS Department's administrator's resume <a href="http://www.cs.uwf.edu/~credding/resume.html" target="_blank">http://www.cs.uwf.edu/~credding/resume.html</a>..<br /><br />Anybody that's still touting TRSDOS (TRS-80 Model I-IV OS, used in 1980-1989) and PRODOS (Apple II/c/e/gs &quot;professional&quot; OS) as relevant experince, plus lacking a degree himself is laughable. I can say this since I (finally) finished my CIS degree in December last year (only took 17 years), and almost all of the classes I took (including the web courses and the 15 credits I tested out by examination) are, at best 5-10 years behind the tech curve. The only person I remember that was remotely current was Dr. Edwards, which I had for OS. Guess which OS was his favorite? (answer: Linux), But because there wasn't a Linux lab, all of our projects had to work on those ancient sparcs. The only good thing was that 99% of the code (which was in C) written in Linux also worked on the Sparcs, the exception being some library that &nbsp;I don't remember off the top of my head.<br /><br />Another peculiar thing about UWF, is why does the Business department run the SAIL lab instead of the CS Department? Because the Business department has all the new equipment is my guess. These are just a few reasons why I chose not to return to get my masters - yes the paper works just fine, but I have issues with spending time and not learning anything. The only thing I gained from UWF during my time there was all of the academia terms for the things I had been doing on my own for the past 20+ years.</div>
