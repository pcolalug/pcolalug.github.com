					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello! I&#039;m Patrick and I&#039;m a upcoming student at UWF. Currently I live in Winter Haven but I&#039;m coming up to Pensecola in the Fall. I&#039;m interested in programming and know the basics of C, Python, and C++, although I have decided to really get into C++ due to the widespread use of it and it&#039;s versatility.<br /><br />Personally I&#039;ve only tried Ubuntu, but I&#039;ve really loved my experience with it and am keeping with it for now! I&#039;m a bit of an all around geek and my interestests range from computer programming to real time strategy to litiature and music. I hope to get to know you guys in the future! =D<br /><br />&nbsp;</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thank you and I will be sure to come to a meeting! Just out of curiosity though, does anyone have any suggestions for Linux distros? I&#039;m running Ubuntu but I want to look into some others, but really can&#039;t decide on what to try next.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi Patrick and welcome to the group.&nbsp; As far as other possible distros, check out http://distrowatch.com (http://distrowatch.com).&nbsp; A couple I especially like, in addition to ubuntu, are Linux Mint and Mepis.&nbsp; Also, If you have a spare older computer you may want to try ZenWalk 6.0.&nbsp; However, there are many other good distros and it is probably difficult to find one that isn&#039;t good.<br /><br />Good luck at UWF.&nbsp; Thank goodness I finally gradiated and am oficilly edumkated.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome to the group. I am currently running Kubuntu, but have recently ran Slackware and like it. There are plenty to play with out there. Some are very application specific. Not that you can&#039;t do anything with all of them, but some are better for running certain types of servers than others. They are custom built for different needs. But all around you will probably like the distros based off of Debian or Slackware.</div>
