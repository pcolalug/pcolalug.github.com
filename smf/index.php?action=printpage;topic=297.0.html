What is it that would hold you back for those windows systems who could for all practical purposes be replaced by a linux desktop?<br /><br />-------<br />Ruggy<br /><br /><i>this really should have been another topic</i></div><br /><br />My boss and I have discussed this many times in the past and the problem that keeps coming up is that very few bussineses, that we deal with, use just an Office suite and e-mail. Most bussineses including ours use some sort of proprietary application and they are usually Windows based. Here are a a couple of examples:<br /><br />1. The company I work for is a MS solution provider and programming company for the Govt. Our programmers use the MS Visual Developers suite because all of our clients requirements revolve around Windows. These are clients that have contracted us to write applications for them, not to reccomend an OS. So, we are locked in, in that case. &nbsp;We also host web sites for clients that require Active X as well as Front Page publishing and some other publisher that uses IIS. Again, locked in.<br /><br />2. Some of our clients are Law Firms. They require a practice menagement application to handle their clients cases. These apps have the law time lines built into them such as fileing requirements, etc. I haven't seem any Linux based Law Firm Practice managent software. In addition, some of them use terminal services. This would be great in Linux, except that the application being served up, again, is a program called ProLaw. Look it up on the Web. It requires a Windows Server.<br /><br />3. We also had a client that was in the rental car bussines. They also had software to manage their rental car agency. It tied into a national database for rental agencies. Again, Windows based.<br /><br />4. Finally, our biggest clients are US Government. They bought heavily into MS years ago and even with all the talk about the government looking at Linux they have yet to take any actions. (At least our clients haven't taken any actions)<br /><br />5. We also have a fast food franchise client. Again, corporate HQ has a couple of Windows based apps that are required. Stuck again.<br /><br />Now you may ask, why not just run something like WINE? &nbsp;IS the time worth the cost? Remember, our companies time is money. When we can install Windows and get the Windows apps up and running without even cracking the quick start guide, we're making money. When we have to setup WINE, tweak it for the App we want to run, test it, and then have no support from the manufacturer for problems with the app, because we aren't running it under Windows, that costs us money.<br /><br />Finally, hardware. Businesses require more robust hardware than is currently supported under Linux. For instance, Xerox priniter that's the size of a small desk and was just released on the market, does it have Linux drivers for all of it's functions like printing, copying, faxing, scanning, and yes e-mailing, We have a client that has one of these. They are network devices but only use Windows drivers. We can't tell a client that when they need to buy hardware that they need to be extra carefull and make sure it will work under Linux. (Don't say you need to do the same thing with Windows. Face it, Windows is the standard when manufaturers develop drivers and hardware apps.)<br /><br /><br />So, back to your original question. If I happen to find a small client that only needs to surf the net, e-mail, and do office documents and nothing else, then I would reccomend Linux. (If they ask) The other thing is to not scare a client into thinking they need a major overhaul to get their bussines done. This only scares them off. If they are happily using Windows I will never knock it unless they ask for a recommendation.<br /><br />Just my 2 cents.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Doesn't SuSE already have an Exchange-killer in the works/available? The German gvmt is also funding development into OSS groupware stuff and integrating it into KDE, last I heard.<br /><br />Having known many an Exchange admin, I've got to say that it seems more trouble than its worth. Doesn't play nice, doesn't clean up after itself, and do enough employees use the groupware features, beyond email, to justify the inordinate expendatures of time (admins) and money that Exchange demands? Can't we all just get along and use Postfix and PHPGroupware? &nbsp;:D<br /><br />Now, would I pay for MS software running on Linux? In a heartbeat, if we're talking about Mechwarrior or Dungeon Seige. As for office productivity, communications, multimedia, and development, I'll pass. There's just too much free software out there that is as good or better than the commercial offerings in those arenas.</div>

Can't we all just get along and use Postfix and PHPGroupware? &nbsp;:D<br /></div><br /><br />1. Having run 9 Exchange servers for 7000 clients in Santa Rosa, Exchange plays very nice if you know what you're doing. Too many Exchange admins, like Windows Server admins, think they know what they're doing because of MSs GUI interface. Just because it has a GUI interface doesn't mean that someone knows what theey're doing. &nbsp;Believe me, just like sendmail, postfix, and other Linux e-mail programs, there's more to it that what you see on the surface. Don't get me wrong, it's very easy to manage 1 to 100 Exchange servers if you understand Exchange. I would never try to manage an enterprise network running sendmail without seriously understanding how sendmail works. However, alot of people try to do just that with MS products just because they have a nice GUI. <br /><br />2. Yes, from my experiance a lot of emplyees that are running on an Exchange server do use the groupware functions. The ability to tie meetings into e-mails, address books, and calendars is a very cools feature. Also, the ability to store any kind of document in an Exchange folder and work on right there is used time and time again by the users I deal with.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I get the joy to administer 4 exchange servers here (soon to be 8) and I can say they can be a headache sometimes. Our users primarily use it for personal and shared email accounts. They don't do office scheduling or much anything else with it. I think the main thing they do use that exchange offers is centralized calendars, because not everyone gets on the same system everytime. Granted, I've never touch an Exchange server before coming out here, but I don't really see an advantage for using it as solely an email server compared to what is available out there compared to the few hassels I've had with it. <br /><br />As far as the government goes, I understand completely. They have way too much invested in MS products. Commercial entities are the same way. I understand that and when you are doing development for other companies, you are pretty much stuck. I was mainly referring to those folks who mainly only use things that you can find in OSS world. <br /><br />For the gov, I hope eventually they start realizing the advantages of OSS (which they are, considering they have the Open Standards Initiative). Maybe before I get out, I'll be able to help some poor sob get his linux desktop working or get to administer a linux server (and be rid of IIS!!!)<br /><br />-------<br />Ruggy</div>

Ruggy, care to comment? </div><br /><br />Well, the AF has this thing called the Open Standards Initiative (or something like that and it may be DoD wide), but the whole thing is pretty much to move away from proprietary when an open standard is available. I don't know how that might apply to OSs though. I know in my NCC, I run some open source software like MRTG (http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/mrtg/) and Liberum Helpdesk (http://www.liberum.org) (which I have modified heavily), but our servers are all MS. <br /><br />I would say the AF is more likely to use the right tool for the job than anyone, but they also have to look at the investments they have made. If MS decides to change their licensing plan to cover be good time limited, I see it being a good opportunity for us to start moving away from them for less expensive alternatives (read OSS).<br /><br />Those of you who contract with the DoD know they are happy with NT and they use something up until it just doesn't work any more. I've found a sparcstation and an amiga up at my homestation being used still today. They work, so why get rid of them?<br /><br />-------<br />Ruggy</div>

Again, it comes back to what the programmers are writing in. In this case, the application that interfaces with the national database is a Windows Application.<br /><br /><br />You know, we can all theorize about which is the better way to go. And yes, if I was starting out a company I would try to include Linux where I could. However, when it comes to the real world, MS has the foot hold and you never ask a bussiness to change from what they are happy with and is not killing their budget. If a CIO or CEO was complaining about their IT costs then I'd mention Linux. If they budget $1,000,000/year use MS and have $300,000 left over at the end of the year. Then stick with what you know and are familiar with.<br /><br />If my neighbor has a car that gets 15 MPG, tops out at 50 MPH, and he only drives it to and from work downtown to his $80,000/yr job, I'm not going to try to push him into a new 35 MPG car that tops out at 150 MPH. Why? His current car serves his needs, is payed for, and he is familiar with it. <br /><br />While Linux is nice, I wouldn't be running it if it weren't, I have to keep the &quot;cost of change&quot; in mind when talking to clients.<br /><br />Steve</div>

We did that in the Govt when we migrated from Lotus cc:Mail to Exchange. Even though Exchage had more features and the users didn't use most of the features in cc:Mail, they complained about the loss of features when it was taken away from them. &nbsp;Go figure. &nbsp;:D <br /><br />A couple of things about Exchange that people don't understand.<br /><br />1. A lot of the groupware functionality that isn't used is because it's not setup/pushed/advertised by the administrators. Many administrators don't know about the power Exchange offers you. &nbsp;<br />A good example is that you can develop custom forms in it using pretty much drag and drop programming. I developped a whole helpdesk section in our Exchange server within a couple of days keeping us fram having to buy or install a seperate helpdesk app. <br />Another feature rarely used is public folders. In Exchange, you can setup public folder for groups of users. &nbsp;They can manage them as well as hide them from other users/groups. We use this extensivle for manageing different departments. We setup a folder hierarchy for the admin department that contains their own shared address book, contact lists, calendar, etc. It works out great. <br />In our company, we have seperate folders setup for each of our contracts that contains all e-mail, contacts, scheduleing, and documents, etc pertaining to the contract. Then when we get a new person on board and they are working with that contract, we just add them to the folder permissions. <br /><br />Many companies setup shared directories on thier servers for a lot of this stuff. That can all be integrated into Exchange so it's one stop shopping for everything from personal e-mail to documents on a contract or even stored files. All of this can be stored in Exchange. Most Exchange administrators either, don't know about all of these features or don't know how to impliment them.<br /><br />This is why Exchange is so powerful as a groupware solution. Again, I'm waiting to see what SuSE comes out with.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here's (http://eltoday.com/article.php3?ltsn=2002-12-11-001-15-NW) a possible answer to the Citrix lock-in. Neat! Gotta love Codeweavers. Sure, use OSS where possible, but, as mentioned here, business have many more factors to consider. Any speculation about Codeweavers releasing a commercial version of WINE in the near future? I wish these guys would address games, man (I know about Transgaming, and even was a member for a while, but I never did get satisfactory results). They're doing an awsome job of productivity apps.</div>
