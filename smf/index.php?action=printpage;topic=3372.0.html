					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">So we need to generate some more interest in the LUG.&nbsp; I hoped to come up with a few more ideas since I last posted, but haven&#039;t really had time to even think about it, so I&#039;ll list the ideas presented so far, and ask for discussion and more ideas.<br /><br />One thought given was that we could use more social activities, nothing set in stone but perhaps just random get-togethers such as cookouts, things that are less computer-related.<br /><br />One method of increasing attendance could be to move the meeting night to a weekday, when people who work in town are going to be in town anyways, so that they don&#039;t have to make a special trip for a routine meeting.&nbsp; This would also remove any conflict between someone wanting to go out on Saturday and go bar hopping/partying/clubbing/dating/etc.<br /><br />We could try to increase our online presence more, in an effort to make it easier for people in the area who are looking online to find us.&nbsp; This could consist of posting to shared calendar sites, or possibly starting a linux-related podcast.<br /><br />We do need to increase our presence locally, with fliers, affiliating with other local tech related clubs, and possibly even radio spots on local tech-related talk shows.<br /><br />It was also suggested that we put together some form of crash course that people can enroll in and learn to get their hands dirty with Linux.<br /><br />That&#039;s all I have for now, let&#039;s get some healthy discussion going.<br /><br />Ian</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Good ideas, Ian.<br /><br />Some ideas I&#039;ve been thinking about:<br /><br />- Try to get local organizations to donate old computers to the lug so they could be loaded with Linux and given away to promote interest.<br /><br />- Lug Flyers posted at UWF and PJC, etc.<br /><br />- Make Live CD&#039;s with the lug logo and give away.<br /><br />- Perhaps start some type of group project?&nbsp; Of course, this could turn into a major headache, but may be worth at least discussing.<br /><br />- Do more lug presentations at the ITGulfCoast monthly meetings.&nbsp; Brett has done several so far.&nbsp; I am willing to volunteer to do a Linux presentation at a future ITGulfCoast meeting, if they&#039;re interested.&nbsp; IMO, I think the lug can really catch on if we can get the ear of the business community.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Now I can&#039;t take any credit for those previous ideas, they&#039;re all input that I&#039;ve received from other members in the past.<br /><br />Your ideas sound nice for promoting us and Linux to the business world.&nbsp; In the past week I was contacted to do a logo swap with the Florida Linux Show, which is a show oriented towards Linux/FOSS as an option for businesses, they also asked if there was any possibility that we&#039;d want to host their show in our area in the next year or two.&nbsp; Unfortunately I don&#039;t think we have the ability to do so in 2009, but I told him it could possibly happen in 2010 if we manage to get some members who are willing to donate lots of time and effort to such a goal.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Really the weekday thing sounds great to me, if it were on say Thursday or Friday I would be there every single time.<br /><br />We have a lot of members we just need to get a day they can all come. I for one have always appreciated the presentations that were made during the meetings. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I agree with the venue change to another night and also maybe a mix up once in a while with the location say once or twice a year something like the computer science labs at uwf and pjc I am sure with my contacts we could get access if we invited students in to have a show and tell on linux.<br />Group projects Dennis as you know get to be a whole other issue and I think we should steer clear till we are back on our feet again.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">1. How about moving the meeting site to Pace. I live in Jay and I know we have at least one member in Crestview. Split the drive so it will be about the same for everybody. Brett how about trying to get a meeting place at the PJC/UWF campus in Pace.<br />2. I would not be interested in just get-to-gathers. I come/came for the linux.<br />3. It is not worth the effort to drive an hour to a meeting to set around and watch someone you don&#039;t even know peck on a laptop for an hour and a half and then make an hours drive home. What is the point of a meeting if there is no agenda, no presentation, no old business or new business discussion.<br />4. I think the presentations should be geared more to the desktop user. I can&#039;t see many new members joining to learn how to be a linux IT guru. I think we could grow if we designed some presentations and howtos on setting up one or more linux distros that are geared towards the windows user not slackware, debian or gentoo. First learn ourselves how to setup and use the applications a desktop user would use. Then learn and be able to instruct them on multimedia. I think multimedia would be a real draw to convert windows users to linux. They want to be able to rip and burn cd&#039;s, mp3&#039;s, dvd&#039;s and the like. How to make and edit your home movies. How to edit and store your pictures. <br />5. I am not in favor of group projects like Campfire. We had a lot of volunteers but no commitment but a lot of excuses.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think we are ready for things like that yet.<br />6. As far as meeting nights I would not have them on Wednesday (church night).<br /></div>

They want to know how to do the multimedia stuff and how to use their old programs in Linux. <br /><br />On the flip side, some of us have gone past that point, and are excited to become very proficient. I think that a split schedule would be cool, for instance one month basics next month something a little more advanced. <br /><br />For instance I just converted my brother to using Linux and the first thing he wanted, (after making it rain on his desktop) is to use a N64 Emulater. Next he wanted Tabit to work in Linux. That is a windows based program (which i&#039;m still working on the sound). So entertainment then utility. Now he has started to ask about things like bash scripts. So it goes Entertainment, Utility, then Advanced. The first two things must be met before the 3rd.<br /><br />I&#039;ll stop rambling</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, since I was the one asking for a response/ideas, I should probably say something.&nbsp; I debated whether to reply, or not, as some will think I&#039;m a &quot;negative-Nelly&quot; after reading this post, but I prefer the term &quot;realist&quot;.<br /><br />All of the ideas that have been proposed are good ones.&nbsp; The problem is that they have been done/tried before, and there just was never enough interest by more than half a dozen folks to make them amount to anything.&nbsp; Let me explain what I mean a little:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; If we can&#039;t get folks to come to a Linux meeting, why would we think anyone would be interested in coming to a non-computer event?&nbsp; We all have enough of that going on already, and that is the most common reason for non-attendance (&quot;too busy&quot;).&nbsp; I don&#039;t see it happening.<br />2.&nbsp; The presentations - we have already done both &quot;new-user&quot; and &quot;advanced&quot; presentations.&nbsp; I did many of them myself.&nbsp; There was very little interest shown for any of them, and of course we only ever had a dozen or so show up.&nbsp; Not saying we shouldn&#039;t try them again, but *first* we gotta get some chairs filled.&nbsp; It&#039;s almost a chicken-and-egg situation.&nbsp; Will people come to see a presentation?&nbsp; What&#039;s the point of a presentation given to 3 people...?<br />3.&nbsp; I agree with the comments about the community projects.&nbsp; Lots of talk, but no action.&nbsp; Don&#039;t see that changing, to be honest.<br />4.&nbsp; There may be some benefit to moving the meeting to a weekday evening.&nbsp; I dunno.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t much matter to me either way.&nbsp; Not sure how I feel about moving the location, it is after all, the &quot;Pensacola&quot; Linux Users Group.&nbsp; Again, the real issue is getting folks from &quot;Pensacola&quot; to show up.<br />5.&nbsp; As for LUG fliers and CD&#039;s...&nbsp; I personally made hundreds of (color) flyers, passed them out to a few folks for further spreading, posted a bunch myself, and many of them never got posted as far as I know.&nbsp; I also made 30-50 CD&#039;s with the LUG logo on them (for Brett) once.&nbsp; I don&#039;t believe either effort had *ANY* effect on membership/participation.&nbsp; It was a lot of work, and there was never anything positive to come out of it.<br />6.&nbsp; Radio ads are just not gonna happen.&nbsp; Who&#039;s going to pay for that?<br />7.&nbsp; The integration with other groups/clubs is probably a good thing.&nbsp; Again, it will come down to more than one/two people willing to actually do something.&nbsp; The interest level may spike for a month, but will likely fade out again quickly.&nbsp; I could be wrong, but experience has shown otherwise.<br /><br />I could probably go on some more, but I think you get the idea.&nbsp; As someone else stated, I also want the LUG to survive and grow.&nbsp; Probably more than most.&nbsp; I tend to be rather blunt with what I say, and sometimes that hurts people&#039;s feelings.&nbsp; Sorry, but that&#039;s how it is.&nbsp; Sometimes that is needed to jolt people into thinking and taking some action.&nbsp; Most of my statements here are entirely based on watching the LUG deteriorate over the last 5 years.&nbsp; I am very willing to help out with things, but at the same time I am &quot;gunshy&quot; about getting too excited only to see things fizzle.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what the answers are to fix things, and I&#039;m gonna just sit back and watch for now.&nbsp; I gave a lot of effort and time in the past to this LUG, and am not willing to do it again until I see the same level of willingness from some others.&nbsp; Again, sorry for my bluntness, and if you&#039;d like to just tell me to &quot;F-off&quot;, then go right ahead.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be around, and hopeful.<br /><br />Dan<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Perhaps a way to get more people in the group would be to make a concerted LUG effort to participate in a high-profile online community that Linux users are likely to see that could be pointed back toward the LUG (an example, probably not a good one, would be devoting some time to expanding a Linux-related Wiki - not sure how that could be branded, so it&#039;s probably not a good idea, but it may spark a good idea that could work). I think there may be a lot of Linux users in the area who simply aren&#039;t aware of this group, but they probably are aware of non-regional Linux resources. Maybe this is a worthless idea, but I think a discussion is worthwhile.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">that is very true green dragon...i&nbsp; remember i bought some computers from a guy in Pensacola via craigslist and when i went in his house i noticed that he was running fedora, i then told him about the lug. Im sure he just shrugged it off. But I am sure there are alot of local people who know nothing about the lug. I dont know how we could spread the word... the only thing i can think is signs and such at places everyday people go. EVERYONE buys groceries and such. Not to sure if this is even worth mentioning, but it wont hurt.</div>

I don&#039;t remember the name of it, but we could probably buy a small ad in there.<br /><br />Any local flier, even if it is not specifically computer related might be a good place to look.<br /><br />We could pass around a hat and take up a collection to pay for a small ad.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well on my end I have been in contact with O&#039;reilly to keep us in books and have been posting how-to&#039;s each week as stated and have an entire learning series of presentations to setup once I have been given the go ahead. prefer more than one week as I am studing for my RHCE retake. Also giving presentation to UWF soon as they have contacted me for a second one and also PJC. IT gulfcoast wants a Linux demo we are trying to coordinate that with either PJC or UWF for the computer lab to host it and then we will need some linux jockeys and live distros. Also writing first draft of my soon to be print article on open-source. :)</div>
