					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello all,&nbsp; I am over in PC. What day/time is the monthly meeting?&nbsp; I saw it somewhere in here but cant find it now.&nbsp; I have been using linux lightly for about 3-4 years.&nbsp; I can barely do stuff in windows so in linux I am a complete dufus.&nbsp; I can install a complete OS from a magazine cover disk but that is about all.&nbsp; I would like to get to know how to do things with &quot;zipped files/gzipped/tarz/tars&quot; and how to get some of the games from one distro disk onto the harddrive underneath the distro I have on there without removing the current distro.&nbsp; (dont laugh, this is hard stuff for some people)&nbsp; If it dosnt work when I double click it&#039;s icon the computer / software is as good as broke.&nbsp; &quot;Did anyone call Nick Burns?&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;... &quot;I dont like that guy&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; .....&nbsp; &quot;Its the computer that&#039;s stupid isn&#039;t it.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;... &quot;MOVE!!!&quot; <br /><br />Well anyway I am Will. I live in Panama City. I will be showing up if at all possible.&nbsp; I am a plumber.&nbsp; I have had an Amiga 500 ; a gateway WinME (now) ; a linux tryout box from walmart. and the various comp;uters they use at work.&nbsp; I am really tired of Nick Burns and would like to get better at this stuff.&nbsp; Firefox installed at work by me! so hard.!?! I use open office at home. and foxit reader (PDF) at home and work just so I can be different/difficult.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sunsete@comcast.net</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome to the group Will.<br /><br />The meetings are third Saturday of the month at 6:00 pm. The actual date can be found at the main page: www.pcolalug.org.<br /><br />I would recommend a distro that makes installation of new software pretty simple. There are Suse (http://www.novell.com/products/suselinux/downloads/) and Mandriva (http://www.mandriva.com/download) that seem to be pretty popular. If you have a somewhat recent machine (Windows ME age range is not recent enough) you might try FreeSpire (http://freespire.org/). It is pretty easy to install software from. It will require an Internet connection to do so, but simple to do.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome to the group.  It is always great when someone else expresses interest in learning more about Linux and alternatives to the dark side.<br /><br />Another great way to get your feet wet with Linux is to try out a Live-CD distro.  These distros just boot and run right from the CD.  A few of my favorites are DSL (Darn Small Linux), Puppy Linux, and Simply Mepis.  An excellent web-site for info on all types of distros is: http://distrowatch.com/.<br /><br />Again, welcome.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome. I had several changelles with Linux at first. Keep reading and asking questions and you will get there.</div>
