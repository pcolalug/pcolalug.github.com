					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey, I&#039;m new here. My name is Mike and I work at a local accounting firm in downtown Pensacola. I&#039;ve been playing around with Linux on and off for quite a few years, although I&#039;m still very much a novice. I found this group from a search online, so I decided to check it out. I plan on being at the Oct 20th meeting, as long a something doesn&#039;t get in the way. Hope to see y&#039;all there. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yeah, looks like I&#039;m going to miss this meeting. I&#039;ll be out of town on the 27th. I&#039;ll probably be missing the November one too since I&#039;ll be out of town on the third Saturday. Maybe I&#039;ll get to make the December one. I&#039;ll keep trying until I do make a meeting. :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome. I know that most of us played around with Linux for a while before jumping in full time. You will find a great group of people here who will be happy to help you get things straightened out.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, it looks like I might actually make it to the December meeting. After several months of trying to get there, I might just be able to do it.</div>
