					Title: <b>Boot loader goes bye bye</b><br />
					Post by: <b></b> on <b>August 18, 2003, 07:43:03 am</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok, I have a problem, and hopefully someone here has some experience with this sort of thing.<br /><br /><br />I run a dual-boot system. I have an 80 GB partition with Winblows on it, and a 40GB partition with RH Linux 8 on it. I generally only use Winblows because I'm a 3D artist, and my 3D programs only run on Winblows at current. I use Linux for everything else.<br /><br />However, I had a problem with the registry of Winblows a few days ago, and had to reinstall. Normally this would be a smooth operation, and it was. However, it seems that the monopolistic tendecies of Microsft have led them to overwrite the boot loader so that only winblows can be booted.<br /><br />Now, I am dying here without Linux, and I have never configured a boot loader before. If anyone could help guide me through the process of installing GRUB or LILO, and configuring it, I would greatly appreciate their help</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">devilmech,<br /><br />First of all, welcome to the LUG - I think you'll find these forums helpful, and interesting.<br /><br />What's happened to you is common, and luckily it's easy to fix. &nbsp;For me, I can help you with Grub, and I know others here can with Lilo. &nbsp;So, which were you using before the re-install of windows?<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I was using GRUB before. I don't really know the difference between the two loaders, so I don't really know which one I should install now. I think with LILO being older, it would be more evolved, but I could be wrong.<br /><br />btw, GRand Unified Boot Loader sounds like something developed by the Freemasons</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You know, this could be as simple as setting the linux partition as the boot partition....<br /><br />And yes, that can be done with fdisk from windows.<br /><br />Mind you will have to add the winders partition to the grub config.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you have cd one from your distro you can start like you are going to reinstall but instaed when ask do and update.<br />This will even let you choose which boot loader you would like and reinstall it. IT only takes about 10 minutes and has worked for me for Grub and Lilo.<br />Then again there is more than one way to skin a cat!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks to all for the helpage. I was able to boot into Linux from the DVD, and from there proceeded to reinstall GRUB and set things back the way I had them.<br /><br />Was a nice slap in the face to me, and another blow to my trust in Microsuck, which was rather nonexistent to begin with.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You have to look at it from the standpoint of Microsoft making it easier on the user by installing a standard bootloader and MBR. How many average Joe Six-Packs do you know dual boot? For them to add this question to the installation process would only confuse people. I don't see it so much as monopolistic practice as I do simpler installation. It's just one of those behaviors you have to be aware of and ready to work around if you plan on dual booting with Windows.</div>
