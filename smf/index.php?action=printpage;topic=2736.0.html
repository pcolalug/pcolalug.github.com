					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I started with an lcd projector screen that I bought some time ago for the overhead projector project. It is only black and white and 640x480 nothing to fancy.<br />I had grown board of it&#039;s limited ability some time ago and it has been collecting dust. Well now it has a new life ....I first ripped the whole thing down to it&#039;s bare components and ended up with an lcd with a nice little plastic frame for mounting and the associated electronics on one board. One problem I had is there was a limit of then about 4 inches due to a small 16 conductor flat cable. I pulled it loose and desoldered the edge connectors paying attention to the pin numbering on each end. I&nbsp; then soldered two pieces of 8 conductor cable about 2.5 feet long between the controls and the lcd screen.....My first attempt was a success.....<br />I then hung the lcd over my 21&quot;monitor (I plan on buying a flex arm for it later or mounting into the side of my computer) anyway I now have an interesting overlay screen that I have a terminal window that I can see thru but look at also to see data or work on it.....Is actually pretty cool I think the controls give me pretty good control over the lcd and even has a clear button that I can hit to see thru the screen without any overlay....maybe I will get a camera for christmas and see if loyd can post some pictures....<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have been playing with my new project all night and part of the morning in case you are wondering the lcd is a sharp QA-50.<br />LCD projector screen which means it does not have a backlight panel you can see thru it. haveing it hang on the monitor does not look so cool but I really think that mounting it on a flex arm would be cool looking. It is neat to be able to have my terminal window open with my cluster monitor running and a little section to run bash scripts while I am running gnome desktop on the monitor. and beable to pull my focus to either or both. I also played with putting some light wire behind it for low backlighting and mounting it to the side of my computer could be used for computer stats or cluster stats or just bring it and a keyboard would not need a moitor for quick work out there. Like the cluster monitor idea maybe I could mount it on goliath my homebrew blade cluster server. Any thoughts<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">My thought is just that you have a lot of run on sentences. I really want to see a picture of this just to get a better idea. I&#039;m not quite grasping the concept.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">here you go the first image is the entire project overview including laptop that I am using for testing and the lcd with control panel.<br />(http://img521.imageshack.us/img521/3181/picture0191ks.th.jpg) (http://img521.imageshack.us/my.php?image=picture0191ks.jpg)<br />The next image is of the LCD by itself notice the nice mounting frame around it.<br />(http://img521.imageshack.us/img521/8237/picture0177xq.th.jpg) (http://img521.imageshack.us/my.php?image=picture0177xq.jpg)<br />Here you can see where I had to remove the 16 conductor flatcable from the electronics and solder 2 8 conductor cables to give me some play with the LCD.<br />(http://img521.imageshack.us/img521/6389/picture0185fc.th.jpg) (http://img521.imageshack.us/my.php?image=picture0185fc.jpg)<br />Here is the final working project right now that is not backlighting you see in the back that is a sheet of paper from my printer. If you look along the top edge of the&nbsp; lcd you can make out the bedspread thru it...That is a ls /etc command from the laptop being displayed.<br />(http://img443.imageshack.us/img443/3644/picture0207cb.th.jpg) (http://img443.imageshack.us/my.php?image=picture0207cb.jpg)<br />I can adjust the contrast and text thickness with the controls on the electronics....the text you see is an ls /etc command run from the laptop.<br />I hope that gives you a better understanding .................................<br />And big thanks to Rugmunster for giving me the image tip.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well to finish this out I have opted to still a backlight unit from an old 486 laptop and placed behind the lcd so now I have a super thin lcd display.<br />Works well in text mode and is great for monitoring the cluster. I have it mounted over my dual heads for just that function.<br />I have also learned how to repair lcd backlighting for laptops in the process and will post an article soon as I am able to finish writing it.<br /></div>
