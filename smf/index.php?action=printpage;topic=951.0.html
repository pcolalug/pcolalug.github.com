					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey all. I'm fairly new to Linux and am currently trying to learn to use Linux Real-Time Operating System in conjunction with JTime, real-time Java for embedded systems. I'm hoping to develop a web-controlled robot that will display streaming video for a school project. The project is well beyond my current abilities but I am hoping to get some good info from groups such as this. If anyone is interested in exchanging ideas on this, let me know. I sure could use the help. <br /><br />Hope to meet some good people at the next group meeting.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I know I won't be able to help with the project in a programming way (I think I have heard of something called Java). But I can say &quot;Welcome.&quot;<br /><br />If there is any hardware you might need for the project, let the group know. We trade stuff around for very reasonable. Usually for another piece of hardware, or just a few bucks.</div>

Also, welcome to the other guys I neglected to welcome. Hopefully, I'll meet you all next year when I come home again! Until that next meeting...</div>
