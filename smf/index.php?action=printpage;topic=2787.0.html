					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Boy was I surprised today.&nbsp; I just installed an Epson Stylus CX3810 (http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/consumer/consDetail.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=yes&amp;oid=56291069) Printer/Scanner.&nbsp; You know what?&nbsp; The printer is working correctly in full color and the scanner works in xsane!&nbsp; I opened up the Add a Printer thing in Gnome, it asked me if I wanted to install it and with a change of paper size, I was rockin&#039;!&nbsp; The only hang up with scanning is that I have to run xsane as root, but otherwise, it works like a champ!&nbsp; Happy happy happy am I!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sounds good, Rug.&nbsp; I&#039;ve not tried to use a scanner in Linux, but is there something like a &quot;/dev/scanner&quot; ?&nbsp; If so, might just need to change the permissions on it to 666 or something, or add your user to a &quot;scanner&quot; group, maybe.<br /><br />I was hoping that device had a parallel interface, but I see it&#039;s only USB.&nbsp; Anyone know of a low-to-medium-grade color inkjet these days with a parallel connector on it?&nbsp; Seems everything now is USB-only.&nbsp; I have a 3-port printserver on my LAN with only parallel connections, and I&#039;d like to replace a recently-deceased HP deskjet that was on it.&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp; A multi-function device would be OK, too...<br /><br />Dan<br /></div>
