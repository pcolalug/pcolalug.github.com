					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Mayhem,<br />Glad to have you. What distro are you running or planning to run? If you are like most of us you will try your hand at all of them before you settle on one. Depends on your needs as to which will best suit you. I think the majority of people with the group have settled on Mandrake (for today anyway).<br /><br />I am running Mandrake 8.1 and 8.2. I like them both, though 8.2 has seemed just a bit nicer. 9 is in beta right now.<br /><br />Most all Linuxes will do what you want. It just depends on how you want to do it as to what distro is best for you.<br /><br />Let us know of any help we might be to you. The next meeting will be this Saturday at Books-A-Million in Pensacola. 6:00 in the back of the store. I won't be there (currently in Pennsylvania) but you will enjoy meeting the group.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">We (the group) recently had a strange install. The 2 or 3 different distros and versions we tried to install would get to a certain point and just hang. What was strange is that it happened on all of our installation attempts. Actually they all seemed to install fine, it was on the initial reboot that it would hang.<br /><br />We finally pulled all the expansion cards (except monitor) and found that it was the sound card that was hanging the machine. You can probably find a cheap supported sound card amongst the group if yours gives you problems.<br /><br />As far as the modem is concerned, just get broadband and forget dial-up. I know not everyone can do that, but I like mine so much that I want to encourage others to get involved. Then all you would have to configure is the NIC, which has been surprisingly easy in Linux for me.<br /><br />Good luck.</div>

It seems to do very well with hardware support. Also, I remember reading something about Linux working on Winmodems now. Check Mandrake 8.2 out. If any distro is going to support your hardware, that one probably will.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi and welcome! &nbsp;Your choice of distro will also depend greatly on what you want the machine to do. &nbsp;Is it just a workstation to play games and surf the internet? &nbsp;Then I would sugguest Lycoris (http://www.lycoris.com) or even the new OEOne (http://www.oeone.com) operating environment. &nbsp;I have begun evaluatiing the latter, and so far, it looks like a great way to &quot;ease&quot; into Linux.<br />If you are looking for an easy way to get into development or some more in-depth networking and have some knowledge of Linux/Unix/BSD, you can't do better than Mandrake (http://www.mandrakesoft.com) (Don't tell SuSE I said that!). &nbsp;SuSE is also *very* user friendly, but I haven't been too keen on some of the things I've been hearing about them lately.<br /><br />Best of luck, hope to see you at the meeting, and let us know if there is any way we can lend a hand!</div>
