					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yup, four months after the delayed 6.06 LTS &quot;Dapper Drake&quot; was released, we have a new release of Ubuntu! <br /><br />Features include:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><li>F-Spot, a photo management tool that enables tagging, photo editing and automatic uploading to on-line web management sites such as Flickr</li><li>GNOME 2.16, which in addition to new features such as enhanced power management, makes the GNOME desktop more secure, faster and more stable</li><li>Upstart, a replacement start-up manager offering a cleaner design, eye-catching effects and a substantially faster boot time</li><li>The latest Firefox web browser, ver 2.0</li><li>Proactive security features, preventing many common security vulnerabilities even before they are discovered</li></ul><br />I&#039;ve been using it for about a week and I like it. Upstart is nice. Faster and cleaner. It uses the standard sysV init scripts, but manages to make them work better. Firefox v2.0 is very nice. I especially like the spell check in text field. Also, the enhanced tabs are nice. So far, the only problem I&#039;ve run into is with Cyrus IMAPd on my server. I had to recompile for BDB 4.4 support. It was compiled against BDB4.3 and linked against BDB4.4. Other than that, I had a very smooth apt-get dist-upgrade. <br /><br />To make things easier, I suggest looking into Automatix (http://www.getautomatix.com/) to get the rest of the stuff that is really missing from the default install of Ubuntu to make your install complete.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve just downloaded and tried xubuntu 6.10 myself...daddy likes&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Firefox 2.0 and the new gaim are here, and both are very nice.&nbsp; Also, one thing I am happy to see, is the fact they replaced xfmedia with gxine.&nbsp; <br /><br />The absolute biggest improvement I&#039;ve seen, is the fact that (thanks to the new init system) it boots in 23 seconds, vs the old 40 seconds.<br /><br />edit<br />&nbsp;*sigh, well gxine sucks as usual (even moreso than on slackware).&nbsp; It seems to be completely broken.&nbsp; Once and for all, i wish a distro would just install regular mplayer or xine by default.&nbsp; There really is no excuse for this politically correct crap when other distributions haven&#039;t even been bothered about it.<br /><br />No biggie though, first thing i did was apt-get mplayer and xmms&nbsp; :)</div>
