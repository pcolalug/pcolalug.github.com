					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I had been experiencing some oddities in slackware lately (most likely from my ivtv capture driver).&nbsp; I decided to go ahead and reinstall slack, but before I did, I wanted to give the new gentoo gtk installer a go.&nbsp; I started at about 10:40, and it was still &#039;installing&#039; at 4:30, though installing wasn&#039;t really the word, there were alot of errors cropping up in the install.&nbsp; My curiosity had long ago given way to boredom.<br /><br />Then I remembered, I had an assignment that I modified but forgot to submit, and it was due at 5pm.&nbsp; Long story short 20 minutes later, I had slackware installed, and configured, and my assignment was safely tucked away in the dropbox.&nbsp; <br /><br />Simply Slackn,<br />Brent</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Considering that this is still in early beta, I wouldn&#039;t be too harsh on it. This is far from a final product. And no one said that a Gentoo install is &quot;quick&quot; or &quot;speedy&quot;.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have noticed that there is no shortcut to a good Gentoo installation, at least not on a fresh configuration. Vida Linux was one such shortcut that failed me. <br /><br />The best way to install Gentoo is to get a good stage 2 or stage 3 (that&#039;s debatable), tweak it to your liking, then tar the whole thing into a backup. Then, if you ever have to re-install Gentoo, just scp the entire tar file to the computer, and unpack it.<br /><br />Even with GRPs, you might be spending several hours to emerge an updated system.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Rather than going through the hassle of taring it all up, look into partimage (http://www.partimage.org/index.en.html). It&#039;s basically like Symantec Ghost.</div>
