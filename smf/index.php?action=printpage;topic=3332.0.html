					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have an HP D5160, and it works pretty well with Linux. However, I have an intermittent recurring problem.<br />Sometimes, it works as expected, but sometimes, it prints the first page of a job as though it were printing across a 4-page square, that is, it prints a quarter of the page at the size of a full page.<br />Does antyone know what causes this? Is there a setting in CUPS I can change or in some config file that will make it not do this?<br />I&#039;ve looked online, but I haven&#039;t found any reference to this problem.<br />I&#039;m upgrading both CUPS (a new version has come out since I last did a repository update) and the HPLIP driver, so that may fix it, but even if that does, I&#039;d still like to know why it happened in the first place.<br />Any ideas?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Do you have the GutenPrint (http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net/) drivers installed? I have a newer HP Photosmart and these drivers took care of me. It has been quite some time since I installed it, so I don&#039;t really remember how, but the documentation was good enough to walk me through it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think the new drivers (and playing around with different driver selections) has fixed it.<br />I think I have a gutenprint package installed, but I could be wrong.<br />It&#039;s hard for me to tell whether the problem was solved, because I don&#039;t really print many things. :-/ Still, I think it is fixed now.<br /><br />ETA: So far, so good. No problems as of 5-30-2008.</div>
