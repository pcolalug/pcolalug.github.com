					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Is that 48k-52k a national average, or for the NWFL area alone? Wages in NWFL are pretty low compared to places like Atlanta, California, Northeast. Of course, those places have a higher cost of living. On the whole NWFL seems to be skewed on the cost of living/wage rate ratio from someone on the outside looking in. Of course, I don&#039;t know what the pay is like in software around there...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Um, no, 38K is way above the &#039;normal&#039; starting salary around here from my experience.&nbsp; My first job started at 30K, and even that is higher than a lot of folks I&#039;ve worked with and spoken to.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure salaries have gone up some over the last few years, but I&#039;ll assure you that the majority of college grads in the Pensacola area (excepting those who co-op into a civil service position) start at or below 30K.&nbsp; The job is going to be working with the Navy Knowledge Online (NKO) group at Saufley Field.&nbsp; Know anyone interested?</div>
