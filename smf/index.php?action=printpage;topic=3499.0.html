					Title: <b>April Meeting location change?</b><br />

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">At the march meeting there was some talk about the April meeting being at a different location. Can anyone verify that and give some details now so that people who plan to attend the meeting get that information so they don&#039;t show up at the wrong place. Why I suggest this is some people may not see the change on the forum if it is announces just a few days before the meeting.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I can verify that there is going to be a location change as the usual location will be unavailable this month.&nbsp; However, I don&#039;t know where it will be.&nbsp; I believe Bhoff suggested a location, but I can&#039;t remember what it was.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">There indeed will be a location change, since Lloyd, our keyholder for our current meeting location, will be out of town.&nbsp; There were a few of offers for meeting locations, I&#039;m following up to see which ones are available.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I got a message from mviron the other day and he said the main venue he was trying to make available was no longer an option. He may have something else though. Or, it could be a good reason to geek out over some pizza somewhere.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I proposed that we move the meeting back another week due to the new Ubanto release (that is, if our Slackware/Debian/other users don&#039;t object).<br /><br />This may also give us more time to find a venue if Lloyd is still out of town.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have to agree with that as I have been unable to get something to break free that we can actually fit in.<br />And if Lee is reading this maybe he will show up for the next meeting.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sounds like we are in agreement. Let&#039;s move the meeting to Thursday the 23rd. I guess that has to work out well for Lloyd. If Lloyd can confirm that is fine we need our secretary to send a message to all users as soon as possible. This has the added benefit of me being home and can attend. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve confirmed that Lloyd will be in town the day that we want to push it to, so we will not be changing venues, only dates.</div>
