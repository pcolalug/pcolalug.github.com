					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">What was your biggest hurdle when first learning Linux?<br /><br />Obviously most of us encounter them regularly, it's part of the learning process. &nbsp;But what stands out as a fundamental annoyance that gave you trouble?<br /><br />For me it was floppy access. &nbsp;Being so used to DOS, pop in a disk, type A:. &nbsp;Copy files to it, take the disk out and everything works. &nbsp;The idea of having to use commands like:<br /><br />mount /dev/fd0H1440 /mnt/floppy -t msdos<br /><br />was tough. &nbsp;Then remembering to:<br /><br />umount /mnt/floppy<br /><br />before removing the disk was easy to forget. &nbsp;(Corrupted a lot of files by pulling out a disk before umounting it). &nbsp;I guess the Mac-style motorized-floppy drive without an actual eject buttom would have been useful to prevent that. &nbsp;Oh well, mounting and unmounting file systems is second nature by now. &nbsp;Next hurdle: making sure not to type 'rm -f *' when I mean to type 'rm -f ~*' to get rid of emacs backup files. &nbsp;Doh! &nbsp;:)<br /><br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">For me it was the file structure. Is it in etc? /usr/etc/ /usr/X11/etc? That was daunting. Plus, I started using OSS with FreeBSD, witch is a bit easier to use and manage, IMHO.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Biggest problem? That would be hard to figure out. I am still having problems with some things, and I have been playing with this stuff for 5 years (or more).<br /><br />I agree mounting was a difficulty for me too, until the GUIs started automagically mounting the media for me. When I have to do it in the command line though, I have to hit the web for instructions on how to do it. Fortunately, I don't do it that often.<br /><br />I get frustrated by the lack of support that some hardware has. That is even becoming an issue in Windows. It irritates me (Windows and Linux) when game developers make their game work for one card, but not others. I have a game right now that I bought and it will not run if you have an ATI card, but with just about any other card you are sure to be able to run it. Their comment in the readme file is that &quot;if you have one of the following cards, there is no workaround to make the game run for you. You will need to upgrade to a different card.&quot; <br /><br />I understand that a game might play better under one card than another, but to completely ignore the other cards is unexcusable. This is a Windows game. Isn't that what DirectX is supposed to help take care of?<br /><br />Anyway, back to Linux. I realize that I do not have the latest and greatest vid card, but I should be able to play some of these games.<br /><br />Winmodems. That is another issue. I understand the problem, but does it cost that much more to include 2 more chips (or whatever the number) onto the card to make is a full hardware modem. On their part, they are probably saving $0.50-$2.00 per modem by making it a winmodem and not a full hardware modem. Why not just spend the extra money?<br /><br />Winprinters as well. Anything in the HP Deskjet 7xx series is considered a winprinter. Why do this?<br /><br />I know, there is supposedly a way to get a winmodem to work in Linux, but until someone gets mine running, I will not believe the support is there. I have spend hours upon hours trying to get that to work. I will retract my frustration if someone wants to prove me wrong.<br /><br />Mouse support. I have had mostly good results with mouses. But it took a while to get one of my wheel mouses to work with all it's functionality and have it also function as a pointing device. For a while, I could have either the wheel working, or have the mouse tracking work.<br /><br />I am sure there are other hardware issues. I also realize that the manufacturers are not supporting Linux. It is up to us to develop drivers for the stuff, but I think more time needs to be devoted to that than what we currently are doing. <br /><br />I know...&quot;become a programmer and you can change all that.&quot; If we want Linux for the masses, then we have to assume that the average user will be just that, a user. We can't all be programmers. Who would get to enjoy your work if we were.<br /><br />Other frustrations/hurdles... Well, I guess I will save something for later. I could go on.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Strange enough, I've found my 'windows-only' hardware is better supported under Linux than Windows, go figure.<br /><br />I have a Motorolla SM56 WinModem (old one), last supported version of windows for it was '98, and even that was horrible, dropped connections, driver lockups. &nbsp;There's a perfectly working linux driver for it (and now, most winmodems) which give me no issues.<br /><br />Also, a Xerox WorkCenter M940 multi-purpose USB printer / scanner / copier. &nbsp;The official word - &quot;This is a windows-only GDI printer.&quot; &nbsp;Fortunately, there's a PCL driver for the DocumentCenter 750 which functions perfectly with this printer. &nbsp;No problems under linux (although in windows, I get a lot of &quot;Lost communication with this device&quot; which requires unplugging the power and USB cable from the unit for 10 seconds then plugging it back in, since it doesn't have a real Power button.)<br /><br />So far I'm having good luck. &nbsp;Although I just put a new computer together with a new 5.1 onboard audio chipset that isn't working for me. &nbsp;From what I've read it works fine with ALSA drivers, so I'll be installing those later.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm sure its been mentioned many times in many other forums, but the pleathora of choices giveth and the pleathora taketh away. The sheer number of programs available with a base install of any distro (Even FreeeBSD!) is somewhat overwhealming. It also took me a while to get used to the way programs are named in *nix. I'd find myself searching directories or menus and clicking on stuff just to find out what the heck it was.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">As mentioned by rburt3, I have problems with the directory structure. Though it was not a newbie problem for me. It only came when I started installing and configuring my Apache, ProFTP, and Post Fix. <br /><br />I was having to walk through configuration routines that I read on the web. The directory structure that they would give for certain config files just did not exist on my computer. I had to learn where Mandrake chose to put those files. If I installed Apache from source, all the files would be as I read on the web, but would not work reliably. If I installed from the Mandrake Package Manager, the program would work, but I did not know where to look to start configuring the thing.<br /><br />Not really a newbie problem for me. But one of my biggest frustrations. I don't think it will ever get any better. <br /><br />David</div>
