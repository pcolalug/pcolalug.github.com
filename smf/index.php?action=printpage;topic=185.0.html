					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Does anyone know how to move the main panel from the top of screen to the bottom? I don't know if it's just a Mandrake thing or not but it seems that the main menu panel is the only one that doesn't have &quot;properties&quot; as an option, so it can't be moved.<br /><br />Steve</div>

I think you can just click on part of it and drag it around. That is the way it works in KDE.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: rburt3</div><div class="quote">Also, is this KDE, Gnome, or some other wm?</div><br />I assumed that it was KDE, since he is running Mandrake.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok guys, use your heads... I posted this one in the &quot;Gnome&quot; discussion forum so I must be talking about Gnome. :D <br /><br />I've tried right clicking, left clicking, banging on the monitor, turning the monitor upside down. Nothing seems to work. The panel, with the drop down menu on the left, the time on the right, etc, is located at the top of the screen. It can't be moved from that position as far as I can tell.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I assume you're talking about the way you have a main menu bar on top and a task bar on the bottom? &nbsp;<br /><br />You'll have to change that in the control panel / configuration. &nbsp;I don't remember exactly where it is in Mandrake's setup. &nbsp;You may be able to change that under themes or something. &nbsp;I don't think you can move that menu bar, but you can turn it off and have the standard all-in-one taskbar / launcher / menu on the bottom (which can be moved wherever you want.) &nbsp;If you can't find it let me know, I'll install mdk in vmware and figure it out.<br /><br />NIck</div>

If you will take the monitor plug in the back of the box and turn it upside down also, then it should feed the video upside down. But the problem would be that the taskbar would be at the bottom of the monitor, but still the top of the viewable screen.<br /><br />Hmmm, tough problem.<br /><br />In other words, I have no idea.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Now that the embarassment is out of the way, Steve, did the right-click preferences work? &nbsp;Isn't there a Desktop setup somewhere. &nbsp;Gosh, its been almost a year since I've used Gnome, and that was on FreeBSD.</div>

There isn't a &quot;preferences&quot; option when you click on that paticular task bar. I looked through all of the Gnome setup utils and couldn't find anything in there for moving that task bar.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just noticed that in imnes' screenshot (http://homeweb.org/~imnes/rh8_ss1.png) the panel is absent. &nbsp;It may be its just cut out, but he seems to be the one to know how to do what you want.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Actually, the main menu panel is a special type of panel. &nbsp;No right-click menu, no resize options, and no move. &nbsp;The panel cannot be moved. &nbsp;You can remove it if you like, but if it is enabled, it is always across the entire top of your screen. &nbsp;Sorry.<br /><br />I'll post back instructions on just removing it once mandrake finishes installing.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay, to get a standard looking setup (with just the menu, taskbar, etc on the bottom of the screen).<br /><br />1. &nbsp;Right-click on the bottom bar, and select &quot;Add to Panel -> Gnome Menu&quot;<br />2. &nbsp;Click & Hold middle mouse button on gnome menu, and move it to the left side of the bottom bar.<br />3. &nbsp;Click & Hold middle button to move task bar on the bottom to the right side.<br />4. &nbsp;Right-click on the bottom bar, and select &quot;Add to Panel -> Accessories -> Clock&quot;<br />5. &nbsp;Click & Hold middle button to move clock to right side.<br />... Keep doing this to add whatever functionality you want to the bottom.<br />6. &nbsp;Then, right click on an empty area of the top menu bar, and select &quot;Delete this Panel&quot; (I think it calls it the panel, but whatever Delete option it is). &nbsp;You will get a warning about loosing all it's settings, just click Okay.<br />7. &nbsp;Logout and make sure to &quot;Save Current Setup&quot;. &nbsp;Now you should be setup as normal.<br /><br />Hope this is helpful to somebody.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sorry, I was giving you the exact things I did you reconfigure mine.<br /><br />To get rid of the menu up top, right click on it somewhere and select &quot;Delete&quot;. &nbsp;It goes away.<br /><br />To get it back, right click on the bottom task bar, select &quot;Add Panel -> Menu Panel&quot;.<br /><br />All the other stuff is just rearranging / customizing the bottom toolbar. &nbsp;It's really pretty straightforward, just right click on the toolbar and add things as you need to your toolbar. &nbsp;I added a gnome menu, and a clock. &nbsp;Then just rearrange them to look how you want. &nbsp;(That's all the mess about clicking and holding the middle mouse button, that's how I move things around on the toolbar).<br /><br />Here's some screenshots to show the difference.<br /><br />Standard Mandrake Gnome Desktop:<br />http://www.homeweb.org/~imnes/gnome2_menu/gnome2_before.png<br /><br />And after customizing like described above:<br />http://www.homeweb.org/~imnes/gnome2_menu/gnome2_after.png<br /><br />Nick<br />imnes@go.com</div>
