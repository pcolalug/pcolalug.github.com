					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Raytheon is hiring!!<br /><br />This is a great opportunity for someone that has the skills, but doesn&#039;t have the job history yet. The position is for an entry level programmer that will be working mainly with Windows 2000/2003 server, ASP, MS SQL 2000, SumTotal 7, and Centra. This is a permanent position that could be the start of a very long career with Raytheon. While the items listed are the immediate needs, this client is very likely to move into the Open Source realm, as we are also developing applications for them that are Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP based, so don&#039;t think you&#039;ll be trapped in the MS world. If you are interested, send your resume to: jesse_t_jarrell@raytheon.com<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Jesse</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">*sigh*<br /><br />Yet another great job opportunity passes me by.<br /><br />This next semester I&#039;m going to have mwf off, so I&#039;ll be looking for a job.&nbsp; It just sucks that the only jobs that I&#039;m &quot;qualified for&quot; (read: I don&#039;t have a degree) are PC tech jobs paying barely above minimum wage.&nbsp; (and I&#039;m lucky to find those)&nbsp; PC techs must be a dime a dozen in pcola, cause that&#039;s how they are treated.<br /><br />I&#039;m still hunting for a good part time job, if anyone has any tips...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">As I&#039;ve said time and again, check with the local ISPs. I worked for the Escambia River Electric Cooperative with their Powernet ISP. They love college students and last I talked to them, they still ran a majority of Linux servers with Cisco networking equipment. Pay isn&#039;t great, but the experience is invaluable and you get to do a lot of stuff. Call Brent Stubstad at (850) 675-4521. Tell him Daniel told you to call. As a disclaimer, I have no idea if they need anyone right now, but it would be worthwhile to talk to them and let them know you are qualified and interested.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Brent, first of all bud, lose the &quot;woe is me&quot; attitude.. mmm kayyy? That&#039;s just my .02. :) Squeajky wheel gets grease, no one wants to be around a complainer.<br /><br />Think of missed opportunities as little gems in your pocket. People and companies and contracts and jobs come, and they go. Evenflow. Equilibrium. Have the faith, that in the end, it all equalizes and works out, as long as you focus on the prize, and never let your resolve waver, even for an instant.<br /><br />Here, have an afro on me. :)&nbsp; O0<br /><br />-A<br /></div>
