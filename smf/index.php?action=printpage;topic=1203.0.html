					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">at the december 20th meeting/LAN, what games will people most likely be up for playing?<br /><br />as far as how the teamplay goes and everything, it's hard to beat America's Army - Special Forces<br /><br />http://www.americasarmy.com/downloads/<br /><br />the game is completely free to download and also if people are willing to play this game on lan at the meeting, I will be glad to bring a copy or 2 of the game install file on a cd for anyone needing to install the game.<br /><br />for playing in multiplayer servers such as the official and leased americas army servers, you need to have passed basic training just to play in the servers...I'm not sure if it's the same for playing on lan servers, but passing basic usually isn't too hard and gives you a basic quick walkthrough of the game and lets you adjust to the controls and get used to the game<br /><br />anyone else other than myself up for playing AA?</div>
