					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">&quot;We have complied and we are willing to do more,&quot; said the company&#039;s lawyer Bradford Smith today. &quot;Interoperability in our industry happens through dialogue and engagement, not through fines.&quot; And while $252 million, as of today&#039;s date, may only scratch Microsoft&#039;s reported $50 billion cash pile, non-financial penalties including more challenges on openness could be just as painful. <br /><br />Although Microsoft has touted a 12,000-page submission and free technical support to its rivals as the answer to the EC&#039;s ruling, the Commission says the hefty manual is still not usable. <br /><br />6 companies to defend Microsoft&#039;s claim that the information is good: The six include EMC, StarBak Communications, Tandberg Television and Network Appliance.  And the other crowd backing the EU claiming that it isn&#039;t useful: Sun Microsystems, IBM, Oracle, and Novell.<br /><br />&nbsp;&quot;Our independent trustee - who is advising the Commission, who was suggested to us by Microsoft - Professor Barrett, has told us that the documentation is, to quote, &#039;totally useless,&#039;&quot;<br /><br />http://www.forbes.com/2006/03/30/microsoft-eu-antitrust-eu_po_0330autofacescan07.html?partner=yahootix<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here is some ramblings of mine to provoke some thought....<br /><br />At some point, Microsoft needs to consider is it even financially feasible to remain in Europe. Does it even clear $2M a day from its EU operations? Possible, but if Microsoft wanted to push a point, they could revoke the EULA for all EU countries, and then let the commission scratch their head and wonder &quot;what do we do now?&quot;. Some may say that this would be great as it would create an opportunity for the open source community, however that would not be the case, because the same documentation requirements would be imposed upon anything that would fill the void, less the EU look like an idiot.<br /><br />I am by no means a Microsoft fan at all, in fact I&#039;m far from it. But look at the precedents this is now creating not only in the OS vendor space, but also how France is looking at imposing requirements to force Apple to allow any content on IPods, and force ITunes to play on competitor devices. Its time governments quit monkeying with the markets and let users decide for themselves instead of being puppets for inept companies that couldn&#039;t program their way out of a wet paper bag. Nothing is stoping these companies from writing their own OS, and in the case of the IPod, there are so many other personal music devices out there, that if consumer X really wanted it in another format, there&#039;s nothing stoping them.<br /><br />To put all this in perspective, lets say you were to create a widget and spent your hard money to patent it, trademark it and market it. It becomes so popular that 90% of all widgets sold were yours. You&#039;ve also created a line of accessories to attach to your widget. XYZ Company now comes forward and complains that you don&#039;t provide the engineering data needed so they can create their own accesories to compete with you. This should get laughed out of court, however if you were to apply what has happened to Microsoft, you would be compelled to provide that data, even though its protected by your patents and is considered a trade secret. Pretty crappy if you ask me, which leads to the inevitable - Why bother creating anything for a profit if the governments of the world are just going take it away from you. The world (including open source companies) work on the principal of making a profit, and snatching the rug from under the innovators of the world by taking away their motive is a scarry thought.<br /><br />Just for grins, apply the above widget example to any open source project. While it may look good on the surface to see them &quot;stick it to Microsoft&quot;, it is only a precursor of what could become a nightmare for the open source community.<br /><br />Any comments? <br /><br />Jesse<br />http://www.hitechwholesale.com</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just out of curiosity, how is this bad for open source software? Everything is open, meaning any one with the know how can look at the code and figure out exactly what&#039;s going on and how to make their own stuff compatible.<br /><br />I see what the EU is trying to do. They are trying to ensure competition continues. Contrary to what most people think, we do not live in a pure capitalistic economy. The US and EU are a <i>mixed</i> economy where the government is involved with the economy, providing oversight and participating in the private side of the economy. If we did have a pure capitalistic society, every single on of us would be in very bad shape. The businesses with the best strategies would form monopolies and make it nearly impossible for any potential competitor to enter the market. If a competitor were to get into the market, the monopolistic company would easily destroy the competitor from it&#039;s unbridled market power. <br /><br />Government oversight isn&#039;t a bad thing when it comes to the economy. I think it&#039;s a good thing that the EU is asking for documentation for systems they rely on. It is also their responsibility, just like it&#039;s the US government&#039;s responsibility, to make sure others can make bid on public projects. They are wanting what the open source world is touting so loudly, freedom of choice. Microsoft has a bad practice of taking standards and changing them in their implementation just enough to make them completely incompatible with other products using that standard, all in the name of customer lock-in. Understandably, they want to be the one stop shop for all government, military, enterprise, small business and home user computing needs, but when they start shutting out the rest of the market on all fronts, especially when they have a near monopoly in the operating system area, I think it&#039;s time for government to step in and re-open the door for competition. <br /><br />Competition benefits us because innovation, lower prices and higher quality come out of it. Why do you think Windows Vista is going to have a 3d capable desktop? Why do you think Xgl and AIGLX have come out? Apple came out with it first to get a one-up on the other OS&#039;s. Now, Microsoft and the open source world are playing catch up and at the same time innovating new technologies to compel users to use their product. If there were only one player in the market, innovation would surely die, and customers would have no alternative. Afterall, the monopoly has kicked everyone else out of the market.<br /><br />On to patents. One of the biggest things that <b>is</b> going to kill innovation is software patents. When you start putting patents on software, you will find less and less open source developers willing to get into the mix for fear of being sued. A friend of mine was talking about some things that he&#039;s had ideas to make. After finding out that his ideas had already been patented only their implementations were slightly different, he contacted a lawyer. He was told that he should go ahead and build his invention and get a really good patent lawyer on his side. Look at the Eolas case against Microsoft. This is one thing I sort of feel bad for MS on. The simple idea of plugins was patented and now we are in a 60 day window to change every MS app that utilizes IE plugins. I don&#039;t really blame Microsoft for that; I blame a broken patent system.<br /><br />That&#039;s my view on it. MS should open up it&#039;s bastardized protocols, or a government should make them and patents in their current implementation are bad.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">How is this bad you ask... Have you ever looked at sad state that most open source project documentation is in? And how many open source project developers would be willing to babysit companies so they could be &quot;competitive&quot;? Yes, the code is out there in the open - but that is not what was asked of Microsoft. The terms you used was &quot;anyone with the know how....&quot;, so does this mean that a Java centric software shop should get special treatment because the original code is in C? Rulings and requirements like this will open the door to this type of stupidity.<br /><br />I agree with you about we live in a mixed economy, otherwise farm, dairy, oil &amp; gas industries would have to charge what it really cost to produce their products (And you thought $3.59 a gallon was high for milk). Oddly, I have no problem with that, as it does have a benefit to all consumers. What I don&#039;t agree with you is your statement &quot;The businesses with the best strategies would form monopolies and make it nearly impossible for any potential competitor to enter the market.&quot;. Short of buying all of your competition, you can&#039;t &quot;form&quot; a monopoly. Does Microsoft have a monopoly? Not at all. Last time I checked RealNetworks and Apple are still their own entities. Is Microsoft guilty of anti-competitive behaviour? Absolutely, as they essentially forced vendors to install their software (and not install their competitions) or be cut out completely. Did Microsoft get put in their place? Yes, as vendors are now willing to provide systems with other OS (such as Dell&#039;s w/RHEL) without fear of retribution from Microsoft. Do I consider &quot;bundling&quot; (including a browser and media player with the OS) a bad thing? Absolutely not, provided it does not prevent me from installing a 3rd party application which last time I checked, Quicktime and Firefox ran just fine even though WMP &amp; IE are installed by default. If it was a bad idea, then why does most linux distributions include Totem &amp; Firefox with the default install? Convenience, and that is what Microsoft is guilty of - making applications convenient. <br /><br />Going back to the monopoly issue, take Linux for example. Linux has thrived and even become a household name AFTER Microsoft was deemed a monopoly (which I don&#039;t believe they are). If what you said was true, then Linux wouldn&#039;t have a chance. However, what has happened is that Linux (when combined with other open source projects such as Apache and MySQL) have been able to prove itself as a better alternative. So far, that is only true in the server realm, as there are way more Linux installs than Windows NT/2000/2003 servers. As Linux on the desktop becomes more mature, and more mainstream apps are either ported to Gnome/KDE, an equal shift in the market share will take place. Companies like Redhat and Novell are working this angle, as the typical cubicle mole only needs a web browser, an email client and an office suite to be productive. Can you say Firefox, Thunderbird &amp; OpenOffice? The best thing that has happened for Linux on the desktop is Vista. I would bet one of the top 3 reasons Vista has been delayed isn&#039;t due to security issues, but the fear that once Vista rolls out and support for XP begins to taper off, companies will then have a REASON to migrate to something other than Microsoft. It almost happened in the transition from 2000 to XP, but Desktop Linux wasn&#039;t mature enough yet. Now that it is, Microsoft has plenty of reason to keep milking the XP cash cow as long as possible.<br /><br />Now take Apple for example - Again another competitor that has been able to make it without having to whine about Microsoft being a monopoly. <br />Granted, I believe they exist strictly for those people who despise Microsoft so much, they are willing to put their money where their mouth is. If more people would do this, Microsoft wouldn&#039;t be able to &quot;bastardize&quot; the protocols as you put it and call it &quot;innovation&quot;. At the end of the day, my point remains there are too many companies that would rather cry foul about not having a &quot;fair market&quot; to work in instead of putting forth the effort to just make a better product.<br /><br /></div>
