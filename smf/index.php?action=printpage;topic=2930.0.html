					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Everyone,<br /><br />I am using an eMAC 1Ghz Power PC. I recently upgraded the OS from Jaguar to Tiger.<br />Currently 640MB RAM - plan on increasing to 1GB.<br /><br />I want to increase the system performance by adding more RAM.<br /><br />I know it takes SD-RAM PC 133... I plan on purchasing it from Newegg. Are there any suggestions according to which I should get... or is the Value RAM going to do fine? <br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />TONY<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Any memory, provided it has a lifetime warranty, will work as long as it meets the specification required by your motherboard. ValueRAM is great memory made by Kingston. Although it may not be the fastest stuff in the world, this shouldn&#039;t be an issue unless you&#039;re trying to make a system with crazy high performance. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yeah... I pretty much figured any ram would work... I was just worried about possible proprietary issues with MAC&#039;s... I already added some ram to the machine... but the ram came directly from apple several years ago... and they just want way to much money... i&#039;m looking into 70 - 80 dollars for another 512MB...<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">As was already pointed out, any RAM that is PC-133 should work fine.&nbsp; I would guess that you won&#039;t see much (any?) performance difference in going from 640Mb to 1Gb...<br /><br />Dan<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m sure he might notice a difference if he had kde, open office, and azureus running all at the same time&nbsp; &gt;:D<br /><br />Also, linux likes to use ram for cache just about everything, so you *might* see speed ups for heavy I/O operations...<br /><br />Personally, I&#039;d like to go all out after I graduate college, and build a new PC.&nbsp; I want a 64bit Processor, so I can use like 2+ gig of ram to it&#039;s fullest.&nbsp; I&#039;d probobly just load the entire OS into ram, and never reboot&nbsp; O0</div>
