					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;d love to see some sample security reviews .. .as in what you would hire a third party to come in and do.&nbsp; Maybe someone talk (if we have anyone doing security audits?) about how that works and what one should expect when hiring a security audit from a third party.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">AWESOME!&nbsp; I&#039;d love to see something on Asterisk.&nbsp; Did you hear about Sam Houston State U?&nbsp; They are dumping a Nortel PBX and Cisco CallManager for Asterisk.<br /><br />http://lwn.net/Articles/199545/<br /><br />I&#039;ve been seriously considering it for additional phones here at our campus.&nbsp; I&#039;ve installed it once or twice and got some softphones functional, but never had any hardware SIP phones to play with.&nbsp; That&#039;s about to change:).&nbsp; Nortel (we have a Nortel VoIP system) has just released SIP phones and we&#039;re getting a batch next month, so if anyone is familiar with Asterisk, anytime between now and the middle of next year would be a prime time for me.<br /><br />It&#039;d also be a great topic for any of us doing consulting and side-work.&nbsp; An Asterisk system can save thousands for customers and still allow for a tidy profit as well.:)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">it would likely be later next year.&nbsp; I&#039;m building a house right now plus I&#039;m short 66% on staffing . ..so my hands are tied as far as &quot;play&quot; time goes.&nbsp; Maybe toward the end of the year:).&nbsp; If any one else is interested or has experience with Asterisk, let me know!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Some of the topics, I would be interested in include:<br /><br />1. Discussions of ways to promote Linux&#039;s use in the business world, both on the server and desktop fronts.<br />2. Installing and running databases, such as MySQL, on Linux.<br />3. Solaris on x86.<br />4. BSD Flavors.<br />5. Java development using the Eclipse IDE.<br />6. Techniques for performing Multi-Media tasks in Linux, including playing various video and music formats including Windows Media, using music composition software, watching TV using a TV card, etc.<br />7. Security related topics.<br /><br />8. One final thought.  This idea would require some funding and promotion to be viable, but here goes:<br />&nbsp;a. Setup and host a server running some version of a popular Linux distro with a nice GUI.<br />&nbsp;b. Install the free version of NX Server.<br />&nbsp;c. People curious about Linux could request a logon and password to the NX Server.<br />&nbsp;d. Next, the person could download and install the free Windows NX Client on their home computer.<br />&nbsp;e. Next, logon to the NX Server and experience Linux.<br />&nbsp;f. Obviously, controls would have to be established to prevent malicious activities.<br /><br />Like many others can probably attest, I always have more interests than time, money, work, school, or the wife permits.<br /></div>
