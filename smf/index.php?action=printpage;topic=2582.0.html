					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi Everybody,<br /><br />I just aquired a lappy. &nbsp;Unfortunately this lappy didn't come with a network card. &nbsp;So, I'm looking for a pcmia wifi network card, that is &quot;known good&quot; with linux. &nbsp;I would highly prefer one that had a input for an external antenna.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Brent</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm using a Netgear WG511T with the Atheros chipset, which works perfectly with Linux. &nbsp;It does not have an external antenna connection, but does seem to have very good range anyway.<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have a Netgear WG511 v2.0 that has a Prism54 chipset; however, later versions of that card, same model number, have different chipsets. I also have a Linksys WPC11 v4 with the Realtek 8180 chipset that works well with the various wireless tools such as Kismet, Airsnort and the like. This card is only 802.11b, but works extremely well for certain uses. There is always the option of NDISWrapper, but I would suggest finding a card that works natively.<br /><br />By the way, I doubt you will find a wireless PCMCIA NIC that was an external antenna that isn't hacked. I have seen reports of folks soldering a pigtail onto a wireless PCMCIA nic, but results are not always good.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I got my &quot;Enterasys Network ROAMABOUT&quot; PCMCIA card from E_bay. It is an Oorinaco Gold Clone that has an antenna connector.. &nbsp;I suggest you Google for compatible cards and then visit E-bay.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Harold</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">:oops: Perhaps I should have prefaced that with saying a <i>modern</i> 802.11g or 802.11a card with and external antenna connector.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><br />Once you find a card and in the market for an antenna cable try<br /><br />www.turnpoint.net/wireless/cantennahowto.html<br />and try the links provided there.<br /><br />My five foot cable, with shipping, was $19.18</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just keep in mind that your cantennas and other home-brew antennas _may_ not permitted by the FCC. Some people interpret them as being illegal, some don&#039;t.&nbsp; Home built devices are allowed, under CFR Title 47, Volume 1,Sec. 15.23.&nbsp; Biggest thing is they don&#039;t want someone throwing random parts together and causing interference to other services using the same band of frequencies, like the Federal Government radiolocation service, or accidentally microwaving their cat! <br /><br />You still have to comply with the power limits, unless you&#039;re a licensed Amateur Radio operator, in which case you can have alot of fun in the first 6 channels. (1.5Kw worth!)<br /><br />--Ian<br /><br />Here is the exact quote from the CFR:<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Sec. 15.23&nbsp; Home-built devices.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; (a) Equipment authorization is not required for devices that are not <br />marketed, are not constructed from a kit, and are built in quantities of <br />five or less for personal use.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; (b) It is recognized that the individual builder of home-built <br />equipment may not possess the means to perform the measurements for <br />determining compliance with the regulations. In this case, the builder <br />is expected to employ good engineering practices to meet the specified <br />technical standards to the greatest extent practicable. The provisions <br />of Sec. 15.5 apply to this equipment.<br /></div></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><br />&nbsp; Good point Ian. Some of the web sites about wifi and modding contain many references to both legal and illegal uses of home made stuff such as external antennas. Be aware and know where you stand before using.<br /><br />&nbsp; Harold</div>
