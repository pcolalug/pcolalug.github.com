					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just a friendly reminder that reviews should be done within a couple (2) weeks of receiving the book. Also, you need to post your review to at least two other sites, as well as this one. Amazon, B&amp;N, and Slashdot all take public reviews. I have to send the reviews back to O'Reilly, as well as where they are posted. We will not request additional review books until all prior reviews are in. So, if you haven't done so, please post outstanding reviews to a couple more sites and pm/email me the URLs so I can accept requests for new review books. Thanks!</div>

That said, I don't think there would be such a thing from O'Reilly. But if there were you would want the truth.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yup. Bad reviews are just as important as good ones, especially when you could save someone $40 they'd have otherwise spent on crap. It also provides valuable feedback to both publisher and author(s) so that the next book can be better.<br /><br /><b>Edit</b> I just re-read your and my posts, and I am officially a boob. My only excuse is its early... :roll:.</div>
