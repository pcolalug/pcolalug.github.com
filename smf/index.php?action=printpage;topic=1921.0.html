					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay, just to recap I've got the following:<br /><br />Slackware 10, stock<br />2.4 kernel<br />Turtle Beach Santa Cruz<br />Gainward 5700FX 256MB (6111 drivers)<br />Athlon 64 2800+<br />1GB of Corsair RAM<br /><br /><br />I managed to get Doom 3 installed (after four years of waiting, YES!) and it plays. &nbsp;However, I don't think I'm quite getting the frames I should be. &nbsp;When it first started up in 640x480 at medium, it was flying. &nbsp;I mean flat-out FLYING! &nbsp;I didn't do a framerate check but it was quick. &nbsp;So I decide to crank up the resolution to 1024x768 at medium 'cause the benches I've seen for the 5700FX 128MB w/1GB RAM and Athlon64 are in the 60fps range.<br /><br />Sh!tcanned. &nbsp;Serious, my frames dropped to the 10~20fps range.<br /><br /><br /><br />With that much memory and that much hardware I should be easily achieving the 35~45fps range, every bench I've seen has said so since in the max resolutions they've got more frames than that. &nbsp;Any idea what's going on, or do I just need to compile my own kernel and pray for optimizations to speed?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hmm, here's a thought. &nbsp;The Athlon64's performance in part comes from Hyper-Threading, right? &nbsp;As far as I'm reading here the 2.4 kernel doesn't support that, that's only in 2.6. &nbsp;Maybe I WOULD see a performance boost in moving over.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay, so NOW I'm worried. &nbsp;Like, REALLY worried. &nbsp;Do you think maybe it's that stock, &quot;bare,&quot; generic kernel that's holding me down? &nbsp;I mean, I was expecting it to fly on medium at 1024x768, every bench I've seen promises quite a few frames in windows and even more in Linux.<br /><br />So! &nbsp;Where should I start in seeing what's the matter? &nbsp;Upgrading the kernel and reinstalling the nVidia driver? &nbsp;If I do that, will it break the driver with the 2.4 kernel in the event that the 2.6 doesn't work and I need to go back?<br /><br /><br />My sound is also very &quot;iffy.&quot; I already posted about not getting it out of four speakers, but even with just two it doesn't seem to work all the time. &nbsp;I've booted up Doom 3 a few times and after my second time it just stopped working entirely. &nbsp;No improvement to the framerate.<br /><br /><br />Any help in tracking down what's wrong with the setup would be greatly appreciated...I don't want to go back and install it on Windows just to get the framerate up (though I'm thinking about it just for testing).<br /><br /><br />Oh, thanks for clearing up &quot;HyperTransport&quot; from &quot;HyperThreading.&quot; Someday I'll keep 'em straight. :wink:</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You know, here's a thought. &nbsp;When I downloaded the drivers I got the &quot;IA32&quot; ones because I figured I'm running 32-bit slack, might as well get 32-bit drivers. &nbsp;Should I instead get IA64 ones or will they be incompatible?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">No you need the 32 bit drivers if you're running 32 bit kernel (I think).<br /><br />Are you on the latest commercial nvidia drivers? &nbsp;Sure you switched from nv to nvidia in your xorg.conf? &nbsp;<br /><br />Start a console window and run glxgears, let it run for 10 seconds or so and get some fps readings from the console. &nbsp;Then maximize the window and let it run for a few more fps counts. &nbsp;What kind of numbers are you seeing at the initial small window size and then maximized?<br /><br />Not sure what else it could be - but Doom3 played crappy (on any decent graphics settings) in Windows XP on my Pentium 4 HT 2.6ghz with 512mb corsair ram, creative labs audigy 2, &nbsp;and an NVidia 5600FX 256mb Ultra. &nbsp;It plays better on my older Athlon XP 1700+ with the same video card, I'm not sure what the problem was, I had lots of issues with different games on that system though.<br /><br />I've sold the P4 system and looking at building my next system now. &nbsp;I was considering the g5 imac but the graphics card on it sucks too bad, and other apple gear is too pricey. &nbsp;I don't know if I want to go Athlon XP or 64, might need to stay XP just for compatibility with games. &nbsp;You guys with the 64 systems keep us posted on compatibility and other issues please.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yeah, I'm using the latest drivers for 32-bit and when I get home I'll run the GLXgears exercise, let you know, but I have a strong suspicion that it's the stock kernel. &nbsp;I'll download 2.6.6 today and compile, see if I can get that working enough so that I can see a performance boost.<br /><br />I'm also going to install Doom 3 on Windows XP on this box so that I can see the performance from that side of the box, see if it's any different.<br /><br />Oh yeah, I DO get the nVidia splash screen and all that just fine.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Oh yeah, when I installed the module it gave me a warning about the &quot;rivafb&quot; module possibly causing conflict. &nbsp;Since everything booted up I passed it off as nothing, but I'm wondering if perhaps that stock kernel is trying to use the rivafb module anyway which could be causing some conflict slowing down the system. &nbsp;I did a search and apparently I'm not the first person this has happened to and we're better off overall with the 6106 drivers.<br /><br /><br />Which reminds me, if I want to install an older nVidia driver, do I just run the program and it automagickally does everything or do I need to manually remove the old driver files an put in the new ones?<br /><br /><br />And I'm assuming you run glxgears with just &quot;foxx@anubis$glxgears?&quot;</div>

Since you get the splash, you're using the NVidia driver for your display. A problem may arise if you configure the fb device to use the riva driver, but fb shouldn't come into play in this case.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: SiliconFOXX</div><div class="quote">Which reminds me, if I want to install an older nVidia driver, do I just run the program and it automagickally does everything or do I need to manually remove the old driver files an put in the new ones?</div><br />The installer will handle everything for you.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: SiliconFOXX</div><div class="quote">And I'm assuming you run glxgears with just &quot;foxx@anubis$glxgears?&quot;</div><br />Yes</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hmm, I've been poking around, even over at www.linuxquestions.org, and the rest of the 'net and it seems this kind of thing is real common lately but there don't seem to be any answers. &nbsp;I was going to say it was distro. + hardware specific but that doesn't quite seem to be the case, though it certainly seems to happen in Slack a lot. &nbsp;Very odd.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Alright, running glxgears. &nbsp;Apparently after I let it &quot;warm up&quot; for a second it caps out at 6630fps by itself. &nbsp;If I do anything else (like this) it tends to go down just a bit. &nbsp;So I suppose this means my OpenGL is working, though that might be a little low.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I wasn't really aware what the current status of 2.6 development was, 2.6.6 was where I last left it. &nbsp;I downloaded the 2.8.0 kernel anyway. &nbsp;If it's got serious issues for my computing then I'll load up a 2.6.7 but I don't normally use java that much. &nbsp;Perhaps the patch caused the java issue?<br /><br />Anyway, just trying to plod through kernel config.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Alright, I'm now running the 2.6.7 kernel okay...after one crash and a confusing usage of the word &quot;root&quot; everything seems to run okay. &nbsp;My Doom 3 perfomance, however, has not improved. &nbsp;I reinstalled the nVidia 6111 drivers to match the new kernel as well.<br /><br /><br />My sound has again mysteriously disappeared. &nbsp;I don't even know where to begin on that one. &nbsp;I dunno, new kernel, latest drivers...maybe I need to try out the 6106 drivers, maybe something got broken.<br /><br />EDIT: &nbsp;Sound is semi-working, check out my post. &nbsp;Now if only I could get KDE to where it won't leave that &quot;bouncing tux&quot; icon in the view which stays in the game.</div>
