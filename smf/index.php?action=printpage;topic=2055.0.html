					Title: <b>BIOS Battery</b><br />

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I seldom hear of anyone having to replace their Motherboard BIOS Battery. Today I had to replace one on one of my computers for the second time in a year and a half, a KT7 motherboard with an Athlon 800 MHZ processor. The symptons were: first the IDE harddrives were not detected on BOOT-UP nor could they be detected when going into the BIOS setup. After several attempts to BOOT, I was not able to enter BIOS Set-up at all. The battery mearured 2.89 volts wereas a new battery measured 3.3 volts. I replaced the battery and all was well. The first time I had to replace the battery, the voltage was down to 2.5 volts. Perhapts I have a controller chip or something similar, beginning to break down. Any thoughts?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Harold</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have had several of the ABit &nbsp;K(T,G,V)7 boards, and can't say I have run into this problem. The only thing that comes to mind though is that I run all of mine 24/7, so I don't rely on the CMOS battery too often.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">yea, i've never really had problems with cmos batterys on machines that stay on 24/7, the only thing i can think of that would possibly be a cause is if the machine wasn't on 24/7 and maybe was shutdown daily.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I believe you're both right. &nbsp;This particular computer is powered down most of the time and I don't leave any computer on all the time. I was raised in the &quot; if you don't need the light, turn it off&quot; world and furgality wins out. People argue the question wether to turn it off or leave it on all the time. It's ingrained in both me and my wife and she reminds me when she sees a computer on and unattended. Oh well, the world changes.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Harold</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It could be the portion of the motherboard that is responsible for recharging that battery is going bad.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well first of all the watch cells you speak of are not rechargable. But they should last 4-5 years without worry. All they do is supply 1.5 volts to a postive pin on the cmos chip to keep your profile .. This to me would suggest a weak short on the board or on the pins of the cmos chip.<br /><br />[edit 2140CST 12/2/2004 by Rugmonster &nbsp;- Deleted double post]</div>
