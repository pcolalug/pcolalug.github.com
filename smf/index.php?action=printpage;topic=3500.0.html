					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m from the Ubuntu Florida LoCo team, and was just wondering if anyone in Pensacola is interested in hosting a release party.<br /><br />As most of you have heard, Jaunty is being release on 4/23, and the LoCo team is hosting (or partnering with local LUGs) parties across most of the state.&nbsp; Pensacola is the notable exception so far.<br /><br />I apologize for not being familiar with the leadership or the structure of the local LUG, but was wondering if there is any interest, locally, in participating.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />dan<br /><br />https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FloridaTeam<br />https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FloridaTeam/Projects/JauntyReleaseParties<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If my calendar is correct then the release date of Jaunty falls 1 week after our scheduled meeting.<br /><br />Due to previous concerns about a location for our next meeting, I propose we postpone our April meeting for the 23rd and have a meeting/release-thing.<br /><br />Venues I am unsure of.&nbsp; Suggestions?&nbsp; Will our normal meeting spot be available that week??</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I will be there as well and think this is a great idea even though I am fixing to go back to slackware as my main distro. I still like the idea and maybe it will draw some newbie types to the meeting.<br /><br />On another note I have installed 3 RH boxes and 5 ubuntu laptops since working with Antler.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">In Tallahassee we are going to have pre-burned CDs.&nbsp; I will have some PCs setup with Ubuntu already installed to demo the OS.&nbsp; At the least I&#039;ll have an Ubuntu install and a Kubuntu install.&nbsp; We may have a few more PCs with an install over Wubi.&nbsp; I am inviting people to bring their laptops and/or PCs and we can help them install, upgrade or fix problems on an existing install.&nbsp; There will be a lot of playing the thing by ear.&nbsp; It is ultimately up to the people putting it on to decide what to do, so just imagine what you think people may find useful.<br /><br />I talked to my brother today and he said he was absolutely interested in bringing his computer.&nbsp; He has a Shuttle small form factor he built and is looking to have y&#039;all help him upgrade it to Jaunty.&nbsp; He says he knows someone in the Pensacola LUG.</div>

We will be glad to help your brother out in any way we can.<br /><br />Let me make it through the weekend and we can start batting around ideas on how to make this a success.<br /><br />Volunteers, speak up with you plan to do to promote this in your school or sphere of influence.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">We had 13 humans at the meeting and 2 ducks last night. I think it went well. We did not have a formal presentation. We simply talked about Ubuntu and some of the recent news that affects OSS.<br /><br />Our meeting was postponed this month because of not being able to use our normal venue. It worked out well in that we could do an Ubuntu release party along with the meeting. As it turned out, our venue was again not available to us, but we were able to use a place just a block away which had a nice outdoor courtyard which allowed us to enjoy the good weather.<br /><br />Here are a few pictures I took from the event.
