In fact, .NET forces you to address the topic since<br />Microsoft has placed security-related features at the core of the .NET<br />Framework. Even so, carelessness and lack of experience can enable a<br />program to be used in an unintended way. This book shows programmers<br />how to use. .NET's various tools to write secure applications.<br />http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/prognetsec/<br /><br />Chapter 4, &quot;The Lifetime of a Secure Application,&quot; is available<br />online: &nbsp;<br />http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/prognetsec/chapter/index.html<br /><br /><br />***Learning UML<br />Order Number: 3447<br />&quot;Learning UML&quot; introduces and leads you toward mastery of the Unified<br />Modeling Language.

To &quot;Go on Safari,&quot; any of your members who sign up<br />for our Safari 14-day free trial can send comments on their<br />experiences, or tips and tricks for how they used Safari (it only<br />needs to be 2 sentences long, but it may be longer) to<br />safari_talk@oreilly.com. &nbsp;<br />(Please include your UG name in the email.)<br /><br />Every week someone will be chosen from the tips or comments submitted<br />to receive fun stuff from O'Reilly (T-shirts, book bags, or other<br />surprises). If a member of your user group is selected, your group<br />receives free gifts, too. Whatever the individual member receives, your<br />UG will get one, too, to give away at your next meeting, or use however<br />you see fit.

In this article, he<br />discusses the use of the NetworkStream class for network communication<br />and how easy it is to use it for socket programming.<br />http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2003/07/07/netstreams.html<br /><br />---------------------<br />XML<br />---------------------<br />***The Document is the Database<br />When we convert to a database-backed web application in order to solve<br />problems of shared editing and presentation-oriented file formats, we<br />trade away the convenience of the file-oriented approach.
