					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have always wondered about the commercial VoIP stuff. We have a VoIP suite that I have been able to play with at work and tie into our telephone switch. It's very cool. Let us know how it works out. That's $25 less than I pay for my unlimited long distance here in OKC.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Have had my Vonage service up since April 04. Some issues w. conference calling early on (Belmont, CA-Vonage : Pensacola, FL-Vonage : Clients in NYC etc-POTS) but since then, it's been smooth sailing!<br />Anywhere within the US &amp; Canada, one flat rate. &nbsp;I also like the vmail to your email address (it's a .wav file). Neat feature.<br /><br />Cox modem port to WAN port on Motorola VoIP adapter, VoIP adpater pc port to pc. RJ-11 phone line to line 1 port on VoIP adapter. Done. VoIP adapter picked up the TCPIP settings, and I assume has some form of DHCP/NAT. No software to load on the PC. Did a test of a FTP of a large file, while chatting on the phone, no degradation of quality, so there must be some sort of QoS running to prioritize the traffic.<br /><br />Was thinking of taking it on the road, to avoid the insane calling fees w. the hotels, but my T-Mobile V300 is just more convenient. :)</div>

Neither could tell I calling though the Net. I think I'm going to stick with this for a while.<br /><br />Oh, and my current provider, who I'm dropping as soon as the local number transfer is complete, just sent me a letter informing me that my rates are going up $10/Month.<br /><br />Aren't they in for a surprise.... :D <br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just found out Cox has a deal for $55/month for 5Mbps/768kbps (currently at 4Mbps/512kbps for $40). I also have unlimited local and long distance for $48.95/month + taxes and fees. If I were to go with VoicePulse, I could get a Milton number (since most of the people who call me are there) and I would still have my cell with an OKC number. For the monthly billing, are there any other charges with VoicePulse on top of the $24.99? The way I see it, I could end up spending ~$10 less each month and having a much more fitting setup for a true geek like myself. I'm just curious what you guys think.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">We are using it now to setup our outdated schoolboard and County offices phone system. PBX style with the new Astrix system. After we work out bugs.<br />So far from there tech support we can bring telco lines in and go out to internet via there software. I will post more here when I can get more deails on the actuall setup from phone to internet. I know that the school wants to be able and send messages out from there call list to email and phones either cell or land line. also the hunt feature is nice had some people come in to the office and demo it for us.[/i]</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for the tip about calling Vonage Steve. I would like to go with them because of having one friend that I would call regularly is on that network. But VoicePulse has the advantage of local calls being unlimited in their $15 / month plan (but limited to just 200 long distance). Since the majority of people that I would call and chat with are in Pensacola, I would be able to do that without being concerned about the 500 minute limitation of Vonage. Both are only 3.9 cents per minute if I go over.<br /><br />What a great deal! Either one of them would be a tremendous savings as I am paying 45 cents a minute for calls back home. Needless to say, I don't make any calls.<br /><br />It is funny to think that this is a hard decision since either of them represent potentially hundreds of dollars worth of savings. Plus it gives me the freedom to call people back home and them to call me without having to go international. I just did not realize that I could use these services from here. Otherwise I would have been looking into this alot sooner.<br /><br />I will still look into Astrisk. But their website is so daunting to read and understand, you would think it was a Linux site. Oh, it is! Hmmm. Maybe we should work on cleaning up this reputation for ugly sites.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have had it for a few days. I went with VoicePulse. The unlimited local calling was just too good to pass up. I have already talked 187 minutes in 4 days with it! And, I have only talked with 3 people at different times. So I might be a little limited with 500 minutes.<br /><br />One of the nice features is that you can turn down the quality settings to use less bandwidth. I am fighting a bandwidth war here and I think I should win today or Monday. I am paying for 192 down and 96 up, but am only getting 19 up. Of course I did not know this until I tried to use my phone and things have not been working as planned. So, I can turn the quality setting down from the normal 64k (each direction) to 32 or 16. I have it set at 16 right now and it is just fine. I can tell a quality difference, but it is not terrible.<br /><br />If I get this worked out to my satisfaction, I should not have any trouble using the web and talking on the phone at the best quality. Right now I am on the lowest quality and cannot even think about touching the web while on the phone. They feel they are obligated to try and get me as close to the 192 as possible (I really only get 154), but have no obligation on the up speed. I have informed them that I disagree. I have talked with three techs before I finally got one to see that that is robbery (and I called it such). He is to have a supervisor call me today.<br /><br />Ever try to argue in your third language? Not easy. And certainly not over the phone. Phone calls are hard to communicate through.<br /><br />Stay tuned...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don't think that is much of an issue at this point Ruggy. (I have a BEFSR41). When I only have 19 up, even if I block off 16 for the phone calling, then that only leaves 3 up for anything else. Not much I can do with that I don't suspect.<br /><br />I will start another thread to discuss this and leave this one with the VoIP stuff alone.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok after Much research you can use Astrix for point to point communications over IP both ends would have to be setup for it or go thru a pay service to access phone lines. Astrix can be used by bussiness to build there own phone system or the home owner to setup there own private system for family communications. It is actually very easy we are n ow using VOIP for all of our &nbsp; office communications and to the owners houses also along with our supplier. we use the pbx software to replace our avaya system. Totally awesome.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">In my research I have found out a few things today. Been a productive day (until I tried to install Mandrake 10.1 and it borked everything, but that is another story. I was down for about 6 hours trying to get it up again). Your milage is likely to vary, but here is what I have found and plan to do.<br /><br />This site has some good general information (http://voip247.com/voip-guide/) about things you can do to help your VoIP. In a nutshell they rant about 2 things. 1. How good Skype is. 2. DSL is generally better for VoIP communications than cable.<br /><br />Point 2 is where you may disagree. But if you read the page and keep an open mind about the fact that the standards you are used to experiencing are not quite the standards here then you would consider alternatives too.<br /><br />The section that starts out &quot;Switch to a better Internet Service Provider if you want better voice quality&quot; is worth reading. It is towards the top, easy to find. At the bottom in the section &quot;Mistakes to avoid&quot; this comment is made. &quot;Getting cable instead of DSL (unless cable is cheaper): In my experience, DSL is much more reliable and gives better VoIP voice quality that cable modem. (Note: This generalization isn't always true, so investigate your ISP on Broadband Reports before making a decision.)&quot;<br /><br />Based on my former research, I like DSL generally better than cable. But when the DSL company that I was using in Pcola got bought out and eventually went under, Cox was there to try. Had real good experience with them, so stayed with cable. When we first got here we had very unreliable phone service (bad news for DSL). Since then I have replaced several phone lines and have waterproofed them because we lost service every time it rained. But, as it has not rained in over 2 months, it is kind of hard to know if my handyman skills were up to the task.<br /><br />I will be signing up for DSL after the weekend and should have a couple of weeks to test out before the next cable bill is due to see which one I stick with.<br /><br />Even with just 19 up I should be able to do a good signal that is only taking 16 when I am not using the net. But even without using the net there are times when the problem (slices of words are just gone) persists. Having run more tests, I am apparently getting better throughput up than the 19, but I am not getting any better phone connection. Further testing at broadbandreports.com show me between 67 and 85 up.<br /><br />If you are interested in &quot;hearing&quot; the problem then PM me and I will either give you my number, or you can give me yours.<br /><br />What I have understood about Asterisk is that they are a VoIP to VoIP solution. They do not have a portal to POTS lines. You still have to have a connection with someone to do that.<br /><br />Stay tuned...<br /><br />Merry Christmas all!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The deal with Asterisk is that it makes a PBX. You can get a POTS interface card to use regular phones with it. If you know phone stuff, think the old Merlin systems. Okay, now you can hook that Asterisk PBX through the internet to a VoIP service provider such as VoicePulse or Vonage. This is how you would get out to the commercial PSTN. The little router box you get for your VoIP box can be replaced with a system running Asterisk provided you are using the correct encapsulation and such to interface with their setup. It all depends on the VoIP provider.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">actually David I was thinking of building one to send to you so we could talk and maybe one for your Dad. Of course you would have to give me updates to issues and such since the company is footing the bill to check out voip over long distance and you are the only person I trust with the equipment that can change a config file when needed.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would not mind testing, but at this point my connection is sketchy and the hardware solution is not even working.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">An update. I have just finished my first month with my new provider. I am using the only DSL provider in the country that I know of. I hope they continue to work. Not too many options.<br /><br />I am buying 256 down. Currently getting between 180 and 195. I have some bad phone lines that I am attributing the loss of speed on. I am working on getting a new line installed from as close to the pole as I can get all the way back to the DSL modem. Right now it is split from a connection that is a split from the connection that splits into the wiring that splits off of the main line coming from the pole. Make sense? Needles to say, I don't have much confidence in it.<br /><br />My ability to talk on the phone has been tremendous! The quality of this connection is amazingly better than the cable provider. Though I was getting about the same speed with cable, apparently the quality was not there.<br /><br />I have talked several hours on the phone. Even had a conversation this weekend that was 2 hours long without any problems. I try to limit my surfing while on the phone to a minimum. Can even play ET while talking. But only briefly. Eventually they start to interfere with one another. Though I have gone around 4 minutes with both of them going before I had to tell the person I was more interested in the game than them so they had to leave (what are brothers for?).<br /><br />My recommendation then would be that if you are having problems with using VoIP and you meet all the requirements for a good connection, then look into another ISP. I have read that, generally, DSL is better for this than cable. I have no numbers really to back it up with, but that has definately been true for me.</div>
