					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you want to order a book from O&#039;Reilly (http://oreilly.com/) to review (which means you get the book for free), please send me a PM with the book title that you want with the ISBN. I need these by the January 29. I will put in the order on the 30th. This way we will have the books at the next meeting.<br /><br />If you are unfamiliar with the program here are the basics (http://www.pcolalug.org/smf/index.php?topic=624.0).<br /><br />You can request 1 book at a time and you must complete the review in a timely manner. If you cannot, or choose not to, then please let us know so we can get the book into the hands of someone who can. Our relationship with O&#039;Reilly depends on us giving them reviews for their books.<br /><br />Do not contact O&#039;Reilly to request books. Your request has to come through the LUG for them to send the books out for free.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I was going to put in the request for books today, but I figure that they won&#039;t start filling the order until Monday. I will give you until Sunday afternoon before I send in the order to O&#039;Reilly. I already have a couple of requests, but the more the merrier.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Search the library forum for the rules on being able to request a book. Basically you have to be a member in good standing and request a book through the group. You also have to write a review of the book here on the forum and one other site. </div>
