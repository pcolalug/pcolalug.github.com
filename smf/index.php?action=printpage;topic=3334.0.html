Sick of Window$, HOWEVER....I do a lot of video editing (Power Director) and can&#039;t get past Frontpage for web design....and of course an Azureus addict.<br /><br />1) Can LINUX help? (I&#039;m d.l Ubuntu now)<br />2) Need suggestions for online colleges / courses<br />3) I noticed there were no meetings posted after March 8, 2008....<br /><br />Thanks..Lee</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi Lee, I use PCLinuxOS and also MythTVOS which is a child project from PCLinuxOS Minime 2008 , both are livecd&#039;s. It and PCLinuxOS have kino in the repositories which I use with mythtvos. It works well as far as I know. It is all that I have used so I can&#039;t make a comparison with anything else. I made a few simple web pages for personel use. I used NVU which was a linspire project that they dropped but has been picked up as KompoZer. I like it. Here is a link http://kompozer.net/ (http://kompozer.net/)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have not done any video editing, but would like to. Thanks for asking the question and thanks for the info crowe.<br /><br />I have used NVU some in the past as an HTML editor. I have more recently been using CMS software such as phpWebSite (http://phpwebsite.appstate.edu), WordPress (http://www.wordpress.org) and others. Therefore, I have not done a lot of HTML recently.<br /><br />Jumping right out of Windows into Linux is hard for some people. Most of us have made a slow transition. Take your time as necessary, but give the tools an honest try.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You might try Quanta (http://quanta.kdewebdev.org/ (http://quanta.kdewebdev.org/)) or bluefish (http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/ (http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/)) for HTML editing.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sorry I can&#039;t suggest an HTML editor (although I guess bluefish is good); I use Tea for all of my Web coding, but I taught myself HTML from various online primers. If you&#039;re interested in learning the markup (It&#039;s more intimidating than difficult, and it&#039;s a lot easier with CSS), I&#039;ll be happy to post links for you to some of the better tutorials.</div>
