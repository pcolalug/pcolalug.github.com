					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have been looking for a good way to access and control a linux box from a linux box. My mother got her first computer at 79. It is a linux box I built running PCLinuxOS. She had never used a computer before but at 81 she is surfing the net on linux and really enjoying it. Her hands don&#039;t always work as she would like them to so I occasionally have to help her. The ability to remotely control her desktop saves me time an travel to and from her house and she gets instant help.<br /><br />I have tried several things. TightVNC, VNC and Krdc. We don&#039;t have static ip addresses and I know I can register with one of those dynamic dns web sites but I chose hamachi to get a static ip address. Hamachi is totally free on linux. She has a dsl modem and I have a cable modem. Her connection is the dsl lite so it is somewhat slow. I found that Krdc is really slow updating her desktop on mine. TightVNC and VNC both are faster and work well except I could not find a way to set the screen resolution on my desktop and I had to scroll around to see all of her desktop.<br /><br />I searched the net and found a much better solution. It is the free edition of NX by Nomachine. The core libraries are GPL&#039;ed as FreeNX. The NX Free Edition comes with deb, rpm and source. I downloaded the rpm&#039;s. There are three components. The client, node, and server. To share your desktop you need all three installed. To log on and control a desktop you only need the client. You need to read the documation to get it configured for controlling a desktop other wise it just logs you into you own session on the computer. The desktop control terminology they use is called shadowing. You need to configure the /usr/NX/etc/server.cfg and the /usr/NX/etc/node.cfg files to get it setup. The reason I like this better than TightVNC and VNC is I can set a custom screen resolution on my desktop so I can view the other desktop in full without scrolling around. NX uses SSH to tunnel the connection between client and server also.<br /><br />If I read it right the server is only supported on unix but you can control a linux box from a windows client as well but why? Anyway check out their site for the documentation and see the other stuff they offer.<br /><br />http://www.nomachine.com/download-package.php?Prod_Id=1083 (http://www.nomachine.com/download-package.php?Prod_Id=1083)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That is great work Ed, and nice to see that there is a easy way to do that especially on older connections.<br /><br />Just to throw it out there you can run an X session via ssh also.....Not sure what the overhead cost would be.<br /><br />How much have you been using it and what is your opinion and what are the pros and cons?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have been dealing with this some myself. I use hamachi and ssh to us CLI, but that does not always get me everything I need. While I have done the VNC solutions, I have not found anything that really works well for me. I will be checking this out.<br /><br />Thanks for sharing.</div>
