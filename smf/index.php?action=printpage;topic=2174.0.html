					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm wondering what sort of interest there is among the group for the Alabama LUGFest on February 19th in Mobile, AL.<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote"><br />Hello from your neighbors at SALUG!<br /><br />The South Alabama Linux Users Group of Mobile is hosting the 3rd annual<br />Alabama LUGFest Feb 19th. &nbsp;Since Pensacola is just a short drive from<br />Mobile, I thought I would extend the invitation to your LUG. &nbsp;It is open<br />to all LUG members and Linux Geeks. &nbsp;We have some awesome guest speakers,<br />including Jon &quot;Maddog&quot; Hall, CEO of Linux International. &nbsp;I encourage you<br />to contact your LUG members and give them the details. &nbsp;If you have any<br />questions, you can email me directly. &nbsp;Our website is up but is still a<br />bit under construction (www.alabamalugfest.org). &nbsp;I hope to see your LUG<br />there!<br /><br />Rick Green<br />Public Relations Officer<br />SALUG, Mobile<br /></div><br /><br />Not yet figured out the best way to get together over there but an idea I had in mind is if there is enough interest, carpool over there and basically have the usual meeting there throughout the day basically. On the site, the price said $10 per person and there is a fairly active schedule throughout the day.<br /><br />I'd appreciate it if you could post if your interested to see what we can plan out.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />p.s. if you'd like to see the schedule, then here is the link:<br />http://www.alabamalugfest.org/sched.php</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Due to the low cost and convenience of day I'd be interested in going. &nbsp;That is of course barring the catastrophic (wife getting shot, car wreck, death in the family, loss of job, etc).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">My interest is high! Of course I cannot go, but the opportunity to meet Jon Hall would be cool. I don't know much about him and would consider him definately in the &quot;zealot&quot; group that was mentioned the other day, but just to say that I met him would be cool.<br /><br />I could add him to my list of stories of famous people I have met. Like the time Newt Gingrich and I were out bike riding together at Calloway Gardens and I almost ran over him. Great stories to tell the grandkids.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">got some details about the lugfest schedule:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote"><br />Hi Lloyd,<br /><br />Great to hear from you! &nbsp;I will try to answer your questions the best I<br />can. &nbsp;I am guessing you read the schedule on the alabamalugfest.org<br />website. &nbsp;The workshops and exhibitions are a time for us to do things<br />besides sit and listen to a lecture. &nbsp;I will be giving a workshop on LTSP,<br />Jerry Carter will be giving a workshop on SAMBA, and Leroy will be giving<br />a presentation to small business owners on the business reasons to switch<br />to Linux. &nbsp;Vendors will be set up in the mezzanine area promoting their<br />stuff. &nbsp;<br />Lugwars is a tradition that dates back to the first Alabama LUGFest. &nbsp;Each<br />LUG gets to choose 4-5 people and 1 leader (usually their pres) to battle<br />other LUGs in computer and general nerdiness trivia. &nbsp;The winning LUG wins<br />the prize (TBA).<br />The VIP dinner with Jon Hall is by reservation. &nbsp;We are still setting this<br />up, and I will make an announcement when it is ready. &nbsp;The website will<br />also have this info, so keep watching it.<br />Sorry, no group discounts. &nbsp;This hotel and the amenities are costing a<br />fortune. &nbsp;We had to have 2 hardware auctions just to get started...<br /><br />-Rick<br /></div></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">We're now two weeks away from this... &nbsp;Haven't seen any further discussion or interest in this event. &nbsp;Is anyone planning to go? &nbsp;Should we be trying to figure out carpool arrangements? &nbsp;I am interested in it, but not sure it's worth the expense/hassle.<br /><br />If we wait until the last minute, things will fall apart...</div>
