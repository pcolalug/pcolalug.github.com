					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Xandros (http://www.xandros.com) is finally out. No free download as yet, so I haven't given it a spin, but check out articles here (http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2002-10-22-014-26-NW-DT-SW), here (http://newsforge.com/newsforge/02/10/21/1749230.shtml?tid=23), and an interview here (http://www.consultingtimes.com/articles/xandros/launch.html).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I was a big Corel Linux fan. I will be interested to see what Xandros has done with the product.<br /><br />I will read these articles with great interest.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, your going to have to fork over $99 to do it. I don't think there are plans for free download editions in the near future. Too bad, 'cause I wanted to give it a spin before I invested. :( Guess I'll continue to give my money to Lycoris (http://www.lycoris.com) (which is now available (http://www.lycoris.com/press/walmartpc.php) pre-installed from Wal-Mart now) when a newb wants a new Linux computer.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Check out Wal-Mart.com's prices. (http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product_listing.gsp?cat=106560&path=0%3A3944%3A3951%3A41937%3A86796%3A106562%3A106560) For just over $200 you can pick up some new hardware. Granted, it is not top the line, but it would probably work great as a file server. Certainly is capable enough to be a web server.<br /><br />Good for Wal-Mart.

I cannot recommend Lycoris enough, here folks. Give it a spin and you will see what I mean. PM me if you want me to cut you a cd of the latest, or you can download iso's here (http://207.251.100.109/download.php?op=viewdownload&amp;cid=8%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The reviews are popping up (don't have links handy at the moment), and seem to be positive overall. Lots of comparisons to Lindows in the reviews I've seen. One was from a newspaper tech section who's author broke his prohibition on covering Linux because this distro (Xandros) was so user-friendly.<br /><br />David, let me know when you get in and we'll do the Pizza Hut lunch.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Has anyone come up with an ISO of Xandros? &nbsp;I'd still like to give it a try but haven't seen a download yet. &nbsp;I don't plan on actually buying it since I don't seem to use a single distro more than a few weeks anyway ;)<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">AFAIK, there will be no iso's from Xandros. They are following the Lindows model here, and if you want to play, you'll have to pay. Too bad, too, as I have been looking forward to this distro for a year, but I don't have the cash to just &quot;check it out&quot;.</div>
