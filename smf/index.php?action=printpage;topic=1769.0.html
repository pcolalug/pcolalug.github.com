					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ive been programming for windows for quite some time now. Mostly VB6 and a whole bunch of webpage development (php,asp,mysql,blah,blah,balh,etc...). &nbsp;Anyways. <br /><br />Im giving c++/c/c(whatever) a spin, in a linux env. <br /><br />The problem is I need some ideas to work off of. &nbsp;I learn a lot from trying it out and learning as I go. Heck I've self taught myself everything I know about computer thingys(with a lot of input from other people of course). &nbsp;So and suggestions or programs someone wants, any linux env language or web based programming. Thow those things my way. &nbsp;No promises, but I hope to learn a lot and accomplish more. Eventully get some programming certificates and move up in thy so called world. <br /><br />Thanks for your time and input<br /><br />c:\<br />c:\windows<br />c:\windows\crash<br />c:\me<br />c:\me\install<br />c:\me\install\AnythingElseThatWorks<br />:twisted:</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">One idea would be to take an Open Source project that's already being written in C(++) and modify it; maybe add some features to it. This gives you the oportunity to learn the flow of the language while contributing to the community. I wouldn't suggest taking on the kernel just yet.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I got K&amp;R's The C Programming Language (http://www.booksamillion.com/ncom/books?id=2897241128647&amp;isbn=0131103628). It has a lot of exercises with each chapter that make good use of the topics covered. The learning curve is a little steep at times, but once you make it through the book, you will have a very good understanding of C. <br /><br />If you want to cheat, or compare your code, there are sites out there with solutions to the exercises. <br /><br />From what I understand, Stroustrup's The C++ Programming Language (http://www.booksamillion.com/ncom/books?id=2897241128647&amp;isbn=0201700735) is supposed to be <b>THE</b> book on C++. I've never read it, but have heard good things from other people. I think it has exercises with each topic, like K&amp;R's.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You could put what you know about web development and tie a client-side C/C++ application into it. &nbsp;Maybe have a web page where users can register things they want to be reminded of, and on their PC they would run your C/C++ app that would check the website every 10 minutes and let them know when an event has occurred. &nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;Thursday 2:30pm - It's time for your meeting with Bill.&quot;<br /><br />If you're really slick you could do the client in java so it would run anywhere. &nbsp;C/C++ is overrated anyway. &nbsp;;)<br /><br />Nick</div>

I have already done this for windows. &nbsp;When I owned an Internet Cafe. I wrote a vb6 app to contol users logon/off time. It inturn comunicated with apache for the user info and logging. Did that so if I would have been able to open multiple store, users could buy time anywhere and use it anywhere</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay - I'm trying to come up with ideas for apps that don't already exist ( or exist but suck to use ). &nbsp; <br /><br />I like the idea of an easy-to-use CD burning app in linux (K3B is good but complex for people that don't need all the power) - the folks at Dropline are working on one that doesn't use cdrecord - don't know the status of it though.<br /><br />How about a home / car / (whatever) buying app? &nbsp;You plug in the details of what you want, it scours the various websites and online classifieds and pulls together all the information into one view?<br /><br />I don't know if this exists, an application that will run on your linux machine, gather all vital system information, config files, running processes, loaded modules, software versions, and combine them into one data file that could be sent to someone else who could view the data for support purposes? &nbsp;We have a command-line version of this from Oracle for systems at work.<br /><br />Okay sorry that's the best I could come up with right now I'll let you know if I think of anything else.<br /><br />Nick</div>
