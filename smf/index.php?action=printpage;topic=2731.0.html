					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It seems yesterday, Linus Torvalds or someone posting as him, posted to the Gnome Usability mailing list (http://mail.gnome.org/archives/usability/2005-December/msg00021.html) saying, and I quote, &quot;I personally just encourage people to switch to KDE.&quot; Later in the thread he posted more. <br /><br />I&#039;m wondering if this really came from Linus Torvalds. If so, then he&#039;s one of the worst trolls I&#039;ve ever seens!<br /><br />Another link *clicka* here (http://lists.osdl.org/pipermail/desktop_architects/2005-December/date.html#390).</div>

Someone said that he should not comment on UI issues since he does not work in that field. My thoughts are that just because he does not work in TV, he should still be able to say which programs he likes to watch.<br /><br />Go Linus!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m thinking this isn&#039;t linus, this is out of character for him.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, linus isn&#039;t afraid to let someone know when he thinks something is a bad idea, (see the cdrecord scsi debate), but he&#039;s usually more diplomatic about things.&nbsp; Also, linus doesn&#039;t use KDE, he uses fvwm.<br /><br />I have to say, although I don&#039;t prefer the desktop, I do like the quality of the applications gnome ships with.<br /><br />I think I might give fvwm a try.&nbsp; I&#039;m plesantly suprised to see it no longer looks like CDE, some of the screen shots actually rival E17.&nbsp; So far fluxbox has been my choice for speed, simplicity and looks, (importance in that order) but who knows?&nbsp; ^-^</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">FVWM still needs lots of raw configuring to look anything like something made in the last ten years. Beware</div>
