					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sorry, didn't see you had an introductions section here.<br /><br />I'm Todd and I'm on Eglin AFB but have been attending UWF for two years and this is my final semester. &nbsp;I'm &quot;trying&quot; to run Fedora Core 1 and have tried a few other distros (Mandrake, Gentoo, Debian, etc) to no avail. &nbsp;Fortunately Fedora has run the best, despite still experiencing some problems.<br /><br />I've had a decent amount of experience with UNIX and perhaps for that reason prefer to run Linux if at all possible. &nbsp;I may not be guru-enough to fix all the issues that crop up during Linux's life but that doesn't stop me from using it more than my WindowsXP box. &nbsp;I just consider it more...entertaining to use Linux.<br /><br />Ideally I'd REALLY like to record my mixes (I'm DJ F.O.X.X. if it matters) on my Linux box instead of my Windows box but haven't had time to play with that. &nbsp;However, it would make things a little easier and more convienient I think since recording more than one minute of WAV audio in Windows is a total pain.<br /><br />I'll probably be asking a ton of questions here so I'm sorry if it becomes annoying. &nbsp;I do appreciate all the assistance given, though. &nbsp;Very, very, VERY much (considering I don't know ANYONE who uses Linux and thus am out of luck when it comes to fixing something).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome to the group, officially. Though we have met through other posts, glad you introduced yourself.<br /><br />I think there was a thread that included some information about DJ software (though the thread was not about that).</div>
