					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I guess I should post this here instead of under my &quot;resume&quot; post. I know its not Pensacola, but they are one year contracts and pay well. They are with ITT systems and they are looking for Network&nbsp; and System Admins, with windozes 2003 server and Xp. We don&#039;t have a lot of stuff to maintain at a remote site. ITT and the Army like certifications so the more the better!&nbsp; &nbsp; Alan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">My boss and I were talking about this eariler today.&nbsp; Except the company with 1 year contracts was CSC.<br /><br />Either way, I&#039;m told that the money is &quot;*very* good and the first $80000 is tax-free.&quot;</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">When I was in Iraq, the contractor that worked in my shop made around $140k a year and I believe $70k or so was tax free. He got two paid trips home a year, lived on the base in military billeting (a tent) and ate at our chow halls. Basically, he had no expenses other than the stuff he bought from the BX or online and had shipped in. He later got a job as a manager for several sites and I heard he had moved up to the $160k range. Oh yeah, he had an associates in something remotely related to IT and I think the only thing he really did during my 4 months there was to reorganize the cabling for our server racks. I got pictures of him sleeping at his computer, which was common. He did jack crap and knew way less than any of us active duty. His purpose was to provide continuity between rotations, but he couldn&#039;t tell you which server did what if you put him in front of a rack.<br /><br />With all that said, there is no amount of money in the world that would make me volunteer to go back there having been through it. I was &quot;inside the wire&quot; away from direct enemy fire. We still got our fair share of indirect fire and having a few mortars or rockets land close to you leaves an impression that takes a long time to go away. My uncle went over there around the same time I was there as an electrical engineer. He came back early due to a heart condition, but he was being escorted from site to site by armed guards, constantly taking fire from snipers.<br /><br />It goes against my better judgment and sense of self preservation. My hats off to the folks that do volunteer, though. I made it out of there the first time and taking steps to ensure I don&#039;t go back again on orders again.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Rugmonster, your right.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;Benefits very with different companies. I had to complete a physical, dental exam, also secret clearance, then a week of Army briefings and more medical stuff at Ft Benning before I went to Kuwait. Then I did a days worth of paperwork in Kuwait city with my company and a week wait for a flight to Bagram. Some people do come over and do nothing and our company doesn&#039;t renew their contracts. I try to stay busy I don&#039;t want to think about home.<br />&nbsp; I figured since this was a year contract some people may be interested if they needed the money / job, that was my case. But remember its at your own risk and it is a war zone. <br />I&#039;m now at a forward operating base, its been quiet so far, I&#039;ve only been out here a month. The other guys said March was last visit by the rocket ferry. <br />If your were in Kuwait or Qatar its safe but they pay is a little less, I&#039;m guessing about 100k, but it is hot beyond belief! I was told its possible to get jobs for spouses also. <br />&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine how the military guys deal with going out and patrolling. I did one convoy and three helicopter flights and that was enough excitement for my life time!!!!<br />&nbsp; I hope this helps....&nbsp; Alan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I spent a week in Bahrain on my way back. I would definitely take a job there. That place is awesome. Expensive as hell (about $3.75 for 1 dinar), but very plush. I also know where that job is likely to be. One of my friends just got back from there.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just a little update...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I think there are going to be a bunch of openings (60) coming up this spring. I believe a mixture of stuff, Net admins, windozes admins, IGX phones, maybe satcom, and some other comms related. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The Army now wants certs, they are pushing everyone now to get them. <br />I have been on site now six months, only four rockets have hit in or close to the base.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Alan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">only 4? thats so few...ROCKETS&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Anyway where do we sign up? They have to have cirts? CSC contacted me. I would go in a heart beat. No joke.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have certs per say, but I have much experience and knowledge as I have been a network/IT manager for 2 years. Come on, thats enough right???</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Oneadvent<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Incoming fire depends where you are at and is subject to change!!! Spring time is here and they have ramped up a lot in the last week or two. Check the news, Kandahar has been hit hard lately.<br />&nbsp; The cert requirements are from the customer not the company. If you want Net Admin, I think they want Network+ and or CCNA. System Admin is&nbsp; MCSE not sure what else.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;There are other jobs in other countries, you could get hired on get certified and see if they will move you. Our site lead was a generator mechanic and is now System Admin. Avoid KBR at all costs. There are a lot of companies over here. <br />&nbsp;It seems hard to find people to come over. I believe that most people in jobs are afraid to loose them. They would come over here make a lot of money then go home and be unemployed. I have bills to pay so I do whatever I need to do to get it done. Keep applying and never give up.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">They just hired a bunch of people, no one stays long here though. I&#039;ll be coming home next June, two years is enough to be away from family.<br />I hope&nbsp; the economy will improve by then. When the economy was good it was hard to find work. Its been quiet here for a long time so we&#039;re overdue for a visit from the rocket ferry. They do need other people like Helpdesk and OSP, just look on the web site. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just a little update....&nbsp; &nbsp;I took five months off and just went back to work two months ago. Afghanistan is building up and there is a lot of hiring going on now. I went to work for a small company that subcontracted to CACI for alot more than I made before. I think a lot of jobs are posted on militaryhire.com<br />Any questions just PM me.</div>
