					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here is a short list of commands that might be useful to newbies. Many of these I have seen come up in advanced conversations. But I thought I would pass the article along.<br /><br />http://enterprise.linux.com/enterprise/06/02/17/153239.shtml?tid=129</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Filelight is very cool. I installed it on my system over lunch and found stuff I forgot I had that was taking up tons of needed space. I&#039;ll definitely be going through and evaluating my storage space now. Thanks, dpeach!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I did the same thing. Installed it and not only found what was eating up my drive, but found whole partitions that I have forgotten about. I think I will be able to free up something like 60GB!<br /><br />One thing I noticed is that my mail is taking up way more room than I had imagined it would. Over 500 MB of old mail lying around. Time to do some spring cleaning.</div>
