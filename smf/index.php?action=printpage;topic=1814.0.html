					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sorry I'm a little late with this, but its time again to nominate next years Steering Committee. Please post your nominations in this thread. Be sure to include name and/or forum name and the position you wish to nominate this person for. If you have multiple nominations, please include them in a single post. <br /><br />You must be present at the September meeting to vote, but you don't have to be there to win. <br /><br />The Steering Committee is a core group of members who are responsible for the day-to-day running of P'cola LUG. The positions are: <br /><br />1. President - responsible for inter-organizational contacts, organizing events, and presides over meetings. <br /><br />2. Vice President - primary assistant to the President and responsible for President's duties, should the President be unavailable. <br /><br />3. Secretary - responsible for intra-organizational communication, posting meeting notes and announcements. Also responsible for forwarding/replying to email sent to info@pcolalug.org <br /><br />4. Librarian - responsible for the P'cola LUG library administration, review books ordering and distribution, and primary contact for O'Reilly. <br /><br />Two other positions, Web-master and Web-admin are also part of the committee and are appointed by same. These folks are responsible for the maintenance of our website and hardware assets respectively. Currently, newton is our web-master and steve is our admin. Also, should no-one be nominated/elected to the position of Librarian, this position may also be appointed. <br /><br />If you are nominated, please carefully consider your acceptance. These positions take some time commitment on your part. Its not much, really, but please consider your other obligations. Talk to some of the current and/or former committee members if you have specific questions.<br /><br />Once you have decided to accept or decline the nomination, please post a reply in this thread.<br /><br />Nominations will be accepted until the 1st of September. We will vote as a group at the September meeting. The new committee should have all appointed positions filled and officially assume its duties on October 1st.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Reading back over the by-laws, its not made clear which positions are elected and which ones are appointed (it also states that I made this post a month early :roll:). IIRC, the positions of Webmaster, Admin, and Librarian are appointed by the Committee, while President, Vice-President, and Secretary are elected by the general membership. If, however, someone wants to volunteer or nominate someone for any of these positions, I think that would be ok too.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The election is now about 3 weeks away... &nbsp;I'd like to see some responses from the persons nominated so far, so we all know if they are willing to run for the positions. &nbsp;That way there will be time to consider alternatives if some nominations are declined...<br /><br />So, what say you, nominees?<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok, I've thought about this enough, I guess. First of all, thanks to everyone who has nominated me for president. I'm honored that you have that kind of faith in me.<br /><br />With that said, I feel I cannot accept a nomination to the Steering Committee this year. I have been in the committee for the last two years and its time to take a year or so off. I haven't always been the best leader over the years, and I fear that extra pressures on my time would only exacerbate the problem. This group deserves someone who can devote more time than I can at this point. Besides, I think its high time the group's leadership get some new blood. With that said, here are my nominations for next year's committee:<br /><br />President: danc<br />Vice President: scottstancil<br />Secretary/Web Master: cntlz<br />Librarian: lloydr/mitchr</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok, I have been nominated twice for VP and I appreciate it; however, I must decline this year. &nbsp;Tomorrow, I start my final semester of graduate school adding an extra class to finish early while starting a consultancy business this coming quarter (stancilconsulting.com isn't up quite yet).<br /><br />If this was four months from now, I would happily donate my time to the group, but I have to think realistically and this isn't my time.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Scott Stancil<br />sstancil@geekrooms.com</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I must also decline my nomination, although I am grateful for the thought. &nbsp;My reasons are much the same: &nbsp;taking college classes at night, in the process of building a house, and kid's activities. &nbsp;I would expect to have a different outlook on things in a year. &nbsp;Thanks.<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">OK, It may be time to get an idea of who'd be willing to take the &quot;Bull By the Horns&quot; an accept nominations. Just like our Democracy works. I'd like to see a list of who'd like to be President, Vice President, etc. <br /><br />Don't be shy. <br /><br />If you'd like to make a difference in the Linux community here in Pensacola over the next year by holding one of the prestigious offices in the group, speak up.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'll make it a bit easier. I will nominate a few to different positions and let them speak their mind. Or if anyone else wants to jump in then let us know what you are willing to do.<br /><br />President: cntlz, crowe, bhoff, mitch, imnes<br />Vice: newton, cntlz, crowe, bhoff, hightechwizard, lloyd, mitch, imnes<br />Secretary: newton, cntlz, crowe, hightechwizard, lloyd, mitch, imnes, woodyharold (bhoff can't write)<br />Library: mitch, lloyd, newton, imnes<br />Webmaster: imnes, newton, hightechwizard<br /><br />I don't want to &quot;cheapen&quot; the nomination system, but I could support any of these people in these positions. Surely I could support someone else if you are willing to step up to the plate. Let us know what you think.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm not too concerned. I think with the quality of guys we have in here, even if people have to do a half hearted effort while balancing the rest of their lives, we are better off than many groups.<br /><br />We are doing fine, we just have to make a decision in about 3 weeks, so we need to get moving on this.</div>
