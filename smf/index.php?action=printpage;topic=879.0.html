					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok, posting here because I don't feel like being rational or civil. Just after the wonderful announcement of the Mozilla Foundation today, AOL lets all of the Gecko (Mozilla et al's rendering engine) hackers go. Sure, some say there were more volenteer hackers than AOL hackers, but AOL's plan had finally run its course, and frankly, it stinks. The plan:<br />1. Buy browser technology with growing user-base and a workforce thats largly free<br />2. Make noises like you're going to drop IE as the basis for your own browser offering<br />3. Score seemingly shweet concessions from Microsoft, even though they just stated that they aren't supporting any more stand-alone browsers after IE6 SP2 (or whatever). Gee, great move morons. MSN competeing directly with you, feature for FEREEKING FEATURE, and you think you're going to score a deal. Unbeleavable.<br />4. Fire everyone who helped advance browser technology (Mozilla is an <b><i>application development environment</i></b>, for chrissakes!) and settle for soon-to-be-unsupported, second-rate, non-standard C-R-A-P!<br /><br />There won't be any profit to this plan though. AOL is hemoraging subscribers and can't fathom the fact that THE WEB IS NOW A COMMODOTY! What &quot;value&quot; can AOL add now that most modest ISP can't? Spam blocking? Got it. Parental Controls? That would be me and my wife.<br /><br />BAH! As if anyone needed another reason to hate AOL...</div>
