					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">At December's meeting I ask about media player and plug ins. I tried all the recommendations and got them all going. For browsing with Galeon I installed mplayer and mplayerplug-in. I had a little trouble getting it to play web files but &nbsp;I had to update to version .95 or higher and it works fine but I still need to tune it some. Mplayer, Totem and Xine all play encrypted DVD's (That's most normal dvd's if you don't know what encrypted is) but I am using xine because it seems to have the best picture and bigger also. I run mandrake and there is a site for getting the players geared towards mandrake that plays the encrypted stuff. The site is PLF - Penguin Liberation Front. You can add it to your media sources in the mandrake control center and when you go to install a player say mplayer it will go to their site and install all the necessary files (win32 codecs etc) except I had to go to cooker to get the updated version of mplayerplug-in. All in all I am well pleased with Linux multimedia in Mandrake 9.2.<br />http://plf.zarb.org/</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ed,<br />Glad to hear you got some multimedia going! &nbsp;I haven't tried mplayer, but do like xine and totem. &nbsp;The PLF site has been handy for me also, and is in my urpmi sources. &nbsp;Another nice one you should check out for Mdk 9.2 is the NORLUG site, here:<br /><br />http://norlug.org/~chipster/rpm_index.pxml?cat=4<br /><br />Some good stuff there, and you can get on his mailing list to receive email announcements when he puts out a new package. &nbsp;Very updated stuff.<br /><br />Happy Holidays!<br /><br />Dan</div>
