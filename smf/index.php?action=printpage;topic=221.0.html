					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey guys,<br />I just saw a flyer at UWF and I came and immediately joined. &nbsp;I have been interested in Linux for years but never could get around to learning it... until a few months ago. &nbsp;I work for a local pre press shop and we recently switched to Macintosh computers from PCs. &nbsp;We needed a reliable way to share files so I convinced the powers that be that we should setup a server running linux because of it's stability, security and ability to interact with so many platforms. &nbsp;I am now running Redhat 7.3 on a 1.4 GHz celeron with 512 MB RAM and 60 GB HD. &nbsp;It's not a dream machine but it gets the job done and keeps the boss happy. &nbsp;I learn a little more everyday about Linux, Samba and Netatalk and I am looking forward to learning more from you guys.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, shall I say it again? Welcome.<br /><br />Can't you see we are starved for new people to talk with? Everyone falling over themselves to say &quot;Hi.&quot;<br /><br />We are glad to have you. Keep an eye on the main page and you will stay up to date with the meetings. Look forward to meeting you in person. Until then, please jump right in to the forums, you have less than 900 posts to get caught up on. So you should be up to speed in a day or two.<br /><br />David<br />VP</div>
