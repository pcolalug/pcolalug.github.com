								<div class="post">Hi imnes and Rugmonster,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; This is a very complex issue and I'm certainly no expert. &nbsp;As I understand it, the short answer seems to be: &nbsp;amd64 machines will run either 32 bit or 64 bit code . . . if they are in that particular mode. &nbsp;The critical issue seems to be with things like pointers, default word lengths and the like. &nbsp;Obviously, if your pointer suddenly has 32 extra low-order bits it isn't going to be pointing anywhere near where you want it to.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So, if you are cruising along in 64 bit mode and you want to run a 32 bit binary you have to switch modes . . . which probably means pushing everything on a stack somewhere, switching modes, poping things back and continuing on. &nbsp;I'm just guessing here, of course, but there has to be some mechanism to make the transition. &nbsp;You also need to be using the appropriate libraries, so these need to be pointed to appropriately. &nbsp;Obviously this can be done, but some effort has to be made to do it. &nbsp;Which is to say, you can't just throw some arbitrary binary at it with out providing for it in advance.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which is one of the main reasons I wanted to go with Gentoo. &nbsp;It would seem that you could simply compile all your source code in 64 bit mode and away you go . . . and in many cases this is true. &nbsp;On the other hand, in many cases it is not true as well. &nbsp; I've been following the amd64 forum on Gentoo.org for months now and the general impression I get (and some folk have stated) is that if you need to get serious work done stick to 32 bit for a while longer. &nbsp;Even relatively simple programs like GRUB have to be used as a 32 bit binary, it won't compile in 64 bit mode. &nbsp;GRUB doesn't matter, of course, because you haven't actually begun anything when you use it, but the same is true of Open Office and several others. &nbsp;Vmware apparently remains too flakey to be useful, for another example.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some people are reporting smooth working systems under 64 bit (Gentoo), but they are invariably far more experienced than me! &nbsp;And I have to admit that the solutions and &quot;workarounds&quot; that some of the folks on the Gentoo forum have come up with are nothing less than astounding! &nbsp;I can't understand most of them even after they are presented to me in words of less than 4 letters!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All of which is NOT a reason to forgoe a 64 bit system of some sort. &nbsp;I have no doubt at all that all of this will get sorted out eventually . . . it is just a very nasty and horribly complicated problem. &nbsp;AND the 64 bit processors are really, really fast in both 64 bit and 32 bit modes! &nbsp;I did do a complete stage 1 Gentoo install before deciding to give it up for a while, and my dual 2GHz Opteron system can compile the entire kernel in less than 90 seconds, for example. &nbsp;The entire stage 1 install took about 3 hours, and a good deal of that was spent downloading source code and portage scripts from Cox cable.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Gentoo amd64 forum is very helpful, and I would strongly recommend you go snoop around there to see what is happening. &nbsp;People are extremely good about answering questions (as here!) and the 32 v 64 bit question comes up fairly often.</div>

								<div class="post">Thanks imnes,<br /><br />Had to do a little actual work this morning (the bane of the computering classes) so I'm a little tardy in replying. &nbsp;Sorry!<br /><br />The Zend program has a 30 day trial, and I found another similar one called NuSphere PHPed which also sounds good with a 30 day trial. &nbsp;The NuSphere program can also manage the database from within the IDE, so that sounds good to me. &nbsp;Anyway, because of the time limitations I think that I had better get my database in order before installing either of them so I have something &nbsp;to work with. &nbsp;I've just downloaded MySQL and an old copy of MySQL Front so I'm going to install them and get to work. &nbsp;I'm looking at several days of data-entry tedium here *sigh*.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I fear that I either have to install a 32 bit version of some *unix (so it actually works with everything) or revert back to windows temporarily. &nbsp;I've set up my system to dual-boot on win 2K, and I've ordered the CDs for OpenBSD 3.6 (which is advertised as working with amd64, smp, etc . . .) so I think I'm going to stall a couple of months until the BSD disks show up. &nbsp;In the meanwhile I'll keep playing with SuSE . . . now that I know how to get OUT of KDE. &nbsp; <br /><br />I really like the idea behind OpenBSD (no extras, just security and stability), and if I can make it work for me at all that may be the way for me to go. &nbsp;I understand that the tradeoff is not being able to implement all the &quot;bells and whistles&quot; but I still think that I will be able to do enough with it to be very happy. &nbsp;Especially if I can eventually bottle up windows in vmware and lose the dual-boot. &nbsp;I really hate the way windows calls home all the time and who knows what else. &nbsp;As it is, I just don't give it network access. &nbsp;SuSE works fine for that. &nbsp;(I also think that SuSE is going to be fine for my wife . . . she will never figure out how to log in as root and truly screw things up . . .)<br /><br />Thanks again for all your help. &nbsp;I'll see you at the next meeting!<br /><br />Bill</div>

Rburt3, your comment about being &quot;a KDE man&quot; with SuSE is so true . . it took me forever to figure out how to get OUT of KDE and to the command line. &nbsp;I hate to RTFM . . .<br /><br />Anyway, Quanta was in YAST and I have it installed! &nbsp;I think that VIM is as well, but I'm going to give this one a try first because I need all the help I can get! &nbsp;I have played with VIM before (in windows) and it is certainly a good editor. &nbsp;My problem is a serious case of laziness and too much to do.<br /><br />A year or two ago I found a &quot;package&quot; that had Apache, PHP and MySQL in it set up to run on windows. &nbsp;I played with that a little then got sidetracked, but I can see that they are all excellent. &nbsp;So, now I'm going to see if I can get something serious together with them. &nbsp;It may be that doing this and trying to learn Linux all at once is a setup for failure, but it won't be the first time. &nbsp;The skin just gets thicker.<br /><br />Thanks again for your help! &nbsp;I'll see ya in a couple of weeks. &nbsp;Well, maybe not you, Rugmonster, unless you come back for another visit!<br /><br />Bill</div>

								<div class="post">Hi everybody,<br /><br />I've been to a couple of the Pcolalug meetings now, so some of you would probably recognize me if we were to run into each other. &nbsp;I'm a tall, old guy with a Grey beard and a growing pot-belly. &nbsp;Typical geek, I suppose, except maybe for the old part. &nbsp;And the Grey beard.<br /><br />I started coming to the meetings because I'm determined to shake loose from Windows and I know absolutely nothing about Linux, or anyway I didn't a few months ago. &nbsp;I think I <i>am</i> slowly learning.<br /><br />I usually upgrade my hardware every 5 or 6 years, and I have been using an old 400 MHz Pentium machine for that long at least. &nbsp;So, about six months ago I started gathering the parts to put together a state-of-the-art machine. &nbsp;(State-of-the-art for all of a few days, I know.) &nbsp;I bought a Tyan K8W dual Opteron board, and two 246 cpus for it, with 4 Gigs of on-board ECC memory, and a 6 drive SCSI array controlled with a LSI Megaraid dual controller. &nbsp;I have learned in the past that disk access is a major speed bottleneck and I wanted to implement a raid 5-0 setup, which I did. &nbsp;Then I built the box to put it all in (all 1/4 inch or heaver aluminum plate) with water cooling, back-lit flow meters, CD/DVD burner, etc, and LOTS of pretty blinking lights. &nbsp;I can't lift the thing, but hey, it was never intended as a laptop! &nbsp;Now all it needs is SOFTWARE. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the AMD64 software from everyone is just a little flaky. &nbsp;Actually, it's all a LOT flaky. &nbsp;It is a horribly complex problem, I know, but it will get there eventually. &nbsp;Meanwhile, this is my at-work workstation. &nbsp;I'll just dual-boot for the duration.<br /><br />Work is a tiny little research laboratory here in P'cola called Poiesis Research, Inc. &nbsp;I started this business in '91 after working as a Research Scientist for the Navy at the Navy Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory for several years. &nbsp;I love the independence of “doing my own thing” and would never go back to working for someone else as long as I can keep eating. &nbsp;Pot-bellies require regular maintenance, you know. &nbsp;(The maintenance material of choice is, of course, BEER.) &nbsp;My research emphasis has been on passive hearing protection, but I've also developed things as diverse as new production technologies for high-strength composites, a nice robot arm with true spherical joints, and even a compound bow.<br /><br />I <i>have </i>managed to get SuSE 9.1 up on my machine with SMP and AMD64, and even though I like the idea of Gentoo much more . . . at least I can get this to work! &nbsp;I also want to try OpenBSD when their 3.6 release comes out. &nbsp;I've already ordered the CDs!<br /><br />I'll see you all at the next meeting!<br /><br />Bill Cushman</div>

								<div class="post">Thanks David!<br /><br />That looks exactly like what I was looking for!<br /><br />Now all I have to do is get it to work with SuSE 64bit . . . and I'm not having a lot of luck with that. &nbsp;I could go back to 32bit and everything would work fine I'm sure, but I'm playing.<br /><br />I'm not picky at all with my code . . . I'll do anything I have to to get it to work. &nbsp;I've even been so desperate that I've used windows . . . <br /><br />But after years of windows sin and degradation, now I'm trying to reform and follow the 12 steps to windows abstinence. &nbsp;By which I mean I'm trying to transfer everything I do to Linux from Windows 2K. &nbsp;I won't be able to do it all for quite some time, I know, but I suspect that it's a “pay now, or pay more later” situation. &nbsp;I tried Gentoo 64 bit first, but I got my hand bit at every turn. &nbsp;SuSE at least runs for a newbie like me. &nbsp;This is incredibly complex stuff.<br /><br />The web page I am contemplating is also fairly complex, and will involve MySQL and PHP fairly extensively . . . which is why I wanted all the help I can get with the software!<br /><br />Thanks again for your help. &nbsp;I didn't know there was a “Intro” area . . . I'll go there now.<br /><br />Bill</div>
