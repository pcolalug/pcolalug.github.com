					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I used vonage for about a year about a year and a half back and loved it. There is no pitfall to 911. You register your address with them and you have full 911 service. There was no lag and voice quality was better than typical land lines. The only thing I would suggest is if your router supports QoS (Quality of Service) then give SIP higher priority over other protocols. When I was running downloads, I would notice some packet loss until I gave SIP higher priority. As long as they have a local number for you, then it&#039;s a good buy. The only reason I don&#039;t have it anymore is because they don&#039;t have any local Montgomery numbers.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Get a WRT54G and up a third party firmware on it. You&#039;ll have QoS available then. If you don&#039;t already have a WRT54G, make sure you get the version that runs linux. If it&#039;s a new one, they are the WRT54GL (http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16833124190). They cost more, but the regular WRT54G that you&#039;ll find retail runs something else and can&#039;t be upgraded with a third party firmware.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">When I last checked into Vonage (http://vonage.com) (2 years ago) they did not have a local P&#039;cola number. Therefore I went with VoicePulse (http://www.voicepulse.com). They are basically the same service.<br /><br />Depending on the plan you get, there is one caution with Vonage. I assume you would get the $25 plan. But, if you go with the $15 plan, be aware that the 500 minutes you get are local and long distance. It is assumed by many that the local is unlimited and long distance is limited to 500. Not true.<br /><br />With VoicePulse you only get 200 long distance minutes for the $15 plan, but you get unlimited local. Local being the whole of area codes 850, 352 and 386. That is Pensacola, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, Ocala and Gainsville. All local.<br /><br />If you go up to the $25 plan on both of these, then that point becomes moot. If you get into the higher plans with Vonage, there are more benefits than with VoicePulse. <br /><br />VoicePulse also allows you to adjust the quality of your calls so that you can use less bandwidth when needed. I am not sure if Vonage allows that or not. For those of us who only have 512/128 (at best) connections, this can be a help.<br /><br />Hope that helps. I would highly recommend it. I live in Mexico but have a local Pensacola number and can talk to my parents as if they lived across town.</div>
