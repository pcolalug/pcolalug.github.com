					Title: <b>Tabbed Browsing in Mozilla</b><br />
					Post by: <b>dpeach</b> on <b>September 02, 2002, 09:57:11 am</b>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">(This appeared in a newsletter article, but I thought since we have some new folks to the group, I would reprint it here.)<br /><br />Tabbed browsing is a feature in Mozilla that allows you to open several pages in one browser window instead of opening several windows for a group of pages. The effect is that you have one window open with manilla folder style tabs at the top of the page. If you have Mozilla 1.0 (or newer) there is a really neat feature that you can use all these open tabs for, but more on that later. <br /><br />The easiest way to use tabbed browsing is to simply right click the link and choose “Open in new tab.”<br /><br />For more advanced features of tabbed browsing go to Edit | Preferences on the menu bar. Click the “Navigator” tab then “Tabbed Browsing”<br /><br />I &nbsp;like to have it load the new tab in the background. This will allow the page to load while you continue to read the current page. When the tabbed page finishes loading you can click the tab to read the new page. To do this you need to select “Load links in the background.”<br /><br />Another way to open tabs without right-clicking is to select “Middle-click or control-click of links in a Web page” in the preferences area. This is the way I prefer to open tabs. This allows you to hold the control button and left click the link. If you have a middle button (or have set your mouse up to use chorded clicks) then you can middle click and have it open in a new tab.<br /><br />The new feature in 1.0 is being able to bookmark all of your open tabs under one bookmark. Select Bookmarks and then File Bookmark. When you save the bookmark select the checkbox “File as group” which will allow you to save all the open tabs as one bookmark. When you are doing research on a particular subject, you will be able to save all that information as one bookmark.<br /><br />I have not used bookmarks in years, since the advent of good quick search engines (i.e.: www.google.com (http://www.google.com)). But the ability to save several pages under one bookmark may make me change my mind on that subject.</div>
