					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hoary is final and released today. &nbsp;Installed and running here on my laptop. &nbsp;Installation was smooth, things are all working well. &nbsp;Of special note to me was that my wireless NIC (Atheros chipset, madwifi driver) was installed and working, &quot;out of the box&quot;. &nbsp;First time I've seen that from any distro. &nbsp;The installer even asked me for the ESSID to use, and the WEP key. &nbsp;Amazing.<br /><br />The Synaptic package manager is surprisingly nice. &nbsp;Used it to install Thunderbird 1.02, very painless. &nbsp;This distro comes with Gnome 2.10 and kernel 2.6.10, and other stuff is very updated as well. &nbsp;One thing I'd like to improve is the way fonts look, which is not quite as good as I've seen in Mandrake or Slackware. &nbsp;Overall though, this is a promising release.<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hoary is sweet. It detected EVERYTHING on my laptop, including the elusive ipw2200 drivers for my wireless. Gentoo 2005.0 did not detect my wireless as advertised, but Ubuntu did.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I tried the preview of Hoary a couple of weeks ago and I can't say I was impressed at all. I love Debian, but Hoary just did not cut it for me. Glad you guys are having better luck with it than I did.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just got it running on my labtop, so far so good. I've got a question though, by default it comes with Gnome, can I use KDE without switching to Kubuntu?<br />Thanks,<br /><br />Jaymz</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">From my understanding Kubuntu is exactly the same as Ubuntu, except with KDE. When installing Kubuntu you actually go through the whole Ubuntu install then put in KDE (I am sure it is highly customized). Kubuntu is officially part of Ubuntu, so you are not getting an inferior product by using Kubuntu.<br /><br />So as the previous messages say, now that you have Ubuntu installed, install the Kubuntu and you will get what you want.<br /><br />Let us know what you think about it. I was seriously looking that direction a week or so ago, but settled on Slackware as my major focus for now.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I installed kubuntu and it seems to work fine. &nbsp;I haven't used the latest version of KDE so I don't know if they customized anything or are including a standard install.<br /><br />One thing that looked neat is the popup help when you hover your mouse over the K button on the task bar, it's big and easy to read. &nbsp;But does tend to get annoying after a while :)<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Kilar, did you read the thread that was linked to? Ubuntu has made a modification. The default Gnome way of doing file browsing stinks in my opinion. The most recent version of Ubuntu made it worse.<br /><br />This is not a Gnome issue, but an Ubuntu one. And, yes you can turn it off. But as imnes points out in the thread, why is the least intelligent way of doing things the default? (That is Gnome's forté, Ubuntu shouldn't try to up the ante on them). The best option is to install Kubuntu and blow Gnome away, but we are talking about making Ubuntu better in it's current iteration.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yes. I read the thread. Ubuntu's modification to Gnome sucks in its default state, but so does everyone else's default Gnome. Yes, it is a Gnome issue, or else you would not see all the complaints about &quot;spatial orientation&quot;. Ubuntu just exacerbated the problem by adding a few things to an already poor layout (you can tell that I am a KDE fan).<br />http://arstechnica.com/articles/paedia/finder.ars/2<br />http://linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/reviews/3301/2/<br />http://www.flexbeta.net/main/printarticle.php?id=73</div>

Yes, it is a Gnome issue, or else you would not see all the complaints about &quot;spatial orientation&quot;.</div><br />I think we have 2 different issues. I don't guess it matters. You can vote or not. Besides, do you really think that Ubuntu cares?<br /><br />One issue is that Gnome had a bad idea and the second is that Ubuntu made it worse.<br /><br />I agree, this is mostly a Gnome thing. And I dislike Gnome probably as much as anyone can, mainly for Nautilus (a simple search here on the forums will show that). But I agree with imnes that Ubuntu has been even stupider than Gnome on this (if that is possible).<br /><br />Like I say, I don't guess it really matters if we discuss it here or not, but I think that it is definately an Ubuntu issue. Too bad too. Ubuntu is a great distro but they have 2 things against them, Gnome and Debian. Thankfully there is Kubuntu.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: dpeach</div><div class="quote">Ubuntu is a great distro but they have...things against them...Debian</div><br /><br />That distro wouldn't be even close to anything if it weren't based on Debian. Believe it or not, Debian has come a long way in the past couple of years, but the packages have lagged behind. Debian brought us apt. Ubuntu's installer that everyone says works so well (just isn't pretty) is the standard Debian installer now. Ubuntu has only updated the packages of their apt repositories to newer versions with less testing. The structure and some of the core components that make Ubuntu what it is apart from any other distro are Debian all the way.<br /><br />Debian aims for stability over &quot;cool-factor&quot; in it's stable releases. Testing lags behind still, and SID is sometimes scary to use, but Ubuntu or any other distro aiming to use the newest packages are going to be comparably stable to the Testing or SID branches of Debian anyway. I don't know how many times I've installed officially released packages or installed from scratch and not had something work. With Debian stable, you know it's going to work (if you use it correctly), because it's had tons of testing and evaluation on almost every platform available.</div>

Believe it or not, Debian has come a long way in the past couple of years, but the packages have lagged behind. </div><br />I like to beat up Debian, but in reality some of the best user friendly distros have been based off of it.<br /><br />One of the things that bothers me about Debian and their followers is that &quot;if you use Debian stable all works fine. But only the bravest of the brave should go for Debian Sid.&quot; Is Sid any worse than any other distro out there? Probably more stable than others or at least as stable. So why the big deal? It seems that if you are not running stable then &quot;you are on your own.&quot; The alternative is to run last year's (or earlier) versions of software.<br /><br />All that said. Some of the distros that have done most things right have been based on Debian. I really like what I have seen of Ubuntu. I loved Corel Linux in it's day. I am sure Xandros is great. Isn't Linspire Debian based?<br /><br />Debian seems to be great to build off of. But why the extremes? Either old, old stable, or scary Sid? Sid probably is not that unstable so why make the hype about the fact that your computer might start blowing up your toys with fireworks? Sid is the kid from next door. Depending on how you make him out to be, he can be a monster (like Debian wants you to think) or he can be the kid who on occasion causes trouble, but not too bad (like Mandrake or Slackware). Just because it is current does not mean it is wicked. Face it, we all probably did something heineous on occasion to a few toys.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sid isn't that bad. Yes, occasionally, you do get some bad builds, but that will usually be from some obscure package. Stable is meant to be rock solid, production level software for situations that require that magical 99.9% uptime for mission critical services.</div>
