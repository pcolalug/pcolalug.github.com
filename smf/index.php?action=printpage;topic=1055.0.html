					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi guys. When I was first looking to see if there was a lug for the pensacola area, My first thought was to look through the several thousand channels &nbsp;on freenode to see if I could find any information there. Well, I found #pcolalug, but no people there. I eventually found my answer on google, and here I am now.:)<br /><br />What I'm getting at, is what about making use of the #pcolalug channel on freenode? One of you registered it, though I can't remember your name, *blushes*. Irc has many advantages, in that you can talk to someone in realtime, with out waiting for long time replies on something like forums or email. The other advantage to irc, is that if you need help, and none of us know the answer, freenode has several distro channels along with many other linux and programming related channels.<br /><br />I also think that if enough people got involved, it would help generate a lot more activity.<br /><br />Ok, I'm done babbling:p Anyway, there's my idea.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The only problem with IRC with a group this small is that the channel would usually be full of people who aren't even at their computer when you ask your question, and by the time they get back and read and respond you're gone. &nbsp;My thought anyway...<br /><br />Nick</div>
