					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here is why I want to know how to determine my IP address when I&quot;m connected.<br /><br />Was talking to a BellSouth DSL technical support person about how BellSouth would assign me a fixed IP address (Her name was Rhonda and confessed to being a Linux user at home.) and she said that the first time I logged on I'd have to have DHCP enabled and thereafter the IP address I first logged on with would be my fixed address. &nbsp;That is the &quot;why&quot; of my question.<br /><br />Of course I could read the instructions that come with the ethernet modem when it arrives but that is no fun &nbsp;:wink: <br /><br />Chuck</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The ifconfig (if you find it and get it working) should tell you both LAN and WAN. That is assuming that you are running this from a computer connected directly to your DSL modem/gateway. Otherwise, it will just tell you what address is assigned to that computer from your internal DHCP server.<br /><br />BTW, in Windows the command that gives you similar results is ipconfig. I am sure there are switches that will give you more information.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks guys. &nbsp;Dan, the /sbin/ifconfig did it. &nbsp;I was online with my dialup account and saw the IP address for ppp0. &nbsp;Did an nmap port scan on it and it looks like this box. &nbsp;Will try a ssh login on that address too.<br /><br />Chuck</div>
