					Post by: <b>Ed</b> on <b>December 28, 2009, 05:20:22 pm</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am not too savvy when it comes to the new phone technology. I am wanting to change from my old Motorola phone to one with a touch screen and not a big keypad. I don&#039;t do texting. I want a linux os and I plan to access the internet with it so 3G or 4G support is needed I guess. AT&amp;T does not have 3G service in my area (extreme north Santa Rosa County). Verizon shows it is available in my area but the map is too small to be sure and I can get any info on Sprint. So if you can recommend a carrier please do so. I would like comments on Android if anyone has experience with it. Any help are suggestions are appreciated. Ed </div>

I currently am running a G1 but planning on switching to the Nokia N900 which is the first maemo device that is also a phone :) If you&#039;ve ever seen an N810 you&#039;ll know how awesome maemo is.<br /><br />32gb internal storage, has expansion slot<br />Video support, has flash... etc.. .its very sexy.<br /><br />Live Demo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RP5R-5NX1BE</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for the replies. I ended up getting a Motorola Google Droid with Verizon . It works real well up here in the woods. I am just starting to play with it now. The google maps on it are great. It has driving directions too. There are a lot of 3rd party apps on the internet for it also.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m glad you are pleased with it. My younger brother was looking at getting an iPhone (which I have and am pleased with), but I suggested he strongly look at the Droid. He has not gotten it yet, but that is probably the one he will get.<br /><br />Give us an update in a couple of weeks and tell us what you love and hate about it after putting it through its paces. I am very interested in the Droid for when I move to Argentina. Except down there we have the Milestone which is the same hardware as the Droid, but all the features work. Motorola crippled the phone for the US market. I think it has to do with some patents in the US that they would get in trouble for. But my Milestone will be unlocked when I buy it and I can use it here when I get back.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I was going to suggest the Milestone, but for the life of me, I couldn&#039;t remember the name of it!&nbsp; From what I&#039;ve read, currently the Milestone runs the latest release of Android, and, as dpeach said, has a few features enabled on it that the Droid does not..&nbsp; Either way, the Droid is still a nice phone, and I bet you could get it rooted/unlocked if you wanted to, and reenable all those disabled bells and whistles!<br /><br />Ian</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well I had to return my Droid after a week of being on the land line phone with Verizon trying to get a usable phone signal in my shop behind my house. They set me up to use Alltel towers also but I could not get a connection so I had to return them and go by to Nextel which seem to be the only option in my area. They don&#039;t have digital data so I am stuck until one of the 3g carriers builds more towers&nbsp; in my area.<br /><br />As for the Droid it was great but it did have a lower quality voice sound than it should for the price of the phone. There were some fixes on the Droid Forum but none worked for me. I am going through my new 2 year contract with Nextel and maybe by then there will be something usable in my area.</div>

I ended up getting a Motorola Google Droid with Verizon . It works real well up here in the woods. I am just starting to play with it now. The google maps on it are great. It has driving directions too. There are a lot of 3rd party apps on the internet for it also.<br /><br />I had not used the phone part at that point but it worked OK for me when I did made calls most of the short time I had it. My way of thinking is if it would work where I need it to in the panhandle area thats OK but my wife has an aging mother (87) who is in bad health and my wife depends on a fully reliable cell phone for her mother to call her and the medical people who attend to her to be able to contact my wife. The phone would not connect at all in my wife&#039;s wood working work shop behind the house.<br /><br />Bottom line is the data or 3g part worked real well but not the phone part. I see you are starting it again Dan. You know what you are trying to do making these useless comparisons of my comments &nbsp;to agitate someone on the forum just like you did before you were banned. I doubt it will be long before you get banned for good. And I do mean good. &nbsp; ;)<br /><br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Actually, I was a little confused as well when you said, &quot;It works reall well up here in the woods&quot;. &nbsp;Which to me meant you could get a good signal out in the boonies. &nbsp;Then saying, &quot;trying to get a usable phone signal in my shop behind my house&quot;. &nbsp; :???:<br /><br />Just my thoughts.&nbsp; I am happy you came back and posted more information on it though.&nbsp; I was going to recommend it to someone who has Verizon as their provider.&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe I will tell them to wait till the Nexus One comes out on Verizon&#039;s network instead.<br /><br />Lee</div>
