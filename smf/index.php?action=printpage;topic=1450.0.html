					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'd like to come to your LinuxInstallation festival next weekend and get Linux installed on my old computer properly but I had a thought.<br /><br />I'm currently running Fedora on a 1.0Ghz, 128MB RAM machine with built-in video card (which makes poor performance for Xwin but that's besides the point). &nbsp;It's slow but for the most part it works, minus the few issues I've listed on your board here.<br /><br />I've been thinking...perhaps it'd be a good idea to use another distribution. &nbsp;I originally wanted to run Gentoo but of course that installation failed and I thought it'd be fun to try Slackware but nobody seemed to have the ISOs.<br /><br />If you're primarily doing Mandrake and Fedora I'm going to hazard a guess that those are the distros you think might perform the best for most users (friendliness, performance balance). &nbsp;However, if I wanted to run something different (like Slackware of Gentoo) what would be the primary differences in difficulty, performance, usability, and stability?<br /><br />It's hard for me to find anywhere that can tell me the benefits of using one distro over another so I figured I'd ask you all.<br /><br />Thank you for any help with this rather vague question. &nbsp;=)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">well if u want to spend a good bit of time learning, slackware is a good choice and i'm extremely happy with it....running 2.6.x kernel and dropline-gnome great<br /><br />if you look at the mirrors there are a good bit of them with the iso files, or just read the guide about how to build your own iso<br /><br />I'd only recommend slackware if you either know atleast enough about linux to get everything working properly or your willing to spend some time learning, otherwise it might be a bit on the frustrating side to some people<br /><br />if you do jump into slackware i highly recommend using swaret for updating the packages, and if your a gnome fan check out dropline-gnome &nbsp;:wink: <br /><br />and if your comfortable configuring and compiling your own kernel, I definetely recommend 2.6.x kernel &nbsp;:D</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">In that case I suppose I'll have to say goodbye to my dreams of running Slackware for the moment. &nbsp;This box I'm doing a lot of C and Java coding for my final semester at UWF and that means downtime needs to be minimal. &nbsp;Getting things running would not be my forte as I'm still learning the ins-and-outs of <b>using</b> Linux, let alone advanced setup.<br /><br />I suppose if I can't get Xfree working for Debian on this box I shouldn't be messing with anything advanced for the moment.<br /><br /><br /><br />This might be totally masochistic but how's FreeBSD? &nbsp;I know it's technically not Linux but just an idle thought.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Come to the install fest we will get you up and running with slackware with a full range of development tools, even the latest java sdk 1.5 ;)<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Oh, I'll be coming to your festival. &nbsp;=) However, if Slackware is that difficult to use then mere setup may not be enough. &nbsp;Can't have something breaking and leaving me in the dust, now can we? &nbsp;=P<br /><br />But if the difficulty is more in the setup than the maintennance I think it would be fun to run Slackware. &nbsp;I hear lots of good things about it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I believe the challenge of Linux is in the setup. Once you get it running, and you do not change the hardware, you should be fine.<br /><br />The reason I would recommend Mandrake, especially to someone installing it themselves for the first time, is that it seems to handle most of the setup for you. One of the reasons to run a distro like Slack is that you don't want 50 drivers loaded for your one video card. Slack is much more streamlined than Mandrake. The &quot;fatness&quot; of Mandrake is due to it's wanting to support everything it can the first time around.<br /><br />You <b>will</b> learn alot about Linux if you run Slack. You <b>could</b> learn about Linux if you run Mandrake. Mandrake for me just works. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in just using their machine. But running Mandrake will not force you to learn all the intricate details of Linux unless you learn them on purpose. Running Slackware will give you much more opportunity to learn how Linux really works. <br /><br />I have never run Slack, but I do run Gentoo on one machine. I learned more in the first 2 weeks about Linux with Gentoo than in the 6 other years of Linux use. That may be a bit of a stretch. But the point is, Slack will be alot more work to get going, but you will probably enjoy it tremendously if you are interested in learning and tweaking. Mandrake is a little boring, but you certainly can get alot of work done without knowing the details.<br /><br />My 2 pennies.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You can also address performance issues by the desktop packages you choose to run. Instead of running kitchen sink desktop environments (KDE/Gnome), try one of the lighter packages such as XFCE (http://www.xfce.org) or Fluxbox (http://www.fluxbox.org). You won't get a lot of the bells and wistles with these, but you will get a noticable increase in performance.<br /><br />Also, lloydr is right in that the newer kernels would probably give you a boost in performance, but again, you'd want to configure it to be lean.<br /><br />Ultimately, I'd reccomend Gentoo, Debian, or Slackware for older hardware. However, from the specs you mentioned, you shouldn't have any problems running any modern distro. I was running Red Hat 8.0 on a PIII 650 for almost a year with no problems.<br /><br />If its an XFree config problem, just bring the box as-is to the install fest and we should be able to get you up and running, barring really bad video card.</div>
