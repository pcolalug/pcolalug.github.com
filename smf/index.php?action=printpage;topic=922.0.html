					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey all you crazy people :)<br /><br />I just found this part of the Forum. &nbsp;This place is huge. &nbsp;Lots to browse through. Lots of old outdated posts too.. LOL<br /><br />I'm a guy who wants to learn. I have no prior experience with Linux but I think I found a Pot o' Gold here with most of you.. (just between you &amp; me I think you might have some crazy people in here... And I'm one of them)<br /><br />But anyway I've posted already which is way cool to get the helpful responses. &nbsp;And believe me I'm going to keep asking questions too. &nbsp;I'll try to look for the answers before asking but I might ask too soon sometimes.<br /><br />I'm looking for well-written books too. &nbsp;It's one thing to have a book that gives all the facts but it's entirely different to have one that explains the information in a learnable format.<br /><br />All I know is how to move around in Windows &amp; have some DOS knowledge. &nbsp;I'm jumping into this because I can already tell Linux is the best preventative maintenance for my computer. &nbsp;So please help me to learn it.. I'm drowning in the CLI.. lol<br /><br />I'll see you at the next meeting at Oscar's &nbsp;:lol: <br /><br />Zyman</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi Zyman,<br /><br />I'm a linux newbie too and this forum is a great place to get information and help solving Linux problems.<br /><br />I found a great book from O'Reilly computer books called <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Running Linux 4th edition</span>. &nbsp;I had no experience with Unix/Linux whatever and this book really explained things on a basic level. &nbsp;O'Reilly also has a great book on basic UNIX functions and also a good book on the BASH shell.<br /><br />The PCOLALUG.ORG also has a number of books in the club library that you can request through this forum and pick up at one of the monthly group meetings.<br /><br />Oh yeah, welcome to the group &nbsp;:D</div>
