					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well guys I am back in the swing of things again after surgery and all!<br />Well I have acquired a few new toys the first being a Nokia n770 http://europe.nokia.com/A4144786 (http://europe.nokia.com/A4144786).<br />I have been busy with this one as I have been looking for a portable Pentesting device.<br />This seems to be the ideal solution....I have also ordered a blue tooth keyboard and gps for it and plan on getting<br />a 2gb mmc-mobile card also....I have been busy..busy...busy getting the apps I wanted loaded on it...<br />Nmap, Kismet, tcpdump, ping, traceroute, aircrack-ptw, and of course metasploit.<br />I also installed ruby and gems with rails for metasploit. wish I could find a ruby-ftk2 and ruby-libglade2 deb also :)<br />But mfsweb and mfsconsole work..with mfsconsole being my poison of choice.<br />Kismet works really well.....I had read about false reading and have not had that problem yet.<br /><br />I also installed xchat, vnc-viewer, vim, and bash to boot.....for them slow times I loaded DOOM also.<br />Got to have atleast one game.<br /><br />Update installing a bluetooth sniffer as I write this since this device has bluetooth and wifi built in.<br />Plan on having it at this months meeting,<br /><br />My second Toy was a new book hacking the wrt54g. http://www.amazon.com/Linksys-WRT54G-Ultimate-Hacking-Asadoorian/dp/1597491667 (http://www.amazon.com/Linksys-WRT54G-Ultimate-Hacking-Asadoorian/dp/1597491667)<br />This is a great book all about hacking all the models of the wrt54g, wrtsl54gs and wrt54gs.<br />I plan on printing out the section on adding sd card to your router...for general talk at next meeting.<br /><br />Anyway that is what I have been up to while I was recuperating.....Hope to see you all at the meeting.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Bhoff,<br />I have been looking at the N770 and N800 for sometime now.&nbsp; What made you choose the N770 over the N800?&nbsp; From what I have read they are kind of sluggish.&nbsp; That has kind of put me off from buying one.&nbsp; What do you think of the performance?<br /><br />Lee</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I choose it due to the fact another LUG member had it for sale at the right time.<br />And as far as performance, Well it is no Laptop! But for what it is and what I do with it it is great.<br />I use it to check emails when I have a wifi connection. browse web mostly but also pentesting with traceroute, Nmap, MEtasploit, Kismet and bluetooth sniffer. So yea I have been impressed I will have it at next meeting for all to see.<br /></div>
