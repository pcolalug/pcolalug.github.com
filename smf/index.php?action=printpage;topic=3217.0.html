					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yep that is the headline you will be reading very soon.<br />I have secured the consulting gig for the City to start migration to Open-Source.<br />I had my first meet and greet today with the heads and staff of MIS for the City of Pensacola.<br />And I am here to tell you I see a rise in LUG numbers to as several ask me where we have our meetings.<br />They are starting with office applications then Desktops and finally servers...All Open Source.<br />This all came about from the presentation that I gave to ITGulfCoast. It shall be an interesting project along<br />with the Science lab migration in Santa Rosa schools this fall. I will release facts as I can.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would think not I am only consulting which breaks out to maybe one or two meetings a month for the next 18-24 months maybe longer.<br />They are doing all the implementation as of right now. We will see where it goes ....I am also looking at an opportunity to instruct the COMP TIA Linux+ for Triangle technology. I have the next presentation ready to go which will talk about tracking email spams to there originating source and dealing with them. Also cleaning up the last presentation I gave to be posted before next meeting.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well they went with ubuntu and edbuntu for the libraries. They are still moving forward and working on diffrent issues like servers and implementing the big thigs first.<br />I know that they are using it as the primary desktops on remote or satellite offices and will be coming to a office near you soon.<br /><br />Also Jan. 8th I am meeting with LakeView Center about Open Source they are just felling out options at this time and not sure where this will go.<br /><br />As far as getting updates I am not involved in the actual migration as they took my advice and used google to get the answers.<br />But I got the word at my last ITGulfCoast talk that all is going as planned and going well.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Wow, that&#039;s great to hear.&nbsp; At this rate maybe the phrase &quot;2010 will be the year of the Linux Desktop&quot; won&#039;t be laughed at.&nbsp; XD</div>
