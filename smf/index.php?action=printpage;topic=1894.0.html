					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hola Penguinistas---Just to give a status report. &nbsp;My little block house on Pensacola Beach is in amazingly good condition. &nbsp;It had chest-high water and the contents (including my two computers) are completely trashed. &nbsp;The place is filthy but I can deal with that.<br /><br />Authorities are restricting access to the Island and it is still under martial law. &nbsp;This is actually a good thing, although inconvenient for me, because there is still a lot of sand to be cleared off roads by heavy equipment and Gulf Power has a lot of work to do with power lines.<br /><br />This Sunday residents will be allowed on the Island 08:00-17:00. &nbsp;I'll be toting nasty things out to the street trying to clear the house of all my stuff.<br /><br />In good spirits but for sure a space cadet from the aftermath of Ivan.<br /><br />If I ever get back in the house with electricity and my DSL I'm going to have built a Linux box on steroids. &nbsp;I evacuated with my FC2 and PGP disks.<br /><br />Chuck/sandspur<br />http://www.pcola.com/sandspur/</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Chuck, good to hear from you. Sorry it is under such conditions. Let the group know if there is anything you need to at least get something up and running. I am sure someone can temporarily get you a machine to work with.<br /><br />Just let the group know.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I second dpeach here. If there's anything you or anyone else needs to get a temporary box up and running due to loss, please don't hesitate to request some stuff from the rest of the group. A lot of us made out much better than it seems you did, and i'm sure there's enough parts between us all to put some &quot;relief rigs&quot; together for those that need 'em. Glad to hear you are well and in good spirits. Let us know if there's anything we can do to help.</div>
