					Title: <b>GPL Question</b><br />

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm making a major modification to a program I downloaded from the net. The program consists of 605 php files. The modification I'm making only requires major changes to 3 of the files.<br /><br />My question is, to make this modification available to the general public what do I need to include in the download? I know I need the GPL file but do I need to zip up the whole program again, or can I just zip up the changed files and instructions on replacing them?<br /><br />Or, is there an easier way to release this?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You might be able to send them back to the original author and get him to include the changes in the next release.<br /><br />Otherwise I'd suggest releasing the whole zip with changes (because I'm lazy and don't like patching.) &nbsp;:)<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Zipping up the changed files for re-distribution will also suffice if it's GPL'd software. &nbsp;<br /><br />But I'd suggest contacting the author, and seeing if s/he would be interested in rolling your changes back into the mainline code. &nbsp;It just tends to make life easier for all. &nbsp;8)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Even if the project seems dead, it is courtesy to try and get in touch with the devs and submit a patch. If you can't get any response, you may want to take over the project yourself (with their blessing, of course), or try and find another user/dev to do so. By distributing the project on your own, you give the impression of forking the project, and that could be frowned upon without doing these other things. It won't be illegal, mind you, just in bad taste.</div>

Even though it's questionable whether it's still being actively developed, it is a very popular program. <br /><br />BTW, if you're wondering the program is PHProjekt (http://www.phprojekt.com/)<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">There are many sites out there, like SourceForge, &nbsp;that host OSS projects for free, so bandwidth shouldn't be an issue.</div>
