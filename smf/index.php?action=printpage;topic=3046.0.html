					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I reckon I&#039;m officially done with slackware.<br /><br />I wanted to install slack 11 this weekend, just to give it a spin, but I ran into a major problem.<br /><br />I have xfs partitions set up on my nice shiny sata drive that i wanted to use for slackware.&nbsp; Slackware has a boot kernel for sata support.&nbsp; Slackware has a boot kernel for xfs support.&nbsp; Lo and behold, slackware has NO kernel for xfs and sata support&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />IMO slack should have a sata kernel that supports most journaling file systems (ext3,rieser, xfs, and jfs).&nbsp; It wouldn&#039;t really add *that* much weight to the default kernel, and besides, who uses the default kernel anyways?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">actually, for kernels, the xfs kernel DOES infact support sata.<br /><br />http://slackware.mirrors.tds.net/pub/slackware/slackware-11.0/kernels/SATA-SUPPORT.TXT<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">xfs.s/config:# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_SATA is not set<br />xfs.s/config:CONFIG_SCSI_SATA=y<br />xfs.s/config:CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_AHCI=m<br />xfs.s/config:CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_SVW=m<br />xfs.s/config:CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_NV=m<br />xfs.s/config:CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_QSTOR=m<br />xfs.s/config:CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_PROMISE=m<br />xfs.s/config:CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_SX4=m<br />xfs.s/config:CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_SIL=m<br />xfs.s/config:CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_SIS=m<br />xfs.s/config:CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_ULI=m<br />xfs.s/config:CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_VIA=m<br />xfs.s/config:CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_VITESSE=m<br /></div><br />it is set as modules as far as the individual devices, like all kernels. only difference in the sata kernel is that the devices are all set to yes.<br /><br />also, in the sata kernel, xfs support is set as a module. <br /><br />now, there is a tool called minitrd that is used in this situation <br /><br />when you read /boot/README.initrd, you see this:<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">The usual reason to use an initrd is because you need to load kernel<br />modules before mounting the root partition. Usually these modules are<br />required to support the filesystem used by the root partition (ext3,<br />reiserfs, xfs), or perhaps the controller that the hard drive is attached<br />to (SCSI, RAID, etc). Essentially, there are so many different options<br />available in modern Linux kernels that it isn&#039;t practical to try to ship<br />many different kernels to try to cover everyone&#039;s needs. It&#039;s a lot more<br />flexible to ship a generic kernel and a set of kernel modules for it.<br /></div><br />best bet would be use sata kernel and use mkinitrd for xfs, _OR_ if you look at using huge26 kernel..... it has _EVERYTHING_<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">huge26.s/config:# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_SATA is not set<br />huge26.s/config:CONFIG_SCSI_SATA=y<br />huge26.s/config:CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_AHCI=y<br />huge26.s/config:CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_SVW=y<br />huge26.s/config:CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_MV=y<br />huge26.s/config:CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_NV=y<br />huge26.s/config:CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_QSTOR=y<br />huge26.s/config:CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_PROMISE=y<br />huge26.s/config:CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_SX4=y<br />huge26.s/config:CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_SIL=y<br />huge26.s/config:CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_SIL24=y<br />huge26.s/config:CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_SIS=y<br />huge26.s/config:CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_ULI=y<br />huge26.s/config:CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_VIA=y<br />huge26.s/config:CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_VITESSE=y<br />huge26.s/config:CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_INTEL_COMBINED=y<br /></div>all sata enabled, and, http://slackware.mirrors.tds.net/pub/slackware/slackware-11.0/kernels/huge26.s/config<br />looking at config, xfs is added directly in, rather than a module.<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">CONFIG_XFS_FS=y<br />CONFIG_XFS_EXPORT=y<br />CONFIG_XFS_QUOTA=y<br />CONFIG_XFS_SECURITY=y<br />CONFIG_XFS_POSIX_ACL=y</div><br />;) next time, I&#039;d recommend researching the kernel variations first heh... they all have the same essential base. although, to save from having a monster bloated kernel with everything enabled like huge26, they just kick certain things back to module, but mkinitrd is always there.....</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Wow, that was a lot of RTFM. I understand where Brent is coming from. I think it&#039;s completely understandable to expect a modern distro to detect and properly handle your hardware. You guys are acting like he insulted your first born child by voicing his dislike of Slackware. My question is, why on earth is 2.4 still the default kernel and why is it that the kernel that supports such common hardware and better filesystems not the default? It is only the install kernel and those that want a more finely tuned kernel can and will compile their own. Most distros include all of the necessary modules but only enables the ones that are necessary for the target system based on hardware detection at install. This definitely touches on a point that I think is valid and not really deserving of the response it received. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">To be fair, back when I was using slackware, all the documentation I read on the included 2.6 kernel basically stated that 2.4 should be installed first, and then 2.6 is installed, just so you have a safety net if something goes wrong.&nbsp; Also, 2.6 comes on the second cd (or used to).&nbsp; Since I never download the second cd, booting from 2.6 never even crossed my mind.&nbsp; Heck I didn&#039;t even know the installer would correctly set 2.6 up from boot.&nbsp; ^-^<br /><br />Anyway, during the whole slackware shebang, I reinstalled xubuntu.&nbsp; That&#039;s when I realized that customizing slackware to look and feel like xubuntu would take alot more customization than it&#039;d be worth.&nbsp; Although linux is linux, some flavors taste different than others, and lately I&#039;ve gotten used to *buntu.</div>

For this reason, no one should be pushing the Slackware crowd to do anything differently. It may not make sense to the folks that find Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, SUSE, or Gentoo attractive, but it makes sense to Slackware folks.
