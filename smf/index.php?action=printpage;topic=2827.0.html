					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">These Microsoft delays, just give other OS&#039;s (free and commercial) more time to penetrate deeper into the enterprise.  While Bill and company scratch their heads, reorganize, etc., Red Hat, Novell, Apple, Sun Solaris on Intel, etc. continue their steady push into the enterprise.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">For me, Apple&#039;s OSX is a non-contender, specifically because it doesn&#039;t work on &#039;commodity hardware&#039;.&nbsp; I suppose people are wow&#039;d by OS X&#039;s snazzy graphics, but to me, they don&#039;t look any better or more useful than gnome.<br /><br />I still use win2k for gaming and .net dev, but for everything else, I use linux.&nbsp; MS is gona end all support for win2k this month, and XP when they release Vista (though that could be a while&nbsp; ::)) which means legacy windows users will be left in the cold for security patches.&nbsp; Honestly though, since most of the remotely executable security holes in windows stem from IE and MS outlook, I don&#039;t see it affecting me greatly.&nbsp; However, I doubt I&#039;ll be into PC gaming that much longer if it means using a DRM&#039;d OS, or screwing with cedega and hoping the game works half as well as it does in windows. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Apple may threaten Microsoft, since more consumers resort to pre-built computers nowadays-- Dell, Sony, Gateway-- instead of buying parts at the store. Apple is probably banking on consumers thinking, &quot;Should I pay $1100 for a Dell desktop, or $1100 for an Apple desktop?&quot; This is assuming prices will equalize between Apples and PCs. If the price of certain Apples does not come down, then people will still stick with PCs. Otherwise, Apple can threaten Microsoft. If there are a lot of consumers who still put together their own systems, or who refuse to buy desktops with OSes preloaded, then Linux may be the one to threaten Microsoft. In other words, Apple may be a contender.</div>
