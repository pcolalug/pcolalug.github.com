					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">What is your favorite Window Manager and Desktop Environment on your OS of choice and why?<br /><br />I have come to prefer Gnome as of late, but hate Metacity as the window manager. Maybe I should say that I like Gnome's panel and menus and the GTK+ toolset over KDE and Qt. On a high res display, I like WindowMaker. Those boxes are too big on anything below 1280x1024. I still like to use the Gnome panel from time to time with WMaker, but it doesn't look typical when I do.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm a Gnome fan myself also. &nbsp;Especially the latest in the 2.x series. &nbsp;Looks a lot cleaner and more refined than KDE. &nbsp;Before someone jumps down my throat, hey - it's just my opinion. &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />(http://www.gnome.org/start/2.1/screenshots/fonts-thumb.png)<br />Desktop wide font support (http://www.gnome.org/start/2.1/screenshots/fonts.png)<br /><br /><br /><br />(http://www.gnome.org/start/2.1/screenshots/theme-thumb.png)<br />Updated themes including high contrast, all with matching icons (http://www.gnome.org/start/2.1/screenshots/theme.png)<br /><br /><br /><br />(http://www.gnome.org/start/2.1/screenshots/panel-thumb.png)<br />Improved multihead support for the Panel, simliar to Xinerama. (http://www.gnome.org/start/2.1/screenshots/panel.png)<br /><br /><br /><br />(http://www.gnome.org/start/2.1/screenshots/nautilus-thumb.png)<br />Nautilus themes have been removed to allow icon theming across the desktop as specified by the freedesktop.org icon theme spec. (http://www.gnome.org/start/2.1/screenshots/nautilus.png)<br /><br /><br /><br />(http://www.gnome.org/start/2.1/screenshots/utilities-thumb.png)<br />gedit has a whole host of new plugins and features, including auto-indentation, sorting and inline spell-check (http://www.gnome.org/start/2.1/screenshots/utilities.png)<br /><br /><br />Things are looking good anyway. &nbsp;So who's gonna speak up on KDE3 for us?<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">My favorite desktop environment is XDM/bash. ;)<br /><br />Really, though, I think KDE is prettier, more mature, and the apps seem more user-friendly. Then again, its all in what you're used to, I suppose.<br /><br />With 3.1, you also get &quot;out of the box&quot; desktop sharing and the new kiosk framework, which is great for keeping the newbs in your life from mucking with things that would get them in trouble. And, I think Qt has nicer widgets and themes, as well as a &quot;cleaner&quot; API (again, just my 2 pesetas).<br /><br />My dirty little secret is that I got into OSS because I ran across screenshots of FreeBSD running Enlightenment on Gnome. For all of my preaching about technical superiority, it was the fluff that drew me in... :oops:</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I used to like KDE until I found a nasty bug in it was crashing Linux. I hope they fixed the bug by now but I haven't tried it lately. I found that when in KDE using an Nvidia card and drivers in a multi-desktop environment, KDE would eat up memory and not release it. <br /><br />Here's what happened:<br /><br />1. I, like many Linux users, run multiple desktops. <br />2. When I switched from one desktop to another, the memory used on the system would increase. <br />3. When I switched back to the original desktop, the memory would not be released.<br />4. Sooner or later, I would use up all physical memory and the system would go into a never ending memory swapping routine. This would lock up the mouse and keyboard. I would have to hit the reset button on the computer and do a hard reboot to fix it. <br /><br />I tested and verified this problem in KDE and verfied that it did not exist in Gnome.<br /><br />So, I switched to Gnome and haven't looked back.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: rburt3</div><div class="quote">I think KDE is prettier...</div><br /><br />I bet you like the Fisher-Price XP UI, huh? :twisted: Heh...I just don't like the UI philosophy of KDE that bigger is BETTER. I like a very unimposing, minimal UI. Contrasting colors and large icons don't please me one bit.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: rburt3</div><div class="quote">I think Qt has nicer widgets and themes...</div><br /><br />If the widgets weren't so cartoony, I would like them better because I think GTk+ is a little rough for the most part. I also don't like a mix of AA GTK+ 2.0 and non-AA GTK+ 1.x. It looks bad and incongruous. The differences also make it harder to find matching themes...not that I'm a big themer, but I like having a single flowing desktop environment throughout.<br /><br />I think if they could refine GTK+ a little more or if KDE could come up with some more professional looking widgets, I could be swayed either way. Honestly, though, I really do like Windows UI pre-XP. It isn't pretty, but it stays out of the way for the most part. I'm not UI expert, but my favorites are the win2k default UI and then WMaker.</div>

We need a longer thread...</div><br /><br />Yeah...this is a debate of the <b>current</b> state of desktop environments and is not necessarily restricted to KDE and Gnome. Maybe we should branch out to include Mac OS X, BeOS, Windows, etc. Also, KDE and Gnome isn't the &nbsp;only Desktop Environment for Linux/*BSD/etc. <br /><br />What is your favorite?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">KDE widgets are not XP-ish, they're Mac-ish... :P Besides, the themes/widgets you see currently are just an expression of the predominant tastes of the user-base. The theme engine for Qt is powerful enough to make widgets look like anything you like, including Win2K. This is so because the Windows inteface for Qt apps is *not* native, but the theme engine.</div>

I think it is past time for someone to make something better than what we already have for a user interface. I see too many OSS projects that are merely trying to emulate something that has already been done. That's just the thing...<b>it's already been done!</b><br /><br />Innovate for pete's sake instead of replicate. Yes, it is hard and it requires some sort of mild genius, but if people would stop putting so much effort into making the same thing only on X platform, we could have something really worth presenting people to encourage them to come to an open source based desktop environment complete with truely better programs.</div>
