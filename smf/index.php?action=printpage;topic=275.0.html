					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The installation went okay. I tried minimal system a couple of times but kept missing things that caused problems. I did the default install and it went well. Programs that I don't need got installed because I got tried of dependency problems. It is not a bad distro but 7.2 work just as well for me. I now have cable internet and am looking for a program similar to Knetload. Don't install the drivers from Nvidia until after you install the Suse one.<br /><br />stocke2: I don't have a cd writer right now. &nbsp;:(</div>
