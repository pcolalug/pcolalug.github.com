					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello, <br />I should be moving to Pensacola after the summer to finish up my BS at UWF. I have been using Linux for about 2 or 2 1/2 years. I am currently working on the Development team for Gentoo Linux, right now concentrating mostly on documentation ad webmaster. I was hoping to find a good LUG in P'cola, and look forward to meeting you all.<br /><br />Eric Stockbridge</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I got your e-mail sent to info. I'll answer the questions here as I've had a couple of people e-mail me asking what goes on at meeting and what the group does. (Maybe we can get this put on the web site?)<br /><br />The group was formed sometime late last year or early this year. So we are a young Linux group. Anyway, if you browse through the meeting notes you'll see we try to keep the meetings fairly short so we can talk geek afterwards. We are working on getting some presentations/training together. We had one install fest that had one person show up but that was months ago. We plan on another install fest sometime after the new year, if the interest is there.<br /><br />&nbsp;So, as you can see we are working on moving forward and every little bit helps. If you have suggestions etc. feel free to post them here or come to a meeting or two or three...<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Steve</div>
