					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello,<br />I've been reading the Red Hat Linux 9 Bible.<br />I'm also in the process of installing Red Hat but that is another topic.<br /><br />I would like to know where I could find out just what icons, symbols, commands, features and anything related to running an operating system would be a &quot;legal&quot; wrongdoing if copied or duplicated.<br /><br />In simple terms.. I want to create my own distribution &amp; want to know what I cannot copy from Microsoft or anyone else; and I shouldn't have to hire a lawyer to figure it out.<br /><br />If anyone can direct me to someone who can help me then I sure would appreciate it. &nbsp; Thank you for your time in this matter.<br /><br />Zyman</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am not legal expert, so keep that in mind when taking my advice.<br /><br />From the way I understand copyrights, once the item/writing/drawing is put on paper, or computer screen, or any form of tangible media, it is copyrighted. And is the legal property of whoever put it down. Therefore, every icon you would like to use is copyrighted, in the legal sense.<br /><br />Now, that does not mean that you cannot use it. There are many icon sets that I have seen that are freely distributable and useable. But I would shy away from anything that did not expressly say that, or that you do not have a letter from the originator saying that you can use it.<br /><br />I think it would be highly unlikely to get permission to use anything Microsoft, or even many of the main line Linux distros. <br /><br />But...<br /><br />If I also remember correctly, if you change an icon by 10% or more, then it becomes a new product and therefore can become your copyrighted material. Now the question I have heard raised is, how can you prove a 10% change? That is for you and the other people's lawyers to find out. I also believe that simply changing the physical size does not count towards the 10% change.<br /><br />Hope that helps.<br /><br />And welcome.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think, in general, you can't copy anything from Microsoft. &nbsp;WineX is distributing Microsoft DLLs and InstallShield code in their commercial releases but I'm guessing they pay licensing fees for it.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure icons and backgrounds and 'look &amp; feel' from microsoft, and apple are off limits. &nbsp;<br /><br />As far as linux software I dunno. &nbsp;I think some of the bundled custom software that distro's provide (like the programs redhat-config-* in RedHat, or drake-* from Mandrake) can't be redistributed. &nbsp;I thought the same about the custom icons and themes they make, but I've seen RedHat's icon set turning up in Dropline Gnome?<br /><br />Icons, backgrounds, themes, there are tons of great 'free' sets to choose from, so you shouldn't have a problem there. &nbsp;Installer and config utilities you'll have to roll your own or use GPL'd alternatives like linuxconf. &nbsp;Good luck.</div>
