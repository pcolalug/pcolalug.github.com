					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">First of all, I'd like to thank &quot;rburt3&quot; for his post last year prior to the elections. &nbsp;I have cut-n-pasted much of that into this year's post... &nbsp;:) &nbsp;Thanks rburt3!<br /><br />It's time again to nominate Steering Committee members for the coming year. &nbsp;Please post your nominations in this thread. &nbsp;Be sure to include name (and/or forum name) and the position you wish to nominate this person for. &nbsp;If you have multiple nominations, please include them in a single post.<br /><br />The Steering Committee is a core group of LUG members who are responsible for the day-to-day running of P'cola LUG. The positions are:<br /><br />1. President - responsible for inter-organizational contacts, organizing events, and presides over meetings. &nbsp;<b>Incumbent: lloydr</b><br /><br />2. Vice President - primary assistant to the President and responsible for President's duties, should the President be unavailable. &nbsp;<b>Incumbent: imnes</b><br /><br />3. Secretary - responsible for intra-organizational communication, posting meeting notes and announcements. Also responsible for forwarding/replying to email sent to info@pcolalug.org. &nbsp;<b>Incumbent: danc</b><br /><br />4. Librarian - responsible for the P'cola LUG library administration, &quot;review book&quot; ordering and distribution, and primary contact for O'Reilly. &nbsp;<b>Incumbent: mitchr</b><br /><br />Two other positions - Webmaster and SysAdmin - are also part of the Steering Committee and are appointed by same. These folks are responsible for the maintenance of our website and hardware assets respectively. &nbsp;These two positions can be held by a single person. <b>Incumbent: hitechwizard</b><br />&nbsp;<br />If you are nominated, please carefully consider your acceptance. These positions take some time, effort, and commitment on your part. It's not much, really, but please consider your other obligations. Talk to some of the current and/or former Committee members if you have specific questions about a position. &nbsp;<b>Once you have decided to accept (or decline) the nomination, please post a reply in this thread to that effect!</b><br /><br />Nominations will be accepted from now until the <b>15th of September</b>. We will vote as a group at the September meeting (9/17). You must be present at the September meeting to vote, but you don't have to be there to win. &nbsp;The new committee should have all appointed positions filled and officially assume its duties on October 1st.<br /><br />Please take a minute to consider who you'd like to see elected to help our LUG function and grow, and <b>PLEASE</b> set aside some time to make it to the September meeting to VOTE!<br /><br />Dan<br />PLUG Secretary</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I want to thank anyone that intends to nominate me for any position, but I am forced to decline beforehand. My present health situation would prevent me from giving the job all that would be required.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I want to nominate danc for president. He appears to have the most drive and sincerly holds the lugs's best interest at heart. Other nominations will follow as I find out their names.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Harold</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thank you - I will accept the nomination for President.<br /><br />I am a little concerned with the lack of nominations for the other elected positions. &nbsp;Is there no interest in this, or what?<br /><br />If anyone is interested in serving in one of these positions, please speak up and volunteer, even if you haven't been nominated. &nbsp;In other words, you can nominate yourself. &nbsp;Don't be shy!<br /><br />I will wait a short period, and then make some nominations myself.<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would like to nominate Imnes for secretary. I would also like to nominate lloydr for the position of librarian. He seems to have a good working relationship with Marsee, our contact at O'Reilly.</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">OK, here's some more input... &nbsp;From what I can gather, imnes may be a little busy to do the Secretary job, but might be willing to do another year as Vice President...<br /><br />So, I'll nominate him (imnes) for VP, and I'll second the nomination of (lloydr) to be Librarian.<br /><br />If I am elected to the Steering Committee, I will also push to make the following appointments:<br />Webmaster: &nbsp;Rugmonster<br />System Admin: &nbsp;Lloydr &nbsp;(once the server move to SSI is completed)<br /><br />Anyone interested in the Secretary position? &nbsp;If so, please volunteer and nominate yourself... &nbsp; :) <br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'll go ahead and nominate Ian/Deserir (green_dragon37) for Secretary.<br /><br />he's been active at the past meetings and has been one of the regulars in IRC and enemy territory for a while now.<br /><br />Time to bring some new blood into the lug (stolen from bhoff from last years elections &nbsp;:lol:)</div>
