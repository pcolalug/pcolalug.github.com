					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Anyone know when the SUSE Enterprise Linux Desktop is scheduled to be released? I keep seeing awesome screenshots of it and I must say, it&#039;s really piqued my interest. I just want to know when they&#039;re releasing the bugger.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know about you guys, but this next release season seems like it&#039;s going to be a big one. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Everything I&#039;ve heard says May this year.&nbsp; Which is why I wonder about the stability of the XGL stuff since that&#039;s their primary x server.&nbsp; But from what I&#039;ve seen I am planning to try a copy.&nbsp; No luck applying for the beta yet.<br /><br />Nick<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Nick, do you know what the pricing is going to be like?&nbsp; It&#039;s been a long time since I really felt excited about a new distro release.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Supposedly won&#039;t change much from the current price point, I think $50 per machine per year.&nbsp; I hope they come up with something more friendly to home users though, maybe $50 per house per year.&nbsp; <br /><br />Nick<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Is that $50/yr for support or is that $50/yr to run the OS and if after a year that OS won&#039;t work anymore? To be honest, I don&#039;t want paid support. If I can&#039;t fix something, I turn to Google and then here. What I do want is a polished desktop, which seems to be what Novell has put together here...from the screenshots and dumps I&#039;ve seen.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">As far as their version 9 desktop, I think licensing states that you have to pay $50 per year to even use it (although it won&#039;t stop working without a license, right now you just have to have a valid license to use their online update tools, get security patches, etc.)&nbsp; I guess you could always just install the evaluation version and not get updates.<br /><br />Nick<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Saw this post as I was searching for some Xgl info on SLED 10.<br />I happen to work for Novell and happen to be originally from Pensacola...figured I&#039;d chime in on the question. Unfortunately I don&#039;t get back there very often, but would like to have a reason to...<br /><br />SLED 10 will be shipped most likely in August. Don&#039;t have official pricing, but currently NLD9 is $50/user. OpenSUSE is our opensourced equivalent and while it won&#039;t have anything that is licensed, it will have most of the goodies and you can download it from opensuse.org at no cost. You can also download the latest beta builds of SUSE 10.1 from there (basis for SLED10). We&#039;re currently at beta9 with roughly 3-4 more before going into release candidates in early May. Beta 9 looks good and each released build is making significant progress.<br /><br />Hope that helps.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Still working on it. At this point we don&#039;t have any beta packages packaged up. Only what&#039;s downloadable via opensuse.org. There will be a public beta at or around RC1 which is expected in May (still talking SLED10 here). We distributed some packages of beta8 at Brainshare and I&#039;m trying to track some down, but I won&#039;t be able to get them to you in time.<br /><br />I can send over a beta9 DVD to someone for your install fest on Saturday if you wish. Reply offlist with the appropriate address and contact name.</div>
