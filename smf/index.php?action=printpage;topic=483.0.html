					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, it seems that my old login got screwed up, so I'm reborn as Ruggy. I'm back from the desert and working on getting my life back on track. Unfortunately, I'm having to use a friend's computer and being forced to use WinXP. Sorry to add bad tally's to the log, but I will be around none-the-less. <br /><br />Later,<br />Daniel</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just want to stress to everyone how nice it is to have unfiltered web access, cable TV, AIM, IRC and broadband internet. It's too bad that I'm broke or else I would be enjoying a few beers, but I'll take what I've got. &nbsp;:)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It's hard to believe that I made this post a year ago. Once again, I have returned from overseas safely and this year is sooo much better than the last.<br /><br />Just to re-emphasize what I said before<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: I</div><div class="quote"><br />I just want to stress to everyone how nice it is to have unfiltered web access, cable TV, AIM, IRC and broadband internet.</div><br />While I had AIM over there this time, I have a new appreciation of showers, real toilets, grass and loud noises not being explosions. One big difference over last year is I'm not broke this time and I can afford beer.<br /><br />I hope we get the server situation worked out and if you guys need any help, I think I've got some hardware I can donate and I've got quite a bit of free time right now, if you need any help getting services configured.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I was reading the thread from the beginning and thought that this was new. When you mentioned that your login was messed up, I thought &quot;Not again!&quot;. Glad to see you back. When will you physically be here in Pcola?</div>
