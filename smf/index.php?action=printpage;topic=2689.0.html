					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am looking to buy a KVM Switch so I do not have to purchase another Monitor for a new linux box I am setting up.&nbsp; Does anyone here use one and do you have any problem with them?<br /><br />I am looking at purchasing this one:&nbsp; http://www.kvm-switches-online.com/gcs62.html<br /><br />Lee</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">My KVM switch is just PS/2 like the one you mention. Now that I have an USB based keyboard and mouse (yes they will work with PS/2, but I don&#039;t want to use it that way) I wished I hade one that supported USB as well.<br /><br />I had problems with mine in that I would lose my mouse when switching. Which necesitated 2 mice. The one you mention is &quot;powered.&quot; I think that takes care of the problem I was having. But you may want to check around. <br /><br />Check out this thread (http://www.pcolalug.org/smf/index.php?topic=2498.0) to see if there is anything that might be a help to you. I don&#039;t remember if there were any gems in there that would give a hint as to what to look for and what to stay away from.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If the only problem was the possibility of needing two mice.&nbsp; I will take that any day over loosing space and purchasing another monitor and keyboard.<br /><br />Thanks dpeach for your input.<br /><br />Lee</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This (http://www.linxcelusa.com/proditem/item/viewPrd.asp?idproduct=19) is the KVM I use. It&#039;s a pretty simple 2xPS/2, USB, VGA kvm with 6ft cables built in. I use it with a PS/2 keyboard and my Logitech MX1000 using USB between two systems. I like it because it&#039;s small and has worked flawlessly. I got mine on ebay for somewhere around $20 I believe.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I bought one made by Manhatten at Southeastern Computers on 29.&nbsp; I use it with one machine running Windows 2000 Pro and the other running SuSe 9.3.&nbsp; The switch works flawlessly and my Logitech optical mouse works with both computers.&nbsp; One feature I like is you can swith between computers by hitting the scroll-lock key twice.&nbsp; That starts to scan between the PC&#039;s and you can lock in the one you want by hitting the ESC key.&nbsp; It also has the ability to hook up your computer sound.<br /><br />Blessings,<br /><br />Pete</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I ended up purchasing a linksys 2 port KVM.&nbsp; It is working great.&nbsp; So far I have not had any issues. I am using only one mouse as well.&nbsp; Now, to get my newly acquired (free) computer all configured.&nbsp; &nbsp;AMD 1900+ with 1 gig of ram.&nbsp; Got to love it when is free&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />Lee</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for the follow up. Which Linksys KVM is it? Does it have it&#039;s own power supply? Does it have USB?<br /><br />Thanks, just curious.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">http://www1.linksys.com/products/product.asp?grid=36&amp;scid=45&amp;prid=502 is the one I got.   I needed the ps2 version.  It does not have its own power supply.&nbsp; They make a usb version as well.  So far I have not had any problems with it.  I will give it a week of heavy switching and post a follow up.<br /><br />Lee</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for the follow-up reports, Lee.&nbsp; I sometimes think I need one of these, and it&#039;s good to have a ready reference of something that works well.&nbsp; I may be coming back to this thread when I convince myself to get one.<br /><br />Dan<br /><br />(...who is still in the process of moving...&nbsp; in case you didn&#039;t know it, moving is NOT fun...&nbsp; &nbsp;:( )<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just thought I would let everyone that is thinking about getting a KVM switch.&nbsp; Walmart on &quot;Creighton&quot; has an &quot;I/O Gear&quot; KVM switch for $26 bucks.&nbsp; That is $12 bucks less than what I paid for mine a few months ago at Tech Advanced.&nbsp; I did not see it until a month or so after I had made my purchase.<br /><br />Lee</div>
