					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Alright, I'm trying to get Samba running on my Slack 10.0 box. &nbsp;I just ran swaret --upgrade samba and that made it 3.0.5 and that's about as far as I've gotten. &nbsp;I have a WindowsXP and Linux box both on the network. &nbsp;I don't know if Slack 10.0 uses inted or the newer xinetd (I think that's what it's called) but I'm pretty positive it's inted.<br /><br /><br />The two lines about smbd and nmbd are commented out in /etc/inted.conf but says that if I'm using rc.samba in /etc/rd.d that they should be. &nbsp;Well, I've got that rc.samba file but I can't see samba running when I'm root and I do either a ps -x or a ps -A, nothing resembling smbd or nmbd is up. &nbsp;Also probably because of this the SWAT program doesn't work, going to localhost:901 is refused. &nbsp;Please help me out here in the beginning, I don't want to screw it up...again.<br /><br />Basically I'm wondering if I need to make a &quot;stock&quot; smb.conf anyway and work off of that, if SWAT automatically makes one that I'll modify with it, and how I can tell if smbd and nmbd are up. &nbsp;Then I'll follow the howto some more and let you know how that goes.<br /><br /><br />Oh, the WindowsXP box is Pro, not Home, than the gods.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, the fun has started. &nbsp;I've got Samba up and running, surprisingly, by editing my inetd.conf and enabling swat, smbd, and nmbd. &nbsp;After a reboot SWAT actually works which I am shocked with given that it has NEVER worked on any other box of mine. &nbsp;Go figure.<br /><br /><br />Anyway, apparently the WindowsXP box can see the shares as it should, now I just need to get it going the other way. &nbsp;Any suggestions on a network shares browser with KDE? &nbsp;I seem to remember something called &quot;Samba 2003&quot; or something but can't remember. &nbsp;Seems odd this kind of thing wouldn't be built-in by now after all these years of using samba.<br /><br />EDIT: &nbsp;nevermind, apparently you can have Konqueror access them by using &quot;smb://.&quot; While that's all well and good I find myself missing the simple and straightforward &quot;View Workgroup Computers&quot; and such. &nbsp;Hmm, maybe there's a front-end I can use to make that a little easier. &nbsp;Guess we'll see.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hmm, this is interesting. &nbsp;From the Windows box I see two folders on Anubis: &nbsp;&quot;homes&quot; and &quot;foxx.&quot; One would assume that to view the folder &quot;homes&quot; I would click on &quot;homes&quot; right? &nbsp;Wrong. &nbsp;I try to do that and the network isn't accessible. &nbsp;However, strangely, if I go to the folder &quot;foxx&quot; I get to /home on Anubis. &nbsp;Weird, real weird. &nbsp;Since it's even halfway working right now I'm not goign to worry too much but still, real f'ing weird.</div>
