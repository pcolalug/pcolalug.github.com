					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello All,<br /><br />I am brand new to Linux, competent in DOS (I miss DOS), enjoy HTML, used to be a good programmer with Turbo Pascal, handy with Windows XX, and have a small background in Unix. &nbsp;My Brother is an active member of your group and has a habit of leading me down the dark and winding road to new computer experiences. &nbsp;However, after I fall into deep water, he always yanks me back out and teaches me something new. &nbsp;I remember deleting command.com once way back in my early days, discovered my computer did not like that, called him on the phone and got a fine lecture. &nbsp;So.....here I am. &nbsp;I intend to quietly observe your posts until I understand enough Linux to contribute. &nbsp;Here we go again......<br /><br />Narsil</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Glad to have you Narsil. Do you want to claim who your brother is, or would you prefer to not be too closely associated with him?<br /><br />You can help us out. We need people posting newbie questions so that we can show off our expertise. No, not really. But we do need questions that we could answer for other people to benefit from. We would like to populate this board with questions and answers that will help others. That is assuming that people know how to use the search feature.<br /><br />Welcome.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for the warm welcome. &nbsp;In response to your question, my brother is Dan C. &nbsp;I keep trying to find something that Linux can't do that Windows can. &nbsp;So far Linux seems to be holding its own. &nbsp;Have not tested things yet, just been reading some stuff out there on the net. &nbsp;Maybe this Linux stuff really is as good as Dan tells me it is......at least Mandrake has not caused my machine to burn down yet......GRIN. &nbsp;Thank you all for offering this page to the public, it is well done and appreciated. &nbsp;Here is my very first Linux question to the group....Does this &quot;post a reply&quot; function have a spell checker??<br /><br />Narsil</div>

Boy, I wish it did. Sometimes I go back and read some of my posts and wonder what everyone thinks about my education as badly as I mispell some words.<br /><br />Of course I also judge others based on how well they do, or do not, spell.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: Narsil</div><div class="quote">I keep trying to find something that Linux can't do that Windows can. So far Linux seems to be holding its own.</div><br />There are some things that Linux can do better than Windows, and some things that Windows can do more easily than Linux. They both have their advantages. I think most in here would admit that we are using Linux and Windows for different tasks. A couple have made Linux their only OS, which proves that it is possible.</div>
