					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Your best bet is probably to set it up with CUPS. &nbsp;This is probably already installed, and you can find out by trying this address in your browser:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">localhost&#58;631</div><br />If that brings up the CUPS interface, go to &quot;Administration&quot; and then &quot;Add Printer&quot;. &nbsp;If asked for a login, use the name &quot;root&quot; and your root password. &nbsp;Then follow the prompts, should be fairly straightforward.<br /><br />Be advised that as far as I know, Lexmark is one of the most poorly supported printers there are, and you may not have much luck with it. &nbsp;If you feel like replacing it, you generally can't go wrong with a Hewlett Packard model...<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">LinuxPrinting.org (http://www.linuxprinting.org/) is the best resource for getting printing setup. Don't let all the talk of spools, queues and everything else freak you out. It is all pretty straight forward once you get CUPS installed and have your driver in place.<br /><br />Here (http://www.linuxprinting.org/show_printer.cgi?recnum=Lexmark-Z32) is the listing for your printer from the foomatic db. There is an open driver out there that works partially and there are closed source, binary drivers from Lexmark. Chances are, you will get better results from the Lexmark drivers, provided you aren't running Debian Woody (or so the editor says it doesn't work).<br /><br />Oh, one more thing, you may need to enable CUPS in your inetd (or xinetd). It may be installed, but it is probably disabled by default.</div>
