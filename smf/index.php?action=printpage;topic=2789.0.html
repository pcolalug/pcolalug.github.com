					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just got done reading an awesome article over at Firing Squad (http://www.firingsquad.com/games/enemy_territory_quake_wars_preview/default.asp) on Splash Damage&#039;s (http://www.splashdamage.com/) upcoming release Enemy Territory: Quake Wars (http://www.enemyterritory.com/). Many many hours have been spent by us fragging each other in Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, and from the looks of what&#039;s coming, we are in for many more hours of much more rich gameplay.<br /><br />(http://www.firingsquad.com/games/enemy_territory_quake_wars_preview/images/10.jpg)<br /><br />I, for one, welcome our new Strogg overlords.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would assume this considering Linux versions of Doom 3 and Quake 4 were both released very quickly after the main release. Since Quake, Id has been given us Linux binaries, so why should they stop now? Splash Damage gave us Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory and considering the Doom 3 engine already runs on Linux, it would seem to be trivial to make it work with Linux. Why wouldn&#039;t they give us Enemy Territory: Quake Wars? I think the fact Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory is available for Linux is the major force that continues to drive its popularity to this day, especially considering how dated it is.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sweet!&nbsp; Game looks nice. <br /><br />As for ET&#039;s popularity among Linux players, i think about 50% or more of the Firehouse regulars are Linux users.&nbsp; <br /><br />=D<br />Ian</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yeah, Duke4 is 3DRealms. Splash Damage is another dev house. They work with Id, but Id owns the Quake and Doom franchise. Sort of like how Counter-Strike was originally developed by a seperate entity from Valve, but different in that Valve absorbed them. Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory is a mod on RTCW, released by the same publisher, Activision.</div>
