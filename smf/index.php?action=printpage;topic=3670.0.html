					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This distro is everything i could ever want, however it would format the hard drive forever &amp; never get beyond that...using the entire drive and not even dealing with the dual boot thing.....actually, my cheapo acer aspire 5515 laptop with built in wifi did not like going online except with fedora and mandriva....but I need audio &amp; video editing (please don&#039;t make me compile....)<br /><br />So it looks like: <br />1) install on the hd a rpm based distro (fedora or mandriva), go online &amp; screw the video editing (kde installed but not sure if that could be an issue)<br />2) install ubuntu multimedia &amp; cannot get online<br />3) run av linux from cd only &amp; get online &amp; get all the multimedia programs I could wish for....<br /><br />Yes, I did scrub the vista basic bs....WHEN DID YOU SAY THE NEXT MEETING WAS? :)<br /><br />I&#039;m in mossy head, land of the lost (as it is)<br /><br />Lee</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hmmm.&nbsp; Have you tried formatting and partitioning the hard drive from another live distro and then trying to install AV Linux?&nbsp; (skip the format/partition process in AV, since it&#039;s already done)<br /><br />Also, what kind of wi-fi card does your laptop have?&nbsp; I thought most of the major distros out there already had support for most wireless cards.<br /><br /><br />The next quarterly meeting is currently scheduled for April 17.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I will be there this time! - built in wifi, I&#039;d have to look, but Fedora &amp; Mandriva install to the HD &amp; find by cheesy connection without a problem....Ubuntu, Debian, and any variations installed....nada.<br /><br />I will try skipping the formatting....<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I finally installed the 9.10 cd that came with a programing magazine from Linux format, I&#039;m all WI-FI&#039;d out now! I just installed what would have come with 64 studio or av linux....<br /><br />I&#039;ll still try to make the april 17 meeting (did I miss something or is there no news about the march meeting?)<br /><br />Lee</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Glad to hear things worked out with your distro.<br /><br />As for the meetings, we are still on for April, though you may want to check out the new discussion. &nbsp;Our meetings are on a quarterly schedule now, meaning we have meetings in January, April, July, and October.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Don&#039;t quote me on this, but I think the most popular distro is Ubuntu (&amp; its derivatives) followed by Slackware.</div>
