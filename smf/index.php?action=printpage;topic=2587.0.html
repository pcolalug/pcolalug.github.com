					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The release of Slackware 10.2 is very close. &nbsp;From the Changelog:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">OK folks, this is just about ready to go. Consider nearly everything to be set in stone at this point, especially the kernels. Zipslack has yet to be built, and some of the documentation needs minor updating, but for the most part this is how Slackware 10.2 is going to look. Expect a release to happen sometime within the next week or so.</div><br /><br />On a related note, there are many other iminent releases of other distros going on too, including Mandriva, Suse, and Ubuntu. &nbsp;Lots of details available here: &nbsp;http://www.distrowatch.com<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yay! I love release time. It gives me things to play with until I figure out they haven't changed much at all! This is all very exciting considering Gnome 2.12 was just released this week as well.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Gnome 2.12 packages are in Ubuntu Breezy already, so far working great.<br /><br />On an slightly unrelated note, I installed Windows 2003 on my computer to test out some software, and it's embarrasing how slow Linux boots compared to Mac OSX or Windows on identical hardware :( &nbsp;There's gotta be some way to improve that :)<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Linux boots slow? &nbsp;Really?<br /><br />My w2k install takes at least 90 seconds to boot, probobly closer to 2 min.<br /><br />My slackware install on the other hand takes just 17 seconds to boot. &nbsp; How long does mac osx take to boot again?<br /><br />And this is without heavy modification either. &nbsp;I would love to sync up gentoo or debian with minit and see how low i could get it. &nbsp;(minit uses sysV).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">My Debian install boots very slowly compared to Windows XP on the same system. I know Gentoo has a method to initialize multiple things are once, but I haven't really looked into it for any other distro. The parallel initialization did speed things up considerably, but I have found that the slowest part of my systems boot process is mounting the filesystems. Here is my layout...<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">/dev/hda1 &nbsp;ext3 &nbsp;456M &nbsp;41% &nbsp;/<br />/dev/hda2 &nbsp;ext3 &nbsp;228M &nbsp;9% &nbsp;/boot<br />/dev/hda10 &nbsp;reiserfs &nbsp;99G &nbsp;5% &nbsp;/home<br />/dev/hda7 &nbsp;reiserfs &nbsp;2.8G 5% /opt<br />/dev/hda8 &nbsp;reiserfs &nbsp;2.8G 2% /srv<br />/dev/hda6 &nbsp;reiserfs &nbsp;4.7G 1% /tmp<br />/dev/hda9 &nbsp;reiserfs &nbsp;14G 15% /usr<br />/dev/hda5 &nbsp;reiserfs &nbsp;4.7G 49% /var<br />/dev/hdb1 &nbsp;ext3 &nbsp;184G 55% /media/storage</div><br /><br />It takes about 20 to 30 seconds to check the reiser filesystems and then mount them. It's unreal. Once those get done, gdm is up within ten to fifteen seconds.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I guess I am comparing to some of the slowest booting distro's around. &nbsp;I've been using Debian (Ubuntu) and SuSE mostly for the last few months. &nbsp;<br /><br />I don't have a clock / watch handy to test it right now but it seems like Ubuntu takes about twice as long as Windows 2003 to boot, and Windows 2003 takes more than twice as long as Mac OSX on the same machine. &nbsp;<br /><br />I remember some talk on the ubuntu dev forums a while back about implementing a parallelized bootup for Breezy but it looks like that never happened.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ran across this article on Distrowatch, which talks about some excellent boot time improvements in the upcoming Mandriva release:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">What an exciting week this was! Besides a stable release of GNOME 2.12 and a beta version of Firefox 1.5, four major Linux distributions have entered the final stages of their development cycles - Mandriva Linux 2006, Slackware Linux 10.2, SUSE Linux 10.0 and Ubuntu Linux 5.10. Of these, which one is going to be the winner? While Ubuntu seems like a distribution with the most new features, it is Mandriva's latest beta release that caught our attention during the past week. The reason? The breathtaking boot speed.<br /><br />That's right - while many distributions have been talking about speeding up the boot process, an area where no Linux distribution compares favourably with Microsoft Windows, it seems that the developers of Mandriva did not just talk - they simply did it! And the result? On our Pentium 4 test box with 384MB of RAM, Mandriva 2006 RC1 takes 23 seconds to boot into the console login prompt, and 52 seconds into full KDE (bypassing the KDM login screen)! This is a remarkable achievement when compared to SUSE Linux 10.0 RC1, which takes 108 seconds to boot into KDE, or Fedora Core, which needs 76 seconds to boot into GNOME on the same system.</div><br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Wow!<br /><br />23 seconds would be about par for slackware (on my machine). &nbsp;But it's absolutely <b>blazing</b> for mandrake. &nbsp;Especially considering how many extra services mandrake starts at boot.<br /><br />I would like to know how they did this, because it certianly wouldn't be easy.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: Brent</div><div class="quote">I would like to know how they did this, because it certianly wouldn't be easy.</div><br /><br />The basic idea is to let multiple services startup concurrently in the background instead of waiting for 1 to start, then starting 2, then starting 3...<br /><br />For example on my machine, it takes about 10 seconds for the network cards to all pull DHCP information. &nbsp;By letting those happen in the background, other startup tasks don't have to wait on it, right there would save 10 seconds off my boot time.<br /><br />Nick</div>
