					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I just finished my install of Gentoo Linux yesterday. It was suprisingly easy since I now have a bit more than rudimentary knowledge of Linux.<br /><br /><br />I just have to say that Gentoo Linux is one of the most robust and all around pleasing distributions that I have tried yet. The portage feature makes the headache of installing packages go away, and I love all the little features<br /><br /><br />Anyone fed up with the crappiness of Red Hat or the other commercialized distros should defniitely give this one a try<br /><br />One warning however, Gentoo is a bit more unforgiving during the install than your candy coated RH or Mandrake. Not quite as steep a curve as Slackware, but definitely not for the garden variety Linux user</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Finally! I could kiss you right about now. Its been a while since someone posted a positive Gentoo comment. I've been using it full time for a couple of months now, and I don't think I could go back to a binary-based distro.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well let me know how you feel after installing java. &nbsp;Mine's been compiling for 5.5 hours now, AMD 1700+XP. &nbsp;:(<br /><br />(On FreeBSD though. &nbsp;We like to compile most of our own programs too.)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Does compiling software really get in the way? I mean, yes, it did take me about 36 straight hours of compiling to get the desktop/java set up (USE flags are the shizznit). But once everything is up and running (say, after a weekend), I wait for nothing.<br /><br />What I do is [ctl]-[alt]-[f2] over to a vtty and run<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">sudo `emerge sync` &amp;&amp; `emerge -u --deep world`</div><br />then hop back over to KDE ([ctl]-[alt]-[f7], natch) and continue on with what I'm doing while portage takes care of the rest. Occasionally, a browser will scroll a little jumpy, but it really doesn't get in the way too much.<br /><br />BTW, if you're curious, I run an Athlon XP 2000+ with 1024M of ram.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I hate waiting for compiles and I like to be running latest release, I guess that's why Slackware Dropline works for me, keeps me up-to-date with reasonably optimized compiled packages.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am happy to see people posting positive comments about gentoo. I also think it is a awesome distro. Of course, i am still a linux noob. I started on slack9 about 8 months ago. I tried gentoo for the first time on a virtual machine when i had only been using slack for like a month or so. I have used &nbsp;gentoo since. It is great, the more i learn about *NIX systems the more i like gentoo. As for it not being easy to install, I was a complete noob and between the irc channel and online instructions i managed to get it installed and learned a whole hell of a lot about linux at the same time. I have it on a old amd-k6 500Mhz machine also. Yeah it takes a while but if you install from stage 1, it is so worth it. You can set the USE flags to compile everything for your specific processor's instruction set. It runs smoother than anything i have seen. Of course i have only seen Red Crap, slack, and solaris so i cant say i am that experienced. I have a friend setting up a gentoo server at FSU he will run performance tests on against a solaris and slack server. When i get the results i will be sure to post them.<br />GENTOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I want to try Gentoo. Now that I have found out that my processor is Hyperthread enabled, I want to see how well it will work...if linux supports hyperthreading that is.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, it's been a productive weekend. &nbsp;Just finished installing Gentoo, and I must say that I'm impressed (and kind of proud of myself!). &nbsp;I did the Stage 3 tarball install, and so far I've got the base system, XFree, and Gnome (including Mozilla) running. &nbsp;One little glitch I had was with the nVidia drivers - you have to have the &quot;MTTR&quot; flag enabled in the kernel for it to work, so I had to re-compile my kernel again to fix that.<br /><br />Still have some to learn about the options for &quot;emerge&quot;, but it sure is slick. &nbsp;This thing boots up faster than anything I've seen, and the desktop seems very fast for everything. &nbsp;Looking forward to getting some more apps installed. &nbsp;All in all, it was not as hard as I thought it was going to be, largely due to the EXCELLENT online docs at the Gentoo website. &nbsp;Just outstanding. &nbsp;The whole install was fun, and a great learning experience. &nbsp;If you've been thinking you should try Gentoo, go for it! &nbsp; :D <br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">gentoo is great. if you are interested in optimizing your system even more, then read this about benchmarking http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/performance.xml<br /><br />and once you are enthusiastic about prelinking, read more here: http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/prelink-howto.xml<br /><br />i am amazed at the benchmarks and how much faster things run.</div>
