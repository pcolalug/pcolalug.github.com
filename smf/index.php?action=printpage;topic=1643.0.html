					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Programming with QT<br />Matthias Kalle Dalheimer<br /><br />When getting this book, I was expecting more of a hand holding, get your feet wet introduction to programming for QT geared towards the programmer who is looking to move from console programming to GUI applications. Unfortunately, that was not the case. While there is the &quot;required&quot; &quot;hello world&quot; example in chapter 2, most of the text examples given are in terms of how you would have done things using other frameworks. For someone like myself who has programmed in C++ before, but not utilizing other frameworks such as Motif, this is very frustrating since I had no way of understanding the concepts as they were presented. <br /><br />This fact brings me to the opinion that: If you are looking for a beginning HowTo book for QT and have no other GUI framework experience, look elsewhere. However, if you do have experience and can make the connections that the author makes in chapters 1-3, then this book appears to be a great transition guide into using QT.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Amazon and the like will be fine. If you'd like, you could even take a look at /.'s review guidelines and post it there. danc usually posts reviews there, and its a hoot to watch the folks bicker.</div>
