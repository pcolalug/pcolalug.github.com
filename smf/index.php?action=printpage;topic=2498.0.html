					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm going to be getting a linux box for my office at work. &nbsp;I'd like to be able to use my same keyboard, mouse, and monitor so I was thinking of hooking up a KVM switch. &nbsp;One computer will be running Windows 2000 and the other Linux. &nbsp;Will any KVM switch work with both or do I need something special?<br /><br />I don't want to purchase anything without asking for advice.<br /><br />I'll be running either SuSe or Mandrake...haven't yet decided which distro.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Any KVM <i>should</i> work for you between the 2 OSes. The OSes will not be the problem from what I understand. It will be hardware related.<br /><br />The only thing that I know you need to be careful about is keeping your mouse working between switches. When I used a KVM and switched to the other computer, my mouse would stop working. Interestingly, this has only happened with my newer computers, not my older ones. So, I suspect that there is something with the way the PS/2 port works in newer machines. I have read about this quite a bit in the last 2 years, but never followed it out to a solution.<br /><br />I believe Rugmonster may have some input in this area. But until you hear from him, or someone else, do some looking to see if the KVM needs to be a powered one, or what might be the problem. <br /><br />If you are using all USB components, then the issues may be different.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have found the KVMs, as a whole, suck, unless you spend a lot of money. I have settled with one that doesn't suck quite as bad as some of the others I've tried. Basically, the problem I have run into in trying to run a Logitech MX1000 (native USB mouse) is that most KVMs don't support the extensions to the signals that are sent through it. I tried a belkin, a d-link and now have some off-brand kvm that includes usb support. So, if you have a PS/2 mouse and you have a scroll wheel, make sure the KVM will support it. I would also recommend finding one that has cables built in, or you will spend a lot of money on video and ps/2 cables. Other than that, the world of KVMs is sort of flakey. Get as much information about the product as possible before buying and be ready to throw a couple away.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have a belkin with usb support. I use belken or raritan for racked servers. Belkin or Blackbox for desktops.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I will get the model number of the belkin when I get back to the office next week, they seem to work pretty well for me. &nbsp;Using a ps2 to usb convert with my black box kvm I lose the scroll on my mouse.</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">We ended up buying one from Southeastern up on 29. &nbsp;It is made by Manhattan. &nbsp;Supposedly it will handle two computers and also lets you use your speakers too.<br /><br />Switch between machines by typing ctrl-scrolllock-scrolllock.<br /><br />I hope Rugmonster's prediction of having to go through multiple KVM switches to find one that works does not come true :?</div>
