					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">No no, TV comes today. &nbsp;First delivery time is in an hour, we'll see how that goes.<br /><br />Wife also has some surgery today I need to take her to, unfortunately (means I'm REALLY hoping the delivery guys drop by beforehand).<br /><br /><br />But yeah, my neighbor is awesome, has been very kind to us and just isn't knowledgable about automotive things. &nbsp;She was actually going to dish out $450 to do her front brakes and another $400 for ****** tires. &nbsp;Oh yeah, I was ticked when all four brakes cost me about $50 and two hours and new tires that whop the living **** out of their competitors cost me around $150 for all four (gotta love Kumho Ecstas). &nbsp;For her truck we could get some Yokohama Geolanders for less than $400 brand new and they'll rock that little S-10 more than a heavy metal concert in the truck bed.<br /><br />But you've gotta help your neighbors out when they're in need, especially if they're nice to you. &nbsp;It's your duty, ya know?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sunday involved various &quot;activities&quot; with the wife I won't go into, Saturday morning was brakes, Saturday evening at 5pm we had a dinner scheduled with Haldemann, and Monday I sat around all day by the front door for a delivery guy that never showed up.<br /><br />I'd tell you the whole sad tale but suffice it to say that 30 mins ago I got a call from my wife who luckily had the day off who said the TV is there now without a scratch and I heavily advise EVERYONE to NOT use Manna Distribution Services. &nbsp;EVER.<br /><br />I'm going to have a lot of fun burning them for this one. &nbsp;Again, to make a long story short, it's justified.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Man, tell us where she wanted to go so we can avoid that place! &nbsp;For the cost of brake pads and 20 minutes per wheel (30 or so for back drum brakes), the job can be done easily.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Pretty much ANYONE around here in Fort Walton, Niceville, and Shalimar is like that but most notably Niceville Tire and Auto Service Center, Sears, and a few other people.<br /><br />Since I'm mentioning it, I might as well also mention to NOT have your alignment done at Sears if you can't help it. &nbsp;I lowered my vehicle with Monroe Sensatrac Struts (high quality) paired with some Eibach springs (also high quality) a very modest amount, only 1.3&quot;. &nbsp;They told me that if they did the alignment and it was wrong that they had no obligation to fix it because I was using aftermarket parts. &nbsp;Excuse me, but since when would a lowering job make an alignment suddenly &quot;go out?&quot; Never. &nbsp;It has nothing to do with it because once the struts are in it stays that way; the only thing that would affect it would be if a screw or three suddenly came loose and then an alignment is going to be the LEAST of your worries.<br /><br /><br />Just total and utter BS. &nbsp;I tend to be forgiving of a lot of things, but a dishonest/lazy mechanic is NOT one of them. &nbsp;You entrust your life to that vehicle every time you get in it, your LIFE, which means that someone that works on it should NOT overcharge you OR do a shoddy job. &nbsp;End of story.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sorry about that, back to Knoppix! &nbsp;:lol:</div>
