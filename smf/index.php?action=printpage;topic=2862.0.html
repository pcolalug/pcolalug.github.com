					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">In case you missed it on /., an eweek article (http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1954198,00.asp?kc=ewnws042706dtx1k0000599) is reporting that for the first time employers are paying non-certified employees more than certified employees. This goes to show that employers are becoming more aware that just because you have a piece of paper, doesn&#039;t mean you know the job, nor you are flexible to new technologies. I&#039;ve long been a believer that a broad understanding of the core concepts of your given area of expertise is much more valuable that knowing a specific application. I have taken certification tests and I have studied for ones that I never took and it there are rarely any questions that are more than regurgitation of facts.<br /><br />If you really want to get a job in IT, don&#039;t waste your money on certifications. Learn the basics and go from there. If an employer really wants you to have a cert, they&#039;ll pay for the test, if not the training or study material.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yup, I paid like 80 bucks when I was still in highschool for books on A+/N+ Certification, because I wanted a pc/net tech job, and the few companies that were in IT required it.&nbsp; I almost forked over $400 for the two tests, but since that was nearly a months pay, I decided against paying for the certs myself.<br /><br />What kills me is the number of menial dead end computer jobs that *require* a 4 year degree.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t mind taking a low level sys admin job just to get me by for a while, but eventually, I&#039;m gona want a job that gives me some really good experience with current hardware and software development.&nbsp; If you&#039;re not learning anything new on the job, you&#039;re wasting your time (from my perspective).&nbsp; The only way I see to avoid the &#039;entry level&#039; crunch upon graduation, is to have a couple years of coop experience to back me up.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Brent, I still see a lot of jobs asking for certs. I also see, like you say, bachlors for an entry level tech job. This is HR being lazy or lacking knowledge. So that HR doesn&#039;t look bad they put high requirements for the jobs. That way if a dud slips through, they can say it wasn&#039;t thier fault. It goes back to my therory, you need connections. There is also a catch 22, you need the cert. to get an interview, but you really need experience to get the cert. Thats what I fell into. Then no one hires me anyway, HA!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have always been a believer that paper is worthless.&nbsp; I have one cert and a BA.&nbsp; My BA is in history/anthropology, yet I&#039;m doing very well in the technology field.&nbsp; That&#039;s simply because some people see value in getting things done rather than having a piece of paper. I am one of those people.&nbsp; This job doesn&#039;t require even an AA, though if you do not have a two-year, equivalent experience is required.<br /><br />I&#039;ll not rehash my full post here for the job we currently have (http://www.pcolalug.org/smf/index.php?topic=2971.0), but I can tell you that this job is for an entry level sys admin who really wants to learn.&nbsp; We&#039;ll be doing everything from Server 2k3 to redhat enterprise 4, dns, samba as domain controller, php/mysql programming, flash website design, enterprise-style imaging (image 300 computers in two days over two campuses. . .i&#039;ve done it . .alone . and without stress), VoIP, Cisco access lists, vlans, security sweeps, etc etc.<br /><br />Job deadline is Sept 6 (this coming wednesday).&nbsp; check the thread for more details.&nbsp; </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I guess paper in a way is worthless but with no paper you will not get an interview!!!! I think certs help backup whats in your resume.&nbsp; I like think of them as the poor mans degree. I know they do not compare to a degree, but at seven or eight dollars an hour I don&#039;t see myself with a family and bills going back to school for four years. I do see a possibility of maybe doing the Solaris Admin certs. <br />I recently put down ceramic tile, carpet, new counter top, installed ten custom windows, removed an old heater, plastered, painted the whole house, unplugged the plumbing, replaced all the seals in all faucets and toilet, replaced bad outlets, repaired light fixtures in a rental property. Good for me! Now if I went and applied for a job as a maintenance person they would throw me out in the street.... where is my license and formal training and years of experience. <br />I think it comes down to the individual person doing the hiring and what they like and connections.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I understand what you are saying, but I have found that certified techs tend to know less than techs without certs, given that they have the same years of experience.&nbsp; I tend to prefer non-certified to certified typically, though you always judge by the individual, not by the pieces of paper.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure why this is . .unless perhaps the certs give you step by step instructions and not having certs forces you to actually understand the process a bit better, given that both people are doing the same task.&nbsp; The certified individual tends to understand less, and therefore be able to DO less, but be able to spit out all kinds of fancy terms.<br /><br />I do NOT knock education by any means.&nbsp; I took one upper level MIS course in college:&nbsp; Networking Theory.&nbsp; It has helped my understanding of what actually happens on an ethernet segment immensely and made it easy to understand vlans, etc. later on in my career and I&#039;m sure I could benefit from additional certs (the forced studying, not the actual test), but I feel that the best course of action is to DO the job for a while (2-3 years?) before actually getting the certs.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know a Cisco instructor who was fully certified (but have never &quot;done the job&quot;) who didn&#039;t know what a console port was and had no understanding of subnets.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I didn&#039;t want to come accross in a bad way. I have been unemployed for awhile and its caused me to be a bit critical of HR types. They usually have no technical background so they protect themselfs with crazy requirements for entry level jobs. I know every employer wants to hire people with Doctorates for 5.25, thats cool, but I know I&#039;ll never be able to compete. I think this area has an over abundence of technical people and few jobs. So employers get hammered with a flood of applicant, so the easy way to cut down is again high requirements for the jobs.<br />&nbsp;I looked at your requirements above, for your entry level job and there is no way I would apply. I feel with some time I could do ok, but&nbsp; employers want people that require absolutely no training, time is money!&nbsp; After thirteen months I have about given up on getting back in any IT job. So Home Depot here I come!!!!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Certs/degrees are what help you get through HR. A good IT manager shouldn&#039;t care as much about what pieces of paper a person has and be able to tell whether or not the applicant is capable of the job. Are they smart? What kind of background do they have? Can they learn new things quickly? Do they have a good base of knowledge?<br /><br />Where most IT certifications go wrong is anyone can go take the test. There are some that require a level of experience prior to taking the test, and those are the ones with the most value. The market has changed since 2000 though and people who are doing hiring aren&#039;t as desperate as they were before. They know the difference between someone that knows what they&#039;re doing and some Joe that did sales and then got his MCSE because there was good money in IT.<br /><br />There are times when companies have a requirement for folks with certain certifications. The DoD and contractors of the DoD are now coming under a new policy that certain positions REQUIRE some sort of professional certification, uniformed personnel included. That&#039;s why I was sent to the SANS class. <br /><br />alan, if you&#039;re having a hard time finding a job due to lack of experience or knowledge, try looking into private consulting. Since I don&#039;t get to work with unix/linux enough in my regular job, I am bolstering the experience I can list on my resume with consulting work. The bonus is that I get paid well doing it and don&#039;t have to put much time into it. I work as much as I like and it ends up being pretty much a win/win for me.<br /><br />Also, you aren&#039;t going to hurt any feelings by applying for jobs that you don&#039;t really fit all of the requirements on. A lot of times, when you submit a resume and you don&#039;t necessarily fit the job you are applying for, companies will look to see if there is something you may have a better fit with. If they see potential in your learning ability, then they may pick you up anyway. Provided you have a good base of knowledge, you should be able to adapt and pick up new knowledge quickly. There is always a period of time that a company expects you to adjust and learn how they do things and what they are working with.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Alan,<br /><br />The requirements for this job get me 1-2 applicants typically that know what a database is, much less how to be a db-admin.&nbsp; I usually only get 3-4 applicants total.&nbsp; I do not get a flood of applications, typically due to our location (about 1 hour north of p&#039;cola).&nbsp; If you have worked on pcs for a year or two, know what an ip address is, know that the cpu isn&#039;t the pc case and have looked at cabling and switches/hubs before, you probably have enough skills to come into this job.&nbsp; The last guy I hired had worked six months at Cox in technical support and some self-taught stuff from home.&nbsp; The items I posted above would be items you would learn in your first two years here, NOT items you would be expected to know to get the job.&nbsp; I do all the training in house.&nbsp; Granted, I&#039;m stuck for time a lot, but I don&#039;t expect you to hit the ground running (though that would be great if you could).<br /><br />I would hope that a person applying for this position would stay for a year or two (preferrably two) at least, and then I expect them to move on.&nbsp; The people that have left here that worked with me left for MUCH higher paying jobs, typically in the IT field. I wish them well and stay in contact with them.&nbsp; We help each other out.&nbsp; Some move into other areas of the college, some go back to school, but I REALLY want someone to stay a full year or two.&nbsp; Most people will have learned enough in a year to go make more money, but after two years with the title network admin (regardless of the fact that you would probably only have been doing ALL of the duties for the last year) they can go make $50k easy, especially with the reputation my department has with vendors through out the state of AL.<br /><br />If you are considering applying, do it.&nbsp; That is all.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="index.php%3Ftopic=2862.msg14686.html#msg14686">Quote from: alan on September 01, 2006, 09:39:33 am</a></div><div class="quote">I didn&#039;t want to come accross in a bad way.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">&nbsp; I do remember back in &#039;99 when I started working on my certs, its was the hay day of sorts for them. I tried to get experience and studied before I did took my tests. I guess if you have a super good memory you could take them a few times and eventually you would pass them. If you search right now, you&#039;ll find jobs asking for certs. I&#039;m not sure how to say it, HR uses them for disqualiers or qualifiers, They don&#039;t see it in the resume, &quot;reject&quot;. Some places usekey word searches too.<br />&nbsp; I usually target large DoD contractor companies trying to use my TS SCI poly clearance. Even with it ,nothing! I don&#039;t count jobs in DC and Baltimore. I like it here and want to stay. Anyway, I applied to 30+ clearance related jobs in the area and not a single call. Now I only apply to jobs that I&nbsp; have done in the past or very similar that I know I can answer interview questions. I don&#039;t do the deal where &quot;did you ever see one, well your qualified&quot; thing.<br />&nbsp; I have tried to get responces a few times from the HR people to see if I could figure out what happened, but no luck. So I have come to the conclusion either I&#039;m not really as qualifed as I think or there is something in my resume spooking the HR folks.<br />&nbsp; I did find out Home Depot will be hiring soon, they opened a new store in Pensacola and are moving people around. So there should be openings at all stores in the area. The Pace store has a new HR person &quot;5 days on the job&quot; and he is getting ready to hire and train. Well thats enough for now.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I think I&#039;ll play some Quake............</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">this is how i have survived in the tech game since getting my ba in 1993 from uwf.<br /><br />1. go where the jobs are plenty, so that if you don&#039;t have alot of experience, but hr is looking for bodies for entry level, you have a better shot. took me 2 weeks of &quot;pounding the pavement&quot; in atlanta. my manager who hired me is still a good friend today, 14 years later. he is a director of it down in o-town now. i&#039;m currently a network administrator working for a top five defense contractor on eglin. who knew??? :) when i started looking for a job back in 1993 in atlanta, I had NO local contacts, save my uncle and friends letting me crash on the couch as I hunted for employment.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t had to do that since the internet took over, and hr finds me now. :)<br /><br />2. once you are in the door. learn everything you can. i mean volunteer for the server room cleanup. sit in those dead head vendor meetings that last all day (hopefully catered). take those accounts, or customers, or jobs that no one wants to do, and SHINE in them.<br /><br />3. i&#039;m all for small biz, but you need to get some &quot;named&quot; companies, w. &quot;big&quot; projects on your resume.. i&#039;m not talking &quot;helped install outlook and repaired customers .pst&#039;s and saved their shitty small business from failing&quot;. i&#039;m talking, lead project engineer on deploying enterprise wide computer telephony integration solution and lowering tco for telecommunications infrastructre utilizing VoIP.. or even &quot;saved company x amount of dollars&quot; by &quot;integrating network faxing solutions which reduced time/energy/effort/logistics/equipment/paper/maintenance costs to the company&quot; or &quot;onsite support dba/lan/wan administrator for a Windows 2000/ASP/IIS based intranet registration solution supporting up to 200,000 processed customers within three-five days&quot; (that&#039;s one of mine btw).<br /><br />4. as for the certs. i&#039;ve run into plenty of &quot;paper tigers&quot; in my days. been burned by a couple of them, but was able to recover (thank God we backed up the ms sql database every night, but thats another story).<br /><br />5. college degree gets your foot in the door. what you do w. the job once you are in (the things BEYOND doing above and beyond in the job, such as making industry contacts, expanding your infinite network via yahoo! gmail, myspace, LinkedIn (great resource) participating in local trade or industry groups or WHATEVER) you need to CONTINUE to network w. others in your field, and find out where the jobs will be BEFORE they becone available, so that when it comes time to hop the lily pad (which that time always comes, whether its 4 years or 14 years) you&#039;ll be ready to leap.<br /><br />That&#039;s about it! The technical stuff, if you are intelligent, thoughtful, aggressive, and a &quot;go to&quot; guy, you&#039;ll do well. Big sacrifices up front, going the distance and more will reap BIG rewards. Trust me, I&#039;m living it. :)<br /><br />-A</div>
