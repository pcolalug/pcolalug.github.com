					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Downloading it as I am typing this.&nbsp; Going to also download the torrent file so I can seed that.&nbsp; Quick question.&nbsp; Will Slack 11 have a 64bit distro or is it all the same.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You can use the 32 bit distribution on a 64 bit computer, which is what I currently do with slack 10.2, but if you want a 64 bit version I think you are looking for Slamd64 (http://www.slamd64.com/). I&#039;ve never used it, so I can&#039;t comment on how good or stable it is. Anyways, I can&#039;t wait to get home and download and try the new slack! I&#039;ve been checking the site for a few weeks and looking over changelogs in anticipation. Yes, I know that is sort of sad.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">great to see Patrick Volkerding finally pushed 11-release out :)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="index.php%3Ftopic=3018.msg14828.html#msg14828">Quote from: Brent on October 03, 2006, 09:00:53 am</a></div><div class="quote">Having said that, the long delay of slack 11 forced me to try alternatives (xubuntu).&nbsp; I&#039;m glad I did, and I doubt I&#039;ll be going back,<br />but all the same it&#039;s good to know slack is still going strong.<br /></div><br />ummm it&#039;s always been going strong, as -current. Just because there hadn&#039;t been a -release recently doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t just sync right to current and have the latest and greatest. I&#039;ve done this for quite some time with no problems.&nbsp; :P <br /><br />unless you absolutely won&#039;t use anything but -stable tree off the -releases, I don&#039;t see why delay of slack 11 release would force you to try alternatives. -current has always been there and in my experience with it, is rock solid. pretty easy to roll a -current snapshot iso and burn it, or in the case of being within months of a new -release you will start finding servers that host nightly -current snapshot iso&#039;s&nbsp; ;)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I installed Slack 11 last night. It is my desktop/development machine. Install went very smoothly, basically the same install as 10.2. I am using the 2.6.17 kernel from extra. Installed the Nvidia drivers with no problem, so I can play with 3d stuff. It actually found my sound card, which 10.2 could never do without the Nvidia drivers which mysteriously disappeared recently from their site. Only sound issue I had was with Flash(need my Strong Bad fix you know), but that was solved by changing the KDE setting for audio idle to a much lower value. I even got my webcam working with Kopete. I haven&#039;t really played with much else yet, but so far I am very happy with it. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I installed Slackware 11.0 yesterday, and had some problems (which were not the fault of Slackware itself).&nbsp; I&#039;ve found that the -stable and -current versions of Freerock Gnome were made for Slack 10.2 and don&#039;t like 11.0.&nbsp; The present version of Gware Gnome appears to be the same way.&nbsp; So, I&#039;m back on 10.2 for a while, until the 3rd-party Gnome packagers catch up...<br /><br />Dan<br /></div>
