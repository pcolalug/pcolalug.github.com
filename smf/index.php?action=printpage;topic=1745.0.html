					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Has anyone here ever used openbsd?<br /><br />I've heard good things about it. &nbsp;However, I'd be using it as a 'desktop os'. &nbsp;Not sure that's it's strong suit. &nbsp;Then again, I didn't really like freebsd ...I might not like obsd.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have not used OpenBSD, but I have seen it in use. &nbsp;If you did not like FreeBSD for whatever reason, you might not like OpenBSD. &nbsp;OpenBSD just has the advantage of portability to many more architectures--alpha, PPC, SPARC, etc. &nbsp;It's not much different otherwise.<br /><br />Then again, it is free, and you can always experiment and toss it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">OpenBSD is excellent for boxen on the periphery of your network (routers, gateways, proxies, etc). Its touted as the most secure OS and they do go to great lengths to ensure things like buffer overflows are kept to a minimum. With the focus on security, as well as a Debian-like commitment to licensing, its not the most suitable for desktop use. Having said that, I do know someone who uses it as their desktop, but this dude doesn't spend a whole lot of time with GUI programs. Generally, I like to use OpenBSD for routers and infrastructure-type stuff, FreeBSD/Linux for servers and Linux for desktops. This gives me really nice Unix-like OS's everywhere and Linux has the best desktop experience of them all, IMHO. In the end, however, kilar is right on that if you didn't like FreeBSD, OpenBSD is probably too similar to warrent you giving it a shot on the desktop. Now, if you are building a router/firewall OTOH, I would suggest nothing else.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">yea with openbsd you start with basically nothing as far as packages and you have the ports tree, even though a lot of the desktop systems and such most people use in linux are in the ports tree, it's old versions and might take ya a bit of time to get it done....then when you want to update its gonna be an interesting trip down that road...... I personally wouldn't use any bsd system as my desktop simple because it isnt worth it when my slackware system does better for that job....but I do agree with rburt, now for a router/firewall/gateway/pf-bridge/etc that requires security and can be done fairly easily within openbsd, then it works great</div>
