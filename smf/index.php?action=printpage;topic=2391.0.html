					Title: <b>WRT54G Dropping Connection</b><br />
					Post by: <b>rugmonster</b> on <b>April 19, 2005, 10:50:42 am</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've got a Linksys WRT54G v3 (yes, we all know this don't we) and I'm running the HyperWRT firmware (http://www.hyperwrt.org) with WDS connecting to another WRT54G (earlier version) running the Sveasoft firmware. When I have a network intensive application, such as a torrent, running, the HyperWRT router tends to stop responding and I lose all connectivity with all the devices connected, both wired and wirelessly. Has anyone else had this issue and have any recommendations? I've heard that it should be away from other things that may interfere with it, such as monitors, power supplies, etc. but I don't see how that would make my router lock up.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Don't really have any good knowledge on this, but will state the obvious... &nbsp;I'd think it might be (in my best guess order of probability):<br /><br />1. &nbsp;Firmware bugs/instability<br />2. &nbsp;Heat-related<br />3. &nbsp;Interference from the other WRT54G<br /><br />All three should be fairly easy to prove/disprove.<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: danc</div><div class="quote">1. Firmware bugs/instability</div><br />I've tried two firmwares with this router, Sveasoft and now HyperWRT which is supposed to follow more closely with the official Linksys firmwares, so it supposedly supports the new v3.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: danc</div><div class="quote">2. Heat-related</div><br />The router does not feel hot at all and it is in a well ventilated spot. It's nothing like my older model (which does have the fan running in it quite nicely).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: danc</div><div class="quote">3. Interference from the other WRT54G</div><br />As for interference with the other WRT, that's on the other side of the room and they are configured to work together on the same channel.<br /><br />I'm beginning to think this is an issue with the v3 and the current firmware because I have yet to reset my older WRT due to unresponsivness since I moved.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Is this a wireless router....If so are you using 128 or 40 bit encryption?<br />Is the problem with a device attached wireless or is it a problem with a hardwired problem. I know that wireless will stop drpping packets like wild fire at 128 bit</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I'm using 128 bit on the wireless side, but this problem happens with all devices connected, to include those wired up. Even devices between the four port switch side of the router don't communicate. It locks up hard.</div>
