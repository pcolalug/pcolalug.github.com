					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome to the LUG Jac, we hope to see you at the next meeting.<br /><br />Like green_dragon37 said, just come as you are.&nbsp; There are no dues, initiations, or anything like that to be a part of the LUG, you need only attend meetings/post on forums.<br /><br />The next meeting will be this Thursday, June 18 at 6pm at Systems Specialists on 114 E. Wright Street, (as stated on the front page) and again, welcome!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome to the LUG Jac. Unfortunately I have to teach Thursday night from 5-10 or I would be there. But I look forward to meeting you at a meeting in the future.<br />BTW can you mention who you work for ? I do a lot of talks to the local community on Linux migration and love to hear about companies that are using *nix.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">bhoff,<br />Sorry, I wish I could help, but I am currently working in a windows only environment as a .net developer :-(&nbsp; The company I work for is AppRiver, and since it is a security company I cannot comment as to specifics.&nbsp; I have done consulting for Global Business Solutions / CSC for some of the UNIX systems over at Saufley Field, but as far as I know there are not many local companies using *nix.<br /></div>
