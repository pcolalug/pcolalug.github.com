					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello all,<br /><br />This is &quot;danc&quot;, posting under a new login, through a proxy.&nbsp; I&#039;m doing that because I can&#039;t log in under my original user name, because the current administration has *BANNED* me over a personal grudge and &quot;because they can&quot;.&nbsp; I am one of the original members of this LUG, and have served in all the elected officer positions in the past, including President.<br /><br />They have banned me because I was critical of the way the past administration (Steering Committee) was running the LUG.&nbsp; The main person involved with this is &quot;green_dragon37&quot;, who was the president then, and is now the secretary.&nbsp; The new president, &quot;Yossarian&quot; thinks that this is a wise decision, and goes along with whatever &quot;green_dragon37&quot; says, apparently.<br /><br />It&#039;s all quite petty, and is intended to keep me from voicing my opinions or contributing to the LUG.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if they are afraid of looking bad, or are just doing it because they feel &quot;powerful&quot; in their &quot;elected&quot; positions.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t seem like the right approach to running a LUG, or in keeping with the basic principles of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), does it?<br /><br />I have emailed them numerous times asking for an explanation for the above situation, and they simply ignore the emails.&nbsp; I am pointing this out so that the rest of you will know what kind of leadership you have running this LUG these days.&nbsp; I am hoping that they will reconsider the ban, and allow me to again contribute to the knowledge and operation of this LUG.&nbsp; I have a lot to offer in this regard, and it sure seems like this is the time that the LUG needs all the assistance it can get...<br /><br />I&#039;m sure this post and this user account will be promptly deleted once they see it, but hopefully some of you &quot;regular&quot; members will see it first.&nbsp; Perhaps some of you can remember the contributions I have made in the past, and assist me in &quot;clearing my name&quot; with this current administration.&nbsp; I would appreciate that.&nbsp; For what it&#039;s worth, any mistakes or transgressions I may have made in the past were the result of the way the LUG was being operated, and were intended as efforts by me to try and get it back on track.&nbsp; Those things are in the past now, and will not re-occur.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Dan<br />(danc)<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Er, we explained it two months ago to you.&nbsp; Posting ASCII GOATSE IS NOT TOLERATED ON OUR FORUMS.&nbsp; It was seen by me, past president David Peach (A Minister!) and who knows how many other members.&nbsp; This is a family site for crying out loud!&nbsp; Please refrain from creating accounts in the future, as the administration will be banning them as well.<br /><br />Ian</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">As much as I hate to turn members away from the LUG, your past behavior in breaking the by-laws of the Pensacola Linux User Group do call for your being banned.<br /><br />Our By-Laws are based on those of LEAP, and those claim that a member CAN be banned.&nbsp; They can also be UNBANNED by a 2/3 majority vote of either the executives or the general membership.<br /><br />To make it fair, we shall hold a vote.&nbsp; If more than 50%, of the membership feels that you deserve another chance, then I will personally allow it.&nbsp; Otherwise, the ban will remain in place.<br /><br />However, if you break the rules again you <b><i>will</i></b> be banned.<br /><br /><br />Also, I haven&#039;t been ignoring you, I just never received the e-mails.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I feel Dan has had all the warnings he should have gotten and more. He was banned for inappropriate material he posted because he got mad. He is a well qualified linux guru but that should not excuse how he acted. His trying to shame the steering committee to do as he though was best was a sham. If he REALLY wanted to help the lug he could have taken a active part but instead he belittled members of the steering committee which was counter productive. In my opinion his character shows me he will do and act as he pleased if he feels it is warranted to him and not abide by the rules. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Dan,<br /><br />When I first started going to LUG meetings I just wanted to see what it was about. I was starting to get into linux and was interested in meeting with people who had simliar interests. The meetings I went to were ok I guess. It wasn&#039;t until I saw you at one of the meetings, and hearing you talk did I realize that no, they were not ok. <br /><br />I heard you talk about how the meetings used to be in the so called &quot;golden years.&quot; You are right, organization was non existant, there was no structure to the meetings, nothing fun was occuring, when you spoke everything you said was on the money. Not only did you know what you were talking about when it came to the structure of an &quot;organization&quot; like the LUG, you also seemed to know linux best. You would post articles and information on the Forums that was interesting and informative, I particularly liked the one about slackware actually teaches an individual how to use linux, rather than just learning a user friendly distro like ubuntu or opensuse. Then there was the horrible attempt at &quot;organizing&quot; a LAN party. After NOTTHING occured, you mentioned you knew why nothing did, but did not say why. I also know why, because nobody took the reigns and said, this is what is happening. Instead you had people including the VP say, hey what is happening with this? Nobody made the call, it was just a horribly display in the leadership being lazy and waiting for someone else to do it, they didn&#039;t even see if the room it would be conducted in was free, just a pic saying it was being used and a sad face. No one seemed to care about the meetings, show up, organize or plan, it was just failure after to failure everytime I went.<br /><br />It was at this time I realized Dan, you were right about everything with the LUG, nobody cared, and thats when I decided, I didn&#039;t care anymore. If the leadership of the organization I just started in couldn&#039;t get up and do something, I didn&#039;t want to be apart of it. Thats when I stopped going to meetings, barely posted on the forums, because what was the point. And if they are going to ban you, the ONE guy I saw as someone who truly cared about what the LUG was and could be, then this is not the organization for me. Say what you want about me, but I came in as an outsider and saw things for what they were, I was hoping things would change and get better, then maybe I would start going to meetings again, but I don&#039;t care. Dan was the one guy I saw that knew how to make things better, and you ban him, ban me, I don&#039;t care.<br /><br />thedood<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am the founder of the Lug Brett Hoff, And I would just like to state that Dan had no problem banning me from the original IRC pcolalug channel.<br />And never would allow me back in and there was no by-laws being abused for that. Now he abuses not only this time, But many other times in the past.<br />I feel he should never be allowed to post again to this forum. This is up to the steering committee of course just my 2 cents</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">There are no bans on the #pcolalug channel, and haven&#039;t been for a *LONG* time.&nbsp; You know that, just as well as I do.<br /><br />When was the last time you were on IRC, in the #pensacola_linux channel, supporting the LUG?<br /><br /></div>
