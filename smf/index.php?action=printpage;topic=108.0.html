					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">1. Moved this to the Mandrake forum. That's probably a better place for it.<br /><br />2. Try going into the Mandrake IRC. It's at irc.openprojects.net port 6667 and the channel is: #mandrake<br /><br /><br />Steve</div>

I was running a Sound Blaster Live Value on my previous system and 8.2 worked fine with it. Have you gone into the menu then configuration/Hardware/HardDrake? It should have detected your sound card and even give you the option of configuring it if you want. <br /><br />You shouldn't need to &quot;install&quot; any drivers for the SoundBlaster Live Value.<br /><br />Steve</div>
