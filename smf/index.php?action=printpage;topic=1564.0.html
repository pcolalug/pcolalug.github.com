					Title: <b>Military Use of Linux</b><br />
					Post by: <b>rugmonster</b> on <b>April 21, 2004, 08:58:24 am</b>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This (http://technology.newsforge.com/technology/04/04/20/2229245.shtml) article at Newsforge (http://newsforge.com) brought a question to mind. Basically, the president of the Los Angeles LUG resigned his position because of his objections to linux's use by the US military and other agencies in Iraq.<br /><br />My view on this is that when you make a technology, there are going to be other uses than what you initially intended. The military uses products that the commercial world uses because they work. Anything that can get the job done, the military will use and since they can get it cheaper with the freedom to customize it, makes it attractive; the same as it does for the commercial world.<br /><br />Actions like this make no sense to me. Uses of something for good or ill are what you get when you release something into the wild. I'll close with one question. Why did he stop now when China has been producing and using Linux for several years and they have one of the worst human rights records in the world?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I suppose that guy's resignation was meant to be some sort of lofty political statement. &nbsp;I think he failed in his intentions.<br /><br />Chuck</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Pointless.<br /><br />And if you read the interview, do you think there was something else under the hood motivating the guy to leave the LUG's leadership.<br /><br />Just pointless.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Even more rediculous considering that the foundation of the &quot;freedom&quot; Linux provides is the GPL, which explicitly states that you cannot restrict the rights granted therein based on what someone will use the software for. The whole point of FOSS is that anyone can use the software for any purpose. Period. Its no less of a Good Thing(TM) if someone uses FOSS for e-vil.</div>
