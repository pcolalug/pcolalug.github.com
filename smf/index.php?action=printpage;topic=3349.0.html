					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well guys&#039; I was just given a laptop and video card for job I am doing. The laptop is in prime condition and is same model as my other Toshiba. I have just ordered 2 gigs of pc2700 ram for it from Crucial and a 16gb Solid state disk drive from Newegg for it.<br />With the Celeron M 1.3 ghz processor I am hoping that this will give me some noticeable performance increase. Will post how it goes should have the equipment here by Tuesday! I am planning on running CentOS 5.1 on it for testing and getting My RHCE, and a 5 gig Partition for BackTrac 3 for Pentesting. It has an Atheros card built in and I have another card for the pcmcia slot that is high power for refining the test.<br /><br />Well I got the SSD in and it was flawless upgrade recognized it right away and formated and installed BT3 with the gui installer from the live CD. And BT3 is awesome they have done a lot of work on this to make it a world class project and all fro free!!<br />The Kingston 2 gig memory also was the max. allowed for the Toshiba m35x-s149 laptop and also worked fine.<br />I have seen a considerable increase in performance and the SSD is out performing the 5400rpm HD at every turn.<br />Not to mention the reduced power consumption and the shock resistance and no moving parts makes for a great drive.<br />I only acquired the 16gb but 32gb was available at time of purchase. Have had power out issues with the battery running down and hard shutdowns with no adverse affect on the harddrive. Note..it does have it&#039;s own error checksum and correction.<br />Only problem now is I have noticed the processor fan is not coming on at boot up not a good thing. So I will have to do some exploratory surgery tonight.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well it has been working great....I still have the fan issue but I am thinking of running jumper to the usb power for it and let it run all the time not sure yet! The SSD is great and even on hard power downs it has it&#039;s own error checking and correction. Also noticed considerable speed increase from the 5400 rpm hd, Along with the 2 gig s of ram it has once again made this notebook worthy of hard us again!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Out of curiosity can you force the fan on in the /proc/acpi/fan to 1?&nbsp; I cant remember the exact location of it as I do not have my laptop to look right now.&nbsp; I know I could always turn my fan on manually if I needed too.<br /><br />Lee</div>
