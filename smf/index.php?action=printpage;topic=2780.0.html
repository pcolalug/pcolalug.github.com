					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am wanting to install Linux on my laptop (Dell Inspiron 8600) and I am leaning towards Fedora Core 4 only because I am slightly familiar with it, but I have heard good things about Ubuntu working great with most laptops.... does anybody have any advice as to which distro I should choose? Keep in mind I know next to nothing about Linux... </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">oh... something else I was wondering... I go to UWF and in the bookstore they have a &quot;pocketguide to Linux&quot; and it was based on Fedora Core... do they make those for other distros? Is there a Ubuntu For Idiots book or something like that?? That would be tremendously great...<br /><br />I probably wont even attempt to install for several days while I gather information...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Chances are, as new as Ubuntu is, you won&#039;t find a book on it yet.<br /><br />I looked up your laptop and it seems that most any recent release of a distribution should work.&nbsp; I&#039;m not entirely sure about the integrated wireless, but there is NDISWrapper if there is no native driver available.<br /><br />Now here comes my opinion, so take it as that. I&#039;ve tried Ubuntu and while they have some great ideas, there is a lot of polishing that remains to be seen on most of their &quot;easy to use configuration apps&quot;. They&#039;re configuration wizards often crash and you wind up go into configuration files instead. There is however, a great support community with lots of Ubuntu fans frothing at the mouth to help you. Fedora on the other hand I have not had as much experience with. I&#039;m sure some of this is true, but I personally have always felt like it was a more sluggish system. Redhat and later Fedora Core releases just never did it for me, so I never gave it much time.<br /><br />As for newbie friendly systems, I like Mandriva and SUSE. Especially SUSE. I currently run Debian (which Ubuntu is based off of), but I&#039;m the type that tends to avoid pretty wizards in favor of digging in the config files for the most part. My overall suggestion, try a few distributions out. Find the one that fits you. I&#039;ve gone from using Caldera OpenLinux to Slackware to Debian to Gentoo to Mandriva when it was Mandrake to LFS to SUSE to Ubuntu and finally back to Debian. That&#039;s been since &#039;99 and I&#039;ll still try different distros out as they pique my interest.<br /><br />Oh yeah, books on linux are waaaaay overrated. Everything you need for general use is available online. Google is the best book alternative you have. Save your money and definitely don&#039;t spend more than you have to at the UWF bookstore. They price gouge there!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I&#039;ve got Ubuntu on my laptop (I&#039;m on it now)!! When I first got it installed it prompted me to update a bunch of stuff... so I let it. I figure updates are good. The thing I need to figure out how to do now is install stuff.... Firefox 1.0.7 is included and it didn&#039;t update during the thing... so I downloaded Firefox 1.5, but I have no idea how to install it. Sure I could just uncompress it to a directory, but then I will have two copies of firefox on my computer and that just wont do... Same thing goes with openofffice... the offical 2.0 release is not included... its one of the betas, so updating it would probably be good too... Here are the things I&#039;m going to (probably) need to do that I don&#039;t have a clue about<br /><br />1) Install software (ie firefox, OpenOffice, etc.)<br />2) Install development software (I just need something for C++ and Eclipse)<br />3) The GUI seems kinda sluggish... would NVidia drivers help? If so, I don&#039;t know how to install them<br />4) The scroll funtion of the side of my synaptics touchpad isn&#039;t working<br />5) I need wireless networking (it didn&#039;t detect during install)<br /><br />Thank y&#039;all for all y&#039;alls help... I have always felt daunted by Linux, but I didn&#039;t know there was such a support group for it...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I was trying to give you a subtle nudge to go search Google. Ubuntu has documentation out there, and good documentation at that. There is another site out there called ubuntuguide.org (http://ubuntuguide.org) that will tell you exactly how to do particular tasks, sadly with no explanation of why you&#039;re doing it.<br /><br />For Firefox, I did a search on Google using the terms &quot;ubuntu firefox 1.5&quot; (http://www.google.com/search?q=ubuntu+firefox+1.5). Bam, first page was from the Ubuntu wiki on how to install it and an explanation as to why it won&#039;t be going into the backports. If you want to find out about the backports, I bet a search of &quot;ubuntu backports&quot; would find you something.<br /><br />If you want to install the Nvidia drivers, GO DOWNLOAD THEM AND READ THE INSTALL GUIDE!<br /><br />Wireless networking...Did you even click on the links provided?!?!<br /><br />I want to help you, but you have to help yourself first. I won&#039;t speak for the rest of the group, but I will speak for this forum. This forum is not a Google proxy. Don&#039;t abuse it as such. You will not learn <b>a thing</b> if you ask for the answer without looking yourself. There is a lot to be learned in simply looking for the answer. I got curious about things I had no idea existed in quests to fix problems. I would read about something that sounded foreign, do a quick search and go &quot;Oh wow, that&#039;s cool! I&#039;ll come back to that later and check it out&quot;.<br /><br />Head over to http://www.google.com and do some searching. I promise, you will quickly find an answer to most of your questions, probably find some new questions, but stop back by Google and search some more. If you have a specific problem installing a driver, such as it doesn&#039;t work right or something gets messed up and you don&#039;t know how to make it go back (keep a log of what you&#039;ve done...on paper), come back to us.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sorry if I seemed like I was asking for someone to explain to me how to do all those things... it was late at night and I was merely letting everyone know that I had managed to get it installed... I figured I would the things I needed to fix as well and if anyone had a suggestion I would follow it and if not, sometime today I would start trying to figure it out...<br /><br />and yes I looked at the links, and I&#039;m trying to figure stuff out... but when some of the stuff I find talks about recompiling the kernel that kinda freaks me out... lol.</div>
