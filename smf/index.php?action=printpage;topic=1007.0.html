					Title: <b>Dropline Gnome Update: Sept 16 2003</b><br />
					Post by: <b>imnes</b> on <b>September 16, 2003, 09:24:21 pm</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Gnome 2.4 (http://www.gnome.org/start/2.4/) is out, and that means a new installment of the ever popular Dropline Gnome (http://www.dropline.net/gnome). &nbsp;<br /><br />One thing I've noticed immediately, the rounded corners of the 'menu panel' are gone. &nbsp;That's because gnome no longer differentiates between all the different panels, there's just one generic type that can be made to handle anything, and put anywhere. &nbsp;So that's ok, speculation is a theme / applet will be released soon to give people their rounded corners back, but I don't miss it.<br /><br />The interface has been further refined and cleaned up. &nbsp;New icons (look like they're going with Ximian's icon set instead of RedHat's). &nbsp;Mozilla, Firebird, and the rest of the browsers have been replaced with the very fast and nice looking Epiphany browser.<br /><br />Gnome now has improved &quot;Accessiblity&quot; support, including an on-screen keyboard, a magnifier, and a screen reader. &nbsp;That's very cool.<br /><br />Otherwise, all the standard applications we're used to having in Dropline are still there. &nbsp;Some of them have cleaned up icons, and everything feels more unified.<br /><br />One thing you'll notice (or I notcied) is that gnome, overall, seems much quicker in this release. &nbsp;Nautilus has seen some visual improvements, the interface has changed a bit, and it loads and works quicker.<br /><br />The Screen Preferences app is back, so you can change your resolution in X (really change it, not just CTRL+ and CTRL-) without having to exit and reconfigure and restart.<br /><br />I'll post more as I play around with it. &nbsp;If you're into slackware, give it a shot. &nbsp;<br /><br />Nick<br /><br />(http://www.homeweb.org/~imnes/linux/slackware/screens/dropline-2.4/dl-2.4-screen-001s.png)<br />Click for full size<br />&nbsp;(http://www.homeweb.org/~imnes/linux/slackware/screens/dropline-2.4/dl-2.4-screen-001.png)</div>
