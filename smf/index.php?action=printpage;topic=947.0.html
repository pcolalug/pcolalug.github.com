					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am by no means an expert in the video card field (is there anything I am an expert at?) But here is a thought. Are you sure it is the monitor? I assume that this setup worked before with another monitor? It seems like it is more of a video card issue.<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: phr0gman</div><div class="quote"><br />When I type xinit I get<br />(**)SVGA 24bpp not supported for this chipset<br /><br />*** A configured device found, but display modes could not be resolved.*** </div><br />The first part of that makes me suspect video card. The second half makes me suspect monitor. If you have not already done so, try plugging in a different monitor and set up the system with that monitor and see how it goes.<br /><br />Again, I am assuming you have already done this, but it never hurts to point it out.<br /><br />Oh, I am an expert at eating pizza. :lol:</div>

I was hung up on the monitor not working and forgot about my new video card eGeforce 4 ti 4200 8x &nbsp;which is also not supported. <br /><br />That is what happens when you buy before research.<br /><br />Your post made me realize that it is not just a monitor problem.<br /><br />I am new to Linux what is the course of action when your hardware is not supported?<br /><br /><br />CPU is Barton 2400 not Baton &nbsp;:oops: <br /><br />Stu</div>

They have drivers for Linux and they work quite well.<br /><br />Make sure to follow their directions, though. Read the doumentation first.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have not read NVidia's site, but I would suspect that you need to start your line with:<br />./ <br /><br />Therefore, your command to start the shell script would be (from the directory that the script is in):<br /><br />./ sh NIVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-4496-pkg2.run <br /><br />That forces it to run the script by that name from the current directory. Very nice trick to know as you may have to do this from time to time. I always run scripts with the ./ and that seems to take care of it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Not sure if I get what it is you're trying to do here..<br /><br />But one way to execute the nvidia installer script, is to do the following:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">chmod u+x NIVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-4496-pkg2.run</div><br /><br />The above step sets the executable bit on the file. Afterwards, do a:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">./NIVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-4496-pkg2.run</div><br /><br />with no spaces in between the dot and the slash and the filename.</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I recently patched my Mandrake 9.1 kernel for Win4Lin. I downloaded the latest nvidia installer to my /tmp directory according to the installation instructions and after rebooting to run level 3, that is without starting X windows I logged in as root and cd /tmp. Then I ran this command:<br />&quot;sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-4363.run&quot;<br />which is the name of the version of the installer I downloaded. I then followed the on screen instructions and it worked fine for me.<br /><br />Here is an excerpt from the readme.txt installation file.<br />&quot;After you have downloaded NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-4363.run,<br />begin installation by exiting X, cd'ing into the directory containing<br />the downloaded file, and run:<br /><br />sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-4363.run &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The .run file is a self-extracting archive. &nbsp;When the .run file is<br />executed, it extracts the contents of the archive, and runs the contained<br />`nvidia-installer` utility, which will walk you through installation of<br />the NVIDIA driver.&quot;<br /><br />Hope this helps</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If the &quot;sh NVIDIA.....&quot; doesn't work then try &quot;sh ./NVIDIA....&quot;<br /><br /><br />The &quot;./&quot; tells sh to look in the current directory for the file to act on. <br /><br />One thing to remember with Linux. It is very path strict. Unlike DOS it won't run/reference a file in your current directory unless the directory is in the path environment variable or you reference the file using &quot;./&quot; which refers to the current dirctory.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just spent an hour or so on the phone with Stu, and we couldn't get his video working...<br /><br />Loaded the Nvidia driver, and it completed normally. &nbsp;Edited XF86Config-4 to change driver to &quot;nvidia&quot;. &nbsp;Verified /etc/inittab was defaulted for runlevel 5. &nbsp;On reboot, still comes up to CLI only. &nbsp;Using &quot;startx&quot; results in errors from X saying &quot;no screens found&quot;. &nbsp;Went through XF86Config-4 again carefully and found no problems. &nbsp;He was using a USB mouse which I thought might cause problems, so we changed him over to a PS2 style mouse, and edited XF86Config-4 appropriately. &nbsp;Still getting the &quot;no screens&quot; error...<br /><br />Tried &quot;lsmod&quot; and noticed that the nvidia module wasn't loading. &nbsp;Did a &quot;insmod nvidia&quot; and it appeared to load normally. &nbsp;Still the same results when trying to start X however. &nbsp;There is an &quot;alias /dev/nvidia* nvidia&quot; line in his /etc/modules.conf.<br /><br />I'm stumped and don't know what else to suggest to Stu. &nbsp;Told him that we could most probably get him going at the LAN Party on Saturday, and he'll bring that machine. &nbsp;So we'll have something to do there...<br /><br />Dan</div>
