					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">have freebsd installed on my laptop. pcmcia wireless card is recognized. setup card for dhcp. it gets its ip info from my wireless router. checked with ifconfig and wicontrol. but i connect connect from there. gives error saying my &quot;host name&quot; is not listed. mentions adding entry to /etc/hosts. not sure what to add when using dhcp... suggestions?<br /><br />also. when i try to shutdown it hangs (i'm assuming the wireless card is not getting properly turned off).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">add the name you called your system in /etc/hosts<br /><br />Example, all my computers are named after Ender's Game characters. My main system is always Ender and the secondary is always Bean, and laptop is Dink. Well, I have an entry in my hosts files that looks like this:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"><br />ender &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 192.168.1.2<br />bean &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;192.168.1.3<br />dink &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;192.168.1.4<br />valentine &nbsp; 192.168.1.5<br />peter &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 192.168.1.6<br /></div><br /><br />A hosts file is like a simple DNS. In fact, DNS takes the place of hosts files, but on a small network, it is all that is necessary. Like DNS, it's a mapping of easy to remember computer names and their IP addresses.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">and that works if the card gets its address through dhcp?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You can also set it the host to 127.0.0.1. It sounds like it is trying to identify itself, so that should work. You can also setup static IPs with your router rather than doing DHCP. In a home network, you don't really have to worry about management of resources like you do in a large scale network.</div>
