					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Neat. &nbsp;I'm assuming that Linus did the same thing with 2.6 as he did with 2.4, and pushed this release a bit early in order to hammer out the bugs more quickly.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">ok 1 quirk that I'm trying to figure out....when i go to mount my cdrom using mount /mnt/cdrom<br /><br />it gives me this error<br /><br />mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/cdrom,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;or too many mounted file systems<br /><br /><br />my floppy mounts, i just triple checked that in the 2.6.0 kernel config that I enabled iso9660 filesystem support, etc..... my fstab file worked for 2.4.22 and mounted right....also, some stupid reason slackware wants me to be superuser to even be able to use the mount command lol<br /><br />anyone have any ideas? I've done changed my fstab so much trying to fix the mount being su only but still no luck<br /><br />also, have no clue why its giving me that error when I try and mount cds now in 2.6.0</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Does /dev/cdrom symlink point to the right device?<br /><br />There's a few different ways in slackware to be able to mount / unmount devices as root. &nbsp;One is to add the &quot;user&quot; option in /etc/fstab but not sure what the official recommended fix is.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">dunno how long it would take me to pull off...if i would be done by tomorrow for the meeting/lan LOL but considering currently i'm triple booting using grub....have redhat9 - 2.4.20-x, slackware 9.1 - 2.6.0, and then winblows 2000 pro......i dont use redhat9 anymore since a month or 2 ago when i got slack going great(till lately LOL)....running 2 80gb harddrives....the windoze partitions are fat32 and seperated between my storage and actual winnt....thinking about reformatting(also reformat and get rid of rh9) and reinstalling w2k pro onto one harddrive or part of one harddrive...then give slackware everything else and dual boot w2k and slack with lilo<br /><br />i RARELY boot into w2k, but I use it for certain things like maybe once every month or 2 if i need to at all.....but since i swapped motherboards, w2k is so hosed up i just want to whipe it and clean install...and also want to dump rh9<br /><br />i know on installing slackware it gives u options on what kernel u want to put in....currently i have my 2.6kernel compiled and ready to go except for a few quirks.....anyone familiar with slack if it would allow me to put in my 2.6.0 kernel on slack install....then can just run swaret and install dropline and install the rest of my stuff straight out(gonna preserve my /home so i dont have to redo my desktop hehe)<br />the reason for redoing slack is my dropline install has an issue here and there.....and also in the past when i recompiled my 2.4.22 kernel and installed dropline it seemed like thats when my mount command went su only....because another system that i installed slack and dropline on seems to work fine for mount as any user with defaults on the fstab<br /><br />sorry for long post, but sorta a last minute scramble LOL</div>
