					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Howdy all..<br />&nbsp; My power supply made a big stinky this afternoon. This is the fourth one I have had go bad. I stold one from my son&#039;s computer since it doesn&#039;t work, &quot;no Xtra Problems cd&quot; to fix it.&nbsp; What is a good brand that is not too exspensive, probably in the 500 watt range for&nbsp; dual 2800&#039;s? I think there are like 10,000 brands or one power supply with 10,000 different names!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I second that recommendation.<br /><br />My suggestion is that you should never spend less than $60 on a power supply. A good price for good quality seems to be in the $80 to $120 price point.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The orginal server case I bought came with a 350 watt mystery brand. It lasted a few months and died. It was when I first started messing around with Linux, so I wasn&#039;t sure what was going on. The system was unstable and randomly crashed. So I ordered a 450 watt mystery brand for $20 what a deal! Well two days later things became unstable again. So I figured I&#039;d stuck files where they didn&#039;t belong and it was not the power supply.&nbsp; After a week or so I decided to change it again and bought a $80 mystery brand. I was in Japan at the time so I thought with the ac power being 100v maybe that was an issue. Well It worked for a year or more and then started doing flaky things again. So I ordered one here this last spring a 475 watt unknown brand again for like $40 and got the stinky smell yesterday.&nbsp; I thought I&#039;d write this story incase someone upgrades and has stability issues to keep the power supply in mind. I&#039;ll have to vist new egg soon and I&#039;ll probably go with the Antec! Thanks guys!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well the Antec lasted 5 weeks. I did add another surge protector. I bought some other brand 580 watts. It has cannon style plugs on it , really nice.&nbsp; Its been about three weeks and it still works! We&#039;ll see.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">what kind of Antec was it? <br /><br />I recently had my 4year old truepower 430 (3year warranty even) finally droop a bit on the 5v rail and cause my system to start shutting off on me. it took a few weeks plus the thanksgiving holidays but antec made good and I got a replacement truepower 2.0 430 to replace the old truepower 430, and because they messed up the shipping a bit and they thought the truepower 2.0 430 got lost in shipping, I got a truepower 2.0 EPS12V 550 too :)<br /><br />so far that was my only antec to croak and it was still rock solid on 12v and 3.3v, just 5v was drooping below 4.7-4.8v and would continue to droop as it got hotter under load until system would shutdown. not bad for a 4year old psu that has ran pretty much nonstop it&#039;s entire life, although my others including my antec smartpower AT psu that is in a pentium-mmx 233 are still kicking well past 4 years lol<br /><br />going to rma the psu to antec? it&#039;s a bit of a hassle initially and takes them a few days to ship it out, plus ground shipping back to you, but they seem to do pretty well. although I wasn&#039;t very happy with them for a couple of weeks until they made good and sent me the 550 eps12V along with the 430</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think it was a True Blue 480 watt. I think even if its replaced / rma it will die soon. Since I went to this new 580 watt both CPU&#039;s will come up, well for the last two weeks. I have noticed the last couple of start ups only one CPU will come up. I have to shutdown &amp; unplug the power and then turn it back on. So I&#039;m going to guess this power supply maybe short lived too. After that I may consider a new computer. changing power supplies every couple of months is getting costly. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">i haven&#039;t read the whole thread, so forgive me if this was asked, but you DO have a UPS between your pc and wall, right?&nbsp; It could be very unstable power that was frying your power supplies as well.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve been sooooo busy with work, so I have not visited the board in awhile. I don&#039;t have an UPS.&nbsp; I have a GA-7DPXDW Mother board, 80 gig IDE drive, dvd/cdrom, GeForce 4, 8x, Sound Blaster card, USB 2. controller card, 512 meg mem x2, MP2800 x2. Older stuff now, the only power hog is the dual 2800&#039;s. The power supplies usually go slow, start having issues for a couple days then die, sometimes stink. So it acts like they are dieing a slow death.&nbsp; I would like to upgrade maybe this year. I have my eye on the new Quad cores. I&#039;m thinking like a dual Quad core. They are still using drug dealer pricing for now, so I&#039;ll wait.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It sounds like you have bad power. At the very least, get an UPS that does line conditioning. It may be worth while to have an electrician come check out your lines though. I would hate to see your house burn down.<br /><br />Bhoff, you want to chime in on this?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Actually just listened to a nice seminar from APC just on this matter.<br />sounds like it is not power surges.....which usaually start at the 141v ac range up.<br />Thinking you are more likely running into what they call brownout&#039;s.<br />These are created from many things...poor power grid feeeding your area transformer, <br />tree limbs hitting line drawing the current down and power needs in the local area not being met.<br />An APC battery back-up unit would keep this from happening.<br />I would check with Gulf Power they can hook up a monitor to see the highs and lows and create<br />a chart of them.<br /><br />Hope this helps...............<br />Don&#039;t think your house is going to burn down thou :)<br /><br />Brett Hoff<br />Master Electrician<br />A.S Electrical eng.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It was doing this when we lived in Japan. We had 100v there I lost one power supply soon after I built it. It was a 350 watt that came with a server case! I bought a P/S from a Japanese Computer store, it lasted the longest a little over a year, however I had two MP 1200&#039;s back then. Now I have gone through three of four in the last 1 1/2 years. Well I mainly wanted to find out was, what kind and capacity should I be using?<br />I have read where some people are using dual power supplies. I&#039;m not sure how thats done I don&#039;t have space for it anyway. Well thats all. thanks... guys!<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You have to have a motherboard that supports dual power supplies and typically, you won&#039;t get that outside of enterprise class workstations and servers. Dual power supplies are only worth it when your system needs high reliability. A home system rarely qualifies as that.<br /><br />If you have been having this problem with quality power supplies in multiple locations, I would venture to say your motherboard may be the root of the problem. I still think a line conditioner would do you a lot of good to deal with power spikes and brown outs. Both can be detrimental to any and all of your hardware.</div>
