					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Oh, talk about holy-war material!<br /><br /><br />But seriously, I prefer Slackware as my 'stable' distro, even though I have this habit of hopping around every now and a while and testing out other distros. &nbsp;I frankly don't appreciate candy-coated installers, 'smart' utilities, cute little window managers/desktops, and other misfeatures that usually go along with attempts at making Linux more Windows-esque.<br /><br />Not that I'm against user-friendly things, but when that user-friendly stuff either only partially works, or starts to get in my way.. it's totally self-defeating.<br /><br />I'll stop here for now, before I start frothing at the mouth about why I like Slackware. &nbsp;:lol:</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I voted for Slackware but just cause that's what I'm running this month :) &nbsp;Seriously it has the best gnome2 distro available IMHO so that's why I'm running it. &nbsp;Package management in it is pretty weak though. &nbsp;My all time favorite so far would be FreeBSD, with RedHat being a close second, although I'm not running either of those at the moment.<br /><br />I think I'll be getting a new laptop later this month so I'll let you know what goes on there, it will either be FreeBSD or Slackware.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I used to use Slackware and it is definitely one of the best distros. I do however think that Gentoo is becoming a better distro at this point. <br /><br />*of course for my desktop nothing beats mac OS X* <br /><br />;)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have said before my history with distros. I have used everything from Slackware to Gentoo with Debian, Redhat, Mandrake, SuSE and Caldera in between. I voted for Gentoo because I think they have one of the absolute best package management systems. I think the package management is one of the only things that really sets a distro apart from the others. Yes, the packages are important along with the added tools, but this all comes down to the way the packages are put together. Gentoo takes the best ideas of debian, but brings in the best aspects of ports and keeps up with the bleed edge of the available software. I think it is by far the superior way to handle package management.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I agree totally. That is a big part of why I joined up with the development team</div>
