					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would sugguest to anyone that they avoid having anything to do with SCO-group. They are in the midst of sueing IBM over alleged licence violations, the worst of which implicates OSS and Linux in general.<br /><br />The filing goes so far as to state that Linux would not be where it is today without IBM &quot;leaking&quot; SCO intellectual property... &nbsp;:evil: <br /><br />At the risk of sounding the fanboy, Bruce Perens, ESR, RMS, and the other &quot;pillars&quot; of the community are advocating boycotts of SCO.<br /><br />Now, if you could dig through said distro and find where SCO has included some of their UNIX ip, well, that would make it GPL, and problem solved...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay I won't be playing with sco. &nbsp;I'll stick with more friendly distros :)<br /><br />Anybody read through their site? &nbsp;They proudly tell you how they're suing IBM and seeking damages no less than $1,000,000,000.00 (one billion dollars). &nbsp;Dr. Evil popped into my head when I read that. &nbsp;(From Austin Powers? &nbsp;Who did I lose with that one...)<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Before I read the Dr. Evil comment, I was thinking it. That's too funny. Yes, Mr. Love is quite the...um...business man. Like I said, beware the beast that was Caldera. Since they are one of the leaders of the UnitedLinux movement, I hesitate to put my support behind the group.</div>
