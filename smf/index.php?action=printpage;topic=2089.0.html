					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">http://www.scummvm.org/<br /><br />It's an emulator for the scripting environment, Scumm. &nbsp;Basically it allows you to play some of the greatest adventure titles of all time including my favorites, The Dig, Full Throttle, Sam and Max Hit the Road, Day of the Tentacle, and others.<br /><br />Anyway, it turns out they've got verisons for lots of things (even Dreamcast!) and just so happen to have a Slackware package. &nbsp;It runs smooth as silk, just like the Windows version, and I'm using it to play The Dig right now (manager just happened to have a copy, bonus).<br /><br />If you've never heard of these games then do yourself a favor: &nbsp;go to eBay, grab both of the aforementioned, and load 'em up in ScummVM.<br /><br />I'm not an expert at seeing how things in a Slack package are put in the system but so far it seems like only one file, the ScummVM executable itself, has been used and that's put in /usr/bin. &nbsp;Anyone know offhand how I can see what other files were in the package, where they were put, or what files this executable needs to run? &nbsp;Thanks.<br /><br />Oh, if you're on Slack the older version, 6.0, works just fine. &nbsp;No reason to build a new one.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Slack's packages are nothing more than a tar.gz. There is a directory structure in there, so you could, in theory, just do a tar -xzvf &lt;package name&gt; into some directory and look at everything in there. That should work.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hmm, cool, thanks. &nbsp;I had begun to wonder but never experimented. &nbsp;Thanks for the tip.<br /><br /><br /><br />Finished the Dig this morning. &nbsp;Yes yes, that's less than ten hours to rip through the game, but then I've played it before to completion and that means that only once in awhile I was stuck on a puzzle. &nbsp;Still a great story.</div>
