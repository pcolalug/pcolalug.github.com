					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello all,<br />I've been lurking around this board for about a month now, but I'd figure I'd finally post something and introduce myself.<br /><br />I've been working with Linux for about 4 years now, my first experience with it having been by installing Slackware via disksets(shudder) onto an old 486 of mine. &nbsp;Since then I've gone through several different distro's and several upgrades in machines, and for now I've currently settled on Slackware 8. &nbsp;I'm also working on a pet project of mine, building a Linux system entirely from scratch, with the dual results of producing a custom-tailored Linux, as well as the learning experience gained from the process.<br /><br />I was quite pleased to find that there is a Linux user group around here in the Pensacola area, and since I have some spare time I'll probably be able to drop by the next meeting.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Next meeting is tonight. <br /><br />I started in Linux about 4 years ago as well. But when I got involved I was able to find a few distros in a boxed CD set. I think I paid a whopping $10 for the set. I don't think I ever installed any of them. I just read through alot of the support material and decided to buy a Linux for Idiots book that had Caldera 2. something on it. <br /><br />In my short lived time, I think that Slackware and SuSE are the only two of the main distros that I have not tried. I have been convinced at different times that different distros were going to be the one to turn the tide and everyone would flock to Linux because of them. Caldera was my first choice. Then it was Corel. Then Mandrake. Now that I am an avid Mandrake user, I am still looking for it to change the world. I have never been convinced that Red Hat was the one.<br /><br />Welcome, officially, to the group. Jump in on discussions and post some questions for those in here that know what they are doing. <br /><br />I am just a conversationalist. I will talk with anyone, but not I am not much of technical help.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi Crowe. &nbsp;That's interesting. &nbsp;My first experience was with Slackware on disk as well. &nbsp;I had to buy 100 blank floppies and download of ftp.cdrom.com via my 14.4 modem. &nbsp;Took forever. &nbsp;I had fun learning linux though. &nbsp;It was frustrating at the time, not many books / sites providing help to newbies. &nbsp;A lot of &quot;RTFM!!!!&quot;, digging through man pages. &nbsp;The joys of being a computer nerd. :-D</div>
