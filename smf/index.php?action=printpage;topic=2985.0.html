					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi all,<br /><br />It&#039;s that time of year again.&nbsp; I have cut-n-pasted much of the same message from last year regarding the nomination and election process.&nbsp; Please read it and participate.<br /><br />It&#039;s time again to nominate Steering Committee members for the coming year.&nbsp; Please post your nominations in this thread.&nbsp; Be sure to include name (and/or forum name) and the position you wish to nominate this person for.&nbsp; If you have multiple nominations, please include them in a single post.<br /><br />The Steering Committee is a core group of LUG members who are responsible for the day-to-day running of P&#039;cola LUG. The positions are:<br /><br />1. President - responsible for inter-organizational contacts, organizing events, and presides over meetings.&nbsp; <b>Incumbent:&nbsp; danc</b><br /><br />2. Vice President - primary assistant to the President and responsible for President&#039;s duties, should the President be unavailable.&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Incumbent:&nbsp; imnes</b><br /><br />3. Secretary - responsible for intra-organizational communication, posting meeting notes, summaries, and announcements. Also responsible for forwarding/replying to email sent to info@pcolalug.org.&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Incumbent:&nbsp; green_dragon37</b><br /><br />4. Librarian - responsible for the P&#039;cola LUG library administration, &quot;review book&quot; ordering and distribution, and primary contact for O&#039;Reilly.&nbsp; <b>Incumbent: lloydr</b><br /><br />Two other positions - Webmaster and SysAdmin - are also part of the Steering Committee and are appointed by same. These folks are responsible for the maintenance of our website and hardware assets respectively.&nbsp; These two positions can be held by a single person.&nbsp; <b>Incumbents:&nbsp; Webmaster: Rugmonster&nbsp; &nbsp; SysAdmin: lloydr</b><br />&nbsp;<br />If you are nominated, please carefully consider your acceptance. <b>These positions take some time, effort, and commitment on your part.</b> It&#039;s not much, really, but please consider your other obligations. Talk to some of the current and/or former Committee members if you have specific questions about a position.&nbsp; Once you have decided to accept (or decline) the nomination, please post a reply in this thread to that effect!<br /><br />Nominations will be accepted from now until the <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">15th of September</span></b>. We will vote as a group at the September meeting (9/16). You must be present at the September meeting to vote, but you don&#039;t have to be there to win.&nbsp; The new committee should have all appointed positions filled and officially assume its duties on October 1st.<br /><br />Please take a minute to consider who you&#039;d like to see elected to help our LUG function and grow, and <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PLEASE set aside some time to make it to the September meeting to VOTE</span></b>!<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Dan<br />President, P&#039;cola LUG<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">As the first response, I&#039;d like to make it known that I will not accept any nominations for office this year.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got a new job, some new priorities, and don&#039;t want to compromise on any of them.&nbsp; Thanks for the support shown to me over the last year.&nbsp; I appreciate that, and will be seeing you around.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Dan<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I, as well, must pass the job of webmaster on to someone else. It&#039;s been fun, but life has a way of dictating new priorities. Don&#039;t worry though, I&#039;m not going anywhere.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I nominate green_dragon37 as President and Vice-President<br /><br />I am not around to know the new people. But let me say this. Those of you who are new, you are the future leaders of this group. Future? What does that mean? Than means September 16. We will vote on people to take the reigns of the group, that could, and should be you.<br /><br />As a founding/charter member of the group, I stay as active as I can. But, I no longer live in Pensacola, nor Florida, or even the USA. It is time for those of you who do live there to step up and take command. This is your opportunity. Maybe you have not been to a meeting yet. Make it a point to be there and let yourself be known.<br /><br />There is a commitment to the group, but we are not talking about hours each week. We are talking a few hours a month. You spend that much time reading the forums and thinking about being with the group. Just make it official and volunteer for a position. We would be glad to have you.<br /><br />Since the group is reletively young, no one has been in for decades. So don&#039;t feel awkward about volunteering for a position, because we are all pretty new around here.<br /><br />Just make sure that you will make all effort to be at as many meetings as you can. No one is asking you to be at all of them, but you should commit to being at the ones that are possible. When I was vice-president, I was traveling 3,000+ miles a month. I knew I would not be at every meeting, but was there when I could be and that is all that the group expects of you.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would like to see lloydr/seawolf_ retain the position of sysadmin, and perhaps take on the role of webmaster.&nbsp; He has the access to the machine, and a good knowledge of just exactly what is going on in the site now.<br /><br />Ian</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am throwing my hat in the arena for either V.P or Secretary depending on what the group needs!<br />I feel that my time will open up enough to allow me to work with the group again.<br />That was a major concern I had to look at before coming forward.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">OK, we are now just over a week away from the election.&nbsp; I wanted to summarize the nominations to this point, for ease of reading and remembering (some not shown due to declining their nomination):<br /><br />Nominees:<br /><br />President:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; green_dragon37, bhoff<br />VicePresident:&nbsp; green_dragon37, bhoff<br />Secretary:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; green_dragon37, bhoff<br />Librarian:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lloydr<br />Webmaster:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;lloydr<br />SysAdmin:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lloydr<br /><br />As the outgoing President, I would like to pledge my support as follows:<br />Pres:&nbsp; bhoff<br />VP and Sec:&nbsp; green_dragon37<br />Lib and Web and Sys:&nbsp; lloydr<br /><br />I regret that I won&#039;t be able to be at this important meeting (will be out of state for a funeral...ugh).&nbsp; I hope there is a good turnout for the voting.&nbsp; There is *STILL TIME* for anyone else to be nominated (or self-nominate themselves!) for one of the positions.&nbsp; As you can see there are fewer nominees than there are jobs....&nbsp; Come on, get involved!<br /><br />Good luck to all nominees, and thank you.<br />Dan<br /><br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Let me encourage people to step up. Some of you may have been out of touch with the group for a while. This is a chance to get back involved again. Some of you may be so new you have not even made it to a meeting. If you think you might be able to fill a position, then throw your name in. If no one knows you, they don&#039;t really know where you might fit. But you know. So get your name in the hat.<br /><br />Turn out for the meeting. I will throw in $20 for pizza. Let&#039;s make a party out of this. Get some good attendance and elect some officers. If you want to see the group go forward in a particular direction, then all you have to do is step up to the plate and let your voice be heard.<br /><br />Do we have a second on the motion of pizza party that night?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Don&#039;t get the wrong idea about the steering committee. It is all very informal. We basically just help make final decisions on when to hold LAN parties and settle general discussions for the entire group. Check out our by-laws to see what each position&#039;s responsibility is. Honestly, it isn&#039;t that much, especially if you plan on making meetings anyhow.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Even though I would like to become more involved with the Pensacola LUG after a long absence, I am currently not able to commit any time to steering committee level positions at this time.&nbsp; I second danc3&#039;s recommendations.</div>
