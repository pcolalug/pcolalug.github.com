					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The forums have been dormant for a while now, see if I can generate some discussion...<br /><br />What do you guys think about the movement towards a standard linux desktop across distributions? &nbsp;Some of the larger distros (like RedHat / Mandrake) are working hard to make their particular system more user friendly, but I would like to see some common organization / setup across distributions and window managers.<br /><br />RedHat's current move gives the user the same menu system across whatever Window Manager he chooses. &nbsp;That's a step in the right direction, but not enough. &nbsp;I think it should be standardized across distributions too. &nbsp;<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />What do you say to someone who calls up and says &quot;How do I get on the internet?&quot;<br /><br />If they are using Windows, you say &quot;Goto the Start Menu, Click on Programs, then click Internet Explorer.&quot;<br /><br />What if they ask the same question on Linux. &nbsp;Well, you would probably have to start interrogating them. &nbsp;&quot;What Distribution do you Have? &nbsp;What Version of that Distribution do you have? &nbsp;What Window Manager do you have? &nbsp;What programs did you install? &nbsp;Do you see a program called &quot;Mozilla&quot; in the menu anywhere? &nbsp;How about &quot;Konqueror&quot;? &nbsp;Or &quot; Opera&quot;, or &quot;Netscape&quot;? &nbsp;Or &quot;Lynx&quot;? &nbsp;Or ....&quot;<br /><br />And what if they can't find any of those programs? &nbsp;Time to figure out a way to explain to an average user of Windows about installling a browser, on their particular version of their particular distribution. &nbsp;Do they know what a &quot;root&quot; password is? &nbsp;Do they have compilers installed? &nbsp;What a mess!<br /><br />Now, I'm not saying that each distribution have to install the same software. &nbsp;But just use generic names and standard menu locations. &nbsp;RedHat has done this in their latest release. &nbsp;Getting on the internet is as easy as &quot;Click the Menu, click on Internet, cilck on Web Browser&quot;. &nbsp;I don't really care if netscape / mozilla / opera / konqueror / whatever starts up, they all work about the same. &nbsp;And I don't think most users really care what pops up either, after all they just want to browse the web.<br /><br />What are some of the other obstacles keeping &quot;Joe User&quot; from running Linux?<br /><br />How about Printer support. &nbsp;This is something else that is overly complicated in Linux. &nbsp;I consider myself a fairly knowledgable linux advocate, but even I have trouble figuring out how to cancel a confused print job on my system. &nbsp;<br /><br />Package Management is another area. &nbsp;People need an easy way to install (precompiled) packages and dependencies. &nbsp;If adopting a single package manager across the linux world could happen, I don't know which I would pick. &nbsp;RPM is nice, but not very convenient. &nbsp;I haven't used APT in a while, but doesn't it automatically install missing dependencies? &nbsp;Maybe APT with a nice easy GUI interface could be the answer? &nbsp;Something where a user can say &quot;Install an Instant Messanger&quot; or &quot;Upgrade to the Latest Web Browser&quot; and have it done. &nbsp;I dread having to walk someone through compiling a package and resolving dependencies, and I assume that most users wouldn't have the patience to try to handle it.<br /><br />And just to reiterate a point made in other discussions, we don't want a dumbed-down version of linux, but a linux desktop that is accessible, useful, and acceptable to the masses.<br /><br />It's easy to get fellow comp geeks to use linux. &nbsp;People who get a warm feeling from digging through source code, and compiling customized versions of programs optimized for their CPU. &nbsp;Building custom kernels to be as small as possible. &nbsp;All that stuff, well if you know how to do all that you shouldn't be affected by a generic desktop, 'cause you'll probably customized the heck out of it anyways.<br /><br />I think with a more centralized / standard desktop we would see more of the big software developers release linux apps. &nbsp;I think many of them stay away becuase they don't want the hassle of trying to provide customer support for a normal user trying to grasp an understanding of &quot;administrating&quot; their computer. &nbsp;Imagine a customer calling Macromedia about DreamWeaver-MX3 for Linux (wouldn't that be nice). &nbsp;&quot;Yeah, I just tried to install DW on my machine, but it's not in my menu. &nbsp;How do I get it?&quot; &nbsp;&quot;Well, what Window Manager are you running?&quot; &nbsp;&quot;What? &nbsp;I don't know, what are you talking about?&quot; &nbsp;Companies would get tired of answering support calls relating to the desktop that they probably couldn't answer, and customers would get tired of getting told &quot;That's not a question for us, that's something to do with your distribution. &nbsp;Contact the Window Maker / Debian Tech Support.&quot; &nbsp;People would get fed up and go back to MS-Windows and never give linux another thought.<br /><br />Back to the Window Managers. &nbsp;It's clear that people don't want one window manager to dominate. &nbsp;But why can't they share the same configuration and services? &nbsp;Every (major) window manager has a menu system. &nbsp;So why can't they share the configuration information for those? &nbsp;I want my newly installed program to show up in my menu reguardless of whether I'm in KDE, GNOME, WindowMaker, XFCE, or whatever else! &nbsp;Would it also be asking too much for them to share common configuration utilities? &nbsp;A common print manager and other usefuly utilities?<br /><br />And can I have a standard &quot;DESKTOP&quot; folder across window managers? &nbsp;Where I can have folders for my documents, pictures, music, downloads, and other stuff? &nbsp;(maybe that would be too Windows(TM)-like for some of you, I dunno ).<br /><br />Standardizing things in Linux to the point that the average windows - user could figure it out is the biggest obstacle standing in the way of the ultimate adoption of Linux by users and Software Developers.<br /><br />From a software developers point of view: &nbsp;It may be ideal, even easier, to write software for Linux than Windows, but customer support is too prohibitive. &nbsp;In fact most software currently available for linux doesn't really have tech support. &nbsp;You have to trolll through IRC channels and mailing lists and try to find answers to your questions. &nbsp;If I can't get &quot;Konqueror&quot; to work properly, who can I call to walk me through it? &nbsp;<br /><br />It looks like a lot of the problems are being addressed by the Linux Standards Base http://www.linuxbase.org/. &nbsp;They have some of the biggest names in the Linux world backing them, including Caldera, Debian, RedHat, IBM, Intel, SGI, Oracle, and others.<br /><br />Hopefully things will take shape soon. &nbsp;While Linux Distros are suffering with central problems like standardizing menu layout, Microsoft is working hard to innovate / change Windows to set it apart from the Linux offerings so that it will be harder for people to see Linux as an alternative, but as 'Old Technology'. &nbsp;&quot;Why do I want to use something that looks / works like Windows 95?&quot; &nbsp;<br /><br />Who knows, I look forward to the day I can install Linux on my mom's computer and she can just use it without help and hand-holding. &nbsp;It's definitely not there yet.<br /><br />Nick<br />imnes@go.com</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This is a problem/advantage of Linux. While standardized desktops, menus, printer management, and software installation makes things easier and may attract more people, the biggest attraction for Linux in the past has always been &quot;choice&quot;.<br /><br />Some examples are KDE, WindowMaker, Gnome. These desktops approach desktop management differently and each has it's pros and cons. Some people like one while other people like the others. <br /><br />Another example is RPM vs. Apt/Get vs. source code install. They all are different and have their advantages. &nbsp;Source code install allows you to compile for your specific system for more efficient operation while Apt/Get and RPM are precomiled for generic systems.<br /><br />Printer management seems to be settling on CUPS for a standard but there are still other choices out there.<br /><br />Remember, one of the biggest complaints the Linux users have against MS is that MS forces you to use a specific desktop with a specific layout and GUI interface. While this makes it easy to help someone over the phone it doesn't allow different folks to enjoy different desktops.<br /><br />Here's something to think about. What if all houses were layed out the same? It would be easy to help people over the phone making suggestions on how to move things around in the house or how to change something or fix that wall problem in the living room. But, on the other side people would get tired and ask why houses couldn't be designed differently. (That's where Linux comes in.)<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Good point, but I'm not saying lock people into a generic setup. &nbsp;Of course it's still Linux, power users can always custom compile, change layout, and customize things as they want. &nbsp;But I just think that having similiarities across distros would solve more problems than it would cause. &nbsp;At least I hope. &nbsp;:)<br /><br />Nick</div>

Also, I would sugguest that there be a change in the way installs work. Build the system in stages and according to function:<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><li>We will now set up your display renderer [XFree86]...</li><li>Now lets set up your sound server...</li><li>Now we will configure your internet access...[/list:u]At each stage, an xml file is being built in /etc/.services.conf or some such that will tell *all* apps what to use for such services. The settings for each service could be kept in its own config file, just like now, though I would like to see those all move to XML as well. <br />And it would be nice for the desktops to share menu configs as well. This being said, I think it would be a better solution for distros to go back to supporting a primary desktop, a-la RedHat/Gnome, Mandrake/KDE, Lycoris/KDE. I can, if I so desire, put alternate window managers on these systems, its just the config is up to me. &nbsp;This is where the distros are *supposed* to distinguish themselves, anyway, isn't it? Support nightmares aren't as bad, and your interrogation boils down to the distro. &nbsp;Besides, I use KDE because I like how it looks and behaves better than Gnome. &nbsp;I don't want a KDE that looks and acts like Gnome.<br />Ok, and not to stir the pot or anything, but does it *have* to be mindless? &nbsp;The reason I got into OSS was the feeling of accomplishment I get when something works when I have taken the time and effort to figure it out. &nbsp;There *are* distros that cater to the newb that just wants to surf the web(Lycoris (http://www.lycoris.com), again), but that doesn't mean that they *all* have to, or even that they all should. I've seen Mandrake and SuSE target the middle of the road, technically proficient power-user, while Gentoo and Debian are hard-core. &nbsp;I'm not really sure *who* RedHat is for these days, but I would guess that it is the business folks.<br />I guess that the point of all of this is that I really don't think that all distros should try and be all things to all people. Pick a niche and cater to that kind of user. However, I do think some behind the scenes compatability would be welcome. &nbsp;Anyone want to hack the xml-config idea? &nbsp;:)</li></ul></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: imnes</div><div class="quote">The forums have been dormant for a while now</div><br />That is because I have not had internet access for a week or so. I will try and be in some this week.<br /><br />I am not against a standard look and feel, but I don't think it is going to happen. I also beleive that Linux can thrive without the standardization of desktops, though it will be slowed greatly. <br /><br />As was previously discussed, we will not see them use the same config utilities, which is just too bad. I think that the best we can hope for is that the Distro will make a common config tool between desktops. I guess Mandrake does that with MCC, though I have not used it for Gnome.<br /><br />You mention CUPS. I think that it is a great tool, but it is far from being easy to use. I guess it is better than setting up printers used to be. I at least have a couple of printers working in Linux now that I did not have before. But, it still was not simple like setting up a printer in Windows.<br /><br />Linux is still just difficult. I admit, it has come a long way, but it ain't easy yet. Standardizing desktops and utilities will help, but I don't think that is all it will take to get Linux on the desktop. It will take making things much simpler.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Great points everyone.<br /><br />I especially like the XML suggestion. &nbsp;I haven't dug into it to check for myself, but I think Gnome2 has made all their menu files in XML.<br /><br />Has anyone used Mac OS/X? &nbsp;I haven't even seen it in person, how is it to use? &nbsp;An article (maybe on slashdot) stated boldly that FreeBSD is the most popular *nix distro for the desktop (or at least has the largest install base) because of Mac OS/X. &nbsp;(I thought it was based on NetBSD, but maybe their using FreeBSD generically to cover them all). &nbsp;Seems they've taken BSD which, like linux, is a pain for the non-tech users to handle, and they market it as the slickest, most user-friendly operating system available. &nbsp;How did they pull it off? &nbsp;Are their programs so simple that grandma could figure it out? &nbsp;Can you customize anything on the systems?<br /><br />Just throwing these questions out there, can anyone comment on it?<br /><br />Nick<br />imnes@go.com</div>

The site (http://www.apple.com/macosx/) has some interesting diagrams of the system if you grep around for 'em. Basically what they have done is take a (non RISC-based (http://www.macslash.org/article.pl?sid=02/10/21/1244217), if you can believe it) Mach microkernel with FreeBSD on top. IIRC, on top of that is the Cocoa application layer and the Aqua presentation layer. It is the latter two that give the OS its user-friendlyness, while allowing access to the UNIX core underneath.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">How about some behind-the-scenes abstraction for programmers. &nbsp;To solve problems like installing applications in X. &nbsp;For example, a programmer writes an IRC program, and wants it added to the Internet application menu, with an icon 'irc.xpm', and a link to his program at '/usr/bin/irc'. &nbsp; He writes his own installation program that installs his program and support files wherever, but when it comes time to add it to the menu system, he calls a helper program, say 'add-my-x-app.sh', tells it the location of his binary file, what icon to use, what group of programs this belongs in, etc. &nbsp;That helper function would then take care of setting it up (each distro would be responsible for writing their own version of that helper script which would take care of updating the menu system for it's Window Manager<del>.) &nbsp;<br /><br />I have never written a software installer for X so I dont know first-hand if these sort of problems even exist. &nbsp;I believe they do though, because I have installed several programs with the option of 'include in my KDE/GNOME menu' and the program never shows up.<br /><br />This could be done for all sorts of things though. &nbsp;Like alleviating the user from having to constantly configure programs to work with his particular sound server. &nbsp;A script like 'xplaysound.sh' could be called whenever a sound should be played, and it would take care of calling artsplay or esdplay, or just play depending on what sound server is being used.<br /><br />A little tired from doing 5 hours of Calculus homework, is any of this making sense?<br /><br />Nick</del></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">So, some sort of software management layer, eh? Call it the Installer. It would have to handle rpm, deb/apt, and source (of the ./configure, make, make install, make clean variety), of course. Again, it would have to keep an xml database of installed software, catagories and the like. Hmm. &nbsp;Sounds like what RPM, apt, and portage are all striving for seperately. &nbsp;What our system does, then, is plug into the global menu spec and software db? &nbsp;Of course, the kicker will be getting the shared config stuff hacked into KDE and Gnome (with others to follow if it works out).</div>

The app just calls the, oh, I don't know, GlobalMediaObject-&gt;PlaySound(&amp;file, mime-type) or some such.
