					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I'm typing from my Windows machine as my Linux system is dead. Trying to troubleshoot a memory problem last night, I decided to flash the bios to the latest version. Per Asus' instructions I downloaded the bios file to a floppy, inserted it into the drive and booted the system. I was really happy because Asus has an Eazy-Flash utility where all you have to do is hit &quot;Alt-F2&quot; during post and it'll update the bios from the floppy. I did that. The system said &quot;Reading Rom image. &nbsp;Erasing Rom. &nbsp; ROM Update Failed!&quot;<br /><br />Well, I started getting nervous. I left it at the last line for about a half hour, praying that it would come back and say &quot;SIKE!&quot;. It didn't. I reset the machine and guess what? Nothing! No display. No Boot. Nothing. I then used my other (Windows) system to search the net. It seems that others have had this same problem. Solution: Don't use the Asus Eazy-Flash upgrade. BTW: I HAD and Asus K8VSE Deluxe AMD64 board.<br />If you check Asus site, on the ROM version before this one, there is a not to use the Bios upgrade software for that upgrade. However, there's no such note for the latest upgrade.. &quot;Thanks Asus&quot;<br /><br />Anyway, went to NewEgg today and ordered an AOPEN AK86-L motherboard shipped overnight express. It’s pretty much the same but for about 1/3 the cost. It also has some good reviews in the Linux world.<br /><br />Well, it looks like I've got another Motherboard manufacturer to stay away from....<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">BTW, since my new motherboard will be using the same chipset and I'm using IDE drives, I shouldn't have a problem booting up after replacing the the motherboard. Right?<br />Everything I read on the net has stated that while Windows may have problems, Linux is much better when it comes to swapping hardware.<br /><br />BTW, it'll be the same processor, memory, etc.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I had a similar issue. I used the Windows utility for upgrading the BIOS on my Asus K8V Deluxe. There was one version that said not to use that utility, but that was once you dug into the site. Well, I applied it and rebooted the system expecting the best. I had a very similar problem. Nothing happened. Me and my friend bought our systems at the same time and have nearly identical pieces, so we did this both at the same time. After a little brainstorming, we pulled the CMOS battery and unplugged the system to try to reset the values there. After replacing the battery and turning it back on, we had to reconfigure the settings in the CMOS, but all was fine. Turns out, there were several changed values in the CMOS that somehow messed up the boot process. Clearing the values for the older BIOS made it use the defaults and all was well in the world. <br /><br />I think my next motherboard will have a second, on board BIOS, just for times like that.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You know I would like to find a motherboard maker with superb linux support.<br /><br />Right now I have a via motherboard, they're supposed to have excellent linux support, but really, they don't. (at least for non rpm distrobutions)<br /><br />Some time in the future i might decide to upgrade, and when i do I want a fully supported motherboard.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sorry to hear about your woes there steve. Isn't there a way to use another machine to make a simple dos-like boot floppy that includes a bios flash utility and the image and repair your mobo with that? I just refuse to believe that that thing is dead forever because of this. Worst case, you could order a new chip, but I doubt that's nessisary.<br /><br />As for mobo's and Linux, I have had nothing but good experiences with Via boards, though I don't *evah* buy one with integrated sound/video/network if I can avoid it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Have you actually tried installing the drivers off the site in linux (slackware)?<br /><br />It's not fun, and not very productive. &nbsp;Granted it works like a champ, just don't expect anything from the onboard networking (bcm4400, linux has an &quot;experimental&quot; driver for it)<br /><br />Then again I'm not in any true rush to upgrade to be honest with you. &nbsp;As long as I can play americas army, UT, and ET, I'm fine. <br /><br />Heh, I have no problem running older hardware. &nbsp;Do yall remember when I was on my 486 last year? &nbsp;kinda fun actually.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have a motherboard that has a backup CMOS thingy. It is great for restoring the computer back to working. I have had to use it once. The downside is that once every few weeks it decides that there is a setting wrong and it wants to restore the CMOS. It goes through the motions of doing it and the computer comes back up, but it never changes the settings.<br /><br />This is my NForce based board. Don't remember the brand, nor do I want to crawl on the floor to find out.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The thing with the &quot;CrashFree&quot; is that you have to get the system to boot up far enough to check the BIOS. Mine wouldn't even get there and I would imagine, Steve's isn't either. He said he's getting a black screen and nothing else.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">My Chaintech has been awesome, it's a nForce 3 type and hasn't complained to Linux at all about anything.<br /><br />This is sad to hear though as it'll make about the third mention of ASUS having a problem in recent memory for me. &nbsp;The last two were from a friend of mine who discovered, painfully, that the ASUS board he got (something high-powered, can't remember) didn't like non-ASUS graphics cards. &nbsp;In fact, it'd crash randomly within about twenty seconds to two minutes, if it came up at all.<br /><br /><br />So far I haven't been too impressed by ASUS. &nbsp;For me Chaintech seems to do just fine with their products: &nbsp;no, not the &quot;best,&quot; but there's something to be said for compatibility and reliability.</div>
