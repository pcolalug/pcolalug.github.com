					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">At work today, my boss mentioned that he heard something about the city of Pensacola possibly migrating to open source technologies.&nbsp; I told him I thought that one of the lug members was involved working with the city on their migration.&nbsp; Although I&#039;m not certain that my memory was correct.&nbsp; Brett, were you involved with the city&#039;s migration to open source?&nbsp; I apologize if I got my wires crossed and didn&#039;t remember correctly.&nbsp; It wouldn&#039;t be the first time.<br /><br />Anyway, my boss is very interested in hearing more about how open source technologies might benefit our organization.&nbsp; We are a large health care provider and have large investments in technology.&nbsp; Of course, I have been vigilant in preaching the open source gospel in our department.&nbsp; However, I think my boss hearing about the city migrating to open source really got his attention.<br /><br />Brett if you were involved in the city&#039;s migration, and are interested in doing a presentation for our IT department, please get back with me for more info and some possible dates.&nbsp; My boss isn&#039;t in a big hurry for the presentation but he asked me to go ahead and put the word out.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Actually that was me! :)<br /><br />And I gave a presentationt to UWF last wednesday night and a young man that work&#039;s with you was preaching Linux to your boss. By the name of Peter. I can put some migration presentation together and meet with them if they are interested and probally get them into&nbsp; talk to the IT dept at the city to see how it is going for them.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That&#039;s cool.<br />You can tell your boss that a lot of municipalities have made the switch to open source. :) There are some lists in various places (I know Debian keeps one for that distro).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey Brett this would be that UWF student that was preaching Linux :-) So I was wondering how you thought the exploratory meeting at Lakeview went the other day? Did Mike seem like it may be something of interest to consider in the future?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Without getting to much ahead of myself and the Open source movement.<br />I feel that Mike was ver receptive and open minded. I am dropping off ubuntu disk this week to them.</div>
