					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Got an email this morning relavent for SUSE fans...<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 16pt; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Your Linux is ready</b></span><br /><br />(http://www.novell.com/img/hdr/launch_header.jpg)<br /><br />Today Novell is announcing a major milestone in the evolution of Linux and one of the most important product launches in our company&#039;s history. Introducing SUSE Linux Enterprise 10, The Platform for the Open Enterprise. As we like to say, Your Linux is Ready. Ready for you as our customer to take full advantage of this powerful technology.<br /><br />SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 is the best engineered, lowest cost, and most interoperable platform for enterprise computing. It is an enterprise-wide offering that effectively takes Linux from the desktop (with SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop), to the data center (with SUSE Linux Enterprise Server). This transformational technology offers far more than cost savings. Industry experts, our partners, and of course you—our customers—are telling us now—more than ever—Linux is about performance, reliability, scalability, and manageability. That&#039;s why SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 is so important. It&#039;s the right product at the right time.<br /><br />SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is engineered to handle &quot;bet your business&quot; workloads in the data center. It&#039;s open, scalable, and offers integrated application security, virtualization and systems management. Network Computing Magazine calls it &quot;Linux without tears.&quot; They go on to say it &quot;provides a solid foundation for a vast array of enterprise level systems.&quot;<br /><br />SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop is living proof that Linux is ready for use as a general-purpose desktop. We&#039;re not the only ones who agree. After a test drive, InfoWorld Magazine said &quot;Novell hits a home run with SLED 10.&quot; CRN Magazine tested SLED 10 versus Microsoft Windows Vista. They liked what they saw and readers have downloaded the results over 100,000 times—a record number for a story in their publication.<br /><br />In support of these products we&#039;re introducing the Novell Customer Center, an intuitive online interface for our customers to manage all business and technical interactions with Novell. From one location, organizations can review the status of all their Novell products, subscriptions and services, as well as receive critical Linux updates and support.<br /><br />We&#039;ll be bringing you more information about these products over the coming weeks. In the meantime I encourage you to visit our website at: www.novell.com/linux. There you&#039;ll find a wide range of information and resources.<br /><br />Novell is committed to delivering value to you by being among the world&#039;s best enterprise software companies. We do that by leveraging the best that open source has to offer, providing an array of commercial software, working within the realities of your heterogeneous IT environment, and bringing truly new technologies to help you solve your business problems. That said, we only do that when the technology and solutions are ready. I&#039;m proud to say &quot;Your Linux is Ready&quot; and we&#039;re happy to announce it officially today.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Ron<br /><br />Ronald W. Hovsepian<br />President and Chief Executive Officer<br />Novell, Inc.<br /><br /></div>
