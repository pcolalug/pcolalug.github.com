					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well no getting around it, I need Microsoft Office for some school related stuff. &nbsp;And I didn't like the option of buying Crossover Office. &nbsp;So I built wine, installed Office 97 Pro, and so far it works great (everything except Access which doesn't start, but I don't need it). &nbsp;<br /><br />I planned to get Office 2k installed but my CD is missing. &nbsp;If I find it I'll give it a try. &nbsp;I tried Office XP but it failed early in the installation and I didn't pursue it any more. &nbsp;I got the functionality I need now and I'll probably just leave it at that. &nbsp;But if anyone else needs to use it, just letting you know that you don't have to go buy Crossover Office to do it :)<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Curious, what do you need Office to do that OO.o can't do (or not do the way you need it)? <br /><br />I am an OpenOffice.org evangelist. Whatever it can't do for you, let me know and I will see if I can add that to my next comment list that is getting ready to be sent to the OO.o folks.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've had some annoyances with a few Word documents not being rendered properly. &nbsp;But that's ok. &nbsp;The one big feature I can't find (maybe I don't know where to look) are different print layouts for PowerPoint presentations. &nbsp;I print out slides for all my classes in a handouts + notes format, basically it shrinks down your slides, and prints them down the left side of the page (3 to a page) and the right side has blank lines for jotting down notes.<br /><br />Something like<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"><br /><br />+--------------------------+<br />| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;__________ &nbsp;|<br />| &nbsp;********* &nbsp; __________ &nbsp;|<br />| &nbsp;* SLIDE * &nbsp; __________ &nbsp;|<br />| &nbsp;********* &nbsp; __________ &nbsp;|<br />| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;__________ &nbsp;|<br />| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;__________ &nbsp;|<br />| &nbsp;********* &nbsp; __________ &nbsp;|<br />| &nbsp;* SLIDE * &nbsp; __________ &nbsp;|<br />| &nbsp;********* &nbsp; __________ &nbsp;|<br />| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;__________ &nbsp;|<br />| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;__________ &nbsp;|<br />| &nbsp;********* &nbsp; __________ &nbsp;|<br />| &nbsp;* SLIDE * &nbsp; __________ &nbsp;|<br />| &nbsp;********* &nbsp; __________ &nbsp;|<br />| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />+--------------------------+<br /><br /><br /></div><br /><br /><br />If the option is in there, please tell me where to look :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I found a way to do what you want.<br /><br />The presentation package is the one major disappointment to me in the OO.o package. Don't tell anyone, but I think the best program that Microsoft has ever made (and probably ever will) is PowerPoint. OO.o Presentations is not quite there. But...it does work, and I have done several presentations with it. It is just not as slick as PowerPoint. I don't know why they have not learned from PowerPoint. It is intuitive, it works, things are easy to figure out and do exactly what you want. That is not a description of any of their other software.<br /><br />But, back to the question.<br /><br />Open your presentation. Go to &quot;Handout View.&quot; (This is the 5th icon from the top on the right hand side just above the scroll up arrow). <br /><br />(If the page is already portriate, then skip this step.)<br />Right click on the page that has your slides up and tell it to go to portriate orientation.<br /><br />Format | Modify Layout. Click the one that will give you three slides up. <br /><br />Select the slides and move them over to the left.<br /><br />This will give you exacly what you are looking for, but without the lines. You can add lines with the lines tool from the left toolbar. Once done, this should work everytime with that presentation. <br /><br />When you print. Select Options at the bottom left. Select &quot;Handouts.&quot;<br /><br />There may be a way to make this your default handout layout, but I have not found it yet.<br /><br />Hope this helps.</div>
