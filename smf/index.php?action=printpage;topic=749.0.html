					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">To continue the trend of predictable gaming conversation started in this (http://www.pcolalug.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=3271) thread, what are some of your most memorable gaming moments?<br /><br />For me, the one that really sticks out is the ending to Wing Commander 3. It was so unexpected, sorrowful, but rewarding, I couldn't get that last cutscene out of my head for weeks. That game was a seminal event in gaming to me. It really made me feel involved in the story and care about my comrades. The fact that Ginger Lynn Allen starred in it helped too! ;)<br /><br /><b>CAUTION! Half-Life spoiler - sort of</b> (Ok, you *really* should have played this game by now, and if you haven't, log out, go get it, and don't come back 'till you are done!)<br />There are also moments in Half-Life that really exemplify the best gaming can be. Turning the corner, seeing the elevator shaft and a way out at the end of the hall, and BOOM here comes a monster, breaking through a boarded up door to get to you. I f-r-e-a-k-e-d! Then and there I knew this game was everything they said it would be.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have to agree with Wing Commander 3. And Ginger Lynn was some nice eye candy. Too bad she didn't bring out her main skillz...but then it wouldn't have been the same game.<br /><br />Final Fantasy 3 was my favorite RPG. I played it over and over and was actually drawn into the story. It wasn't about leveling up, it was about saving the world. Also on the console front, anyone remember that mech game that used the big light bazooka thing? I played that game for hours also.<br /><br />Another game that completely drew me in was System Shock 2. Holy crap. I could play this game for all of about 20 minutes at the most before I was too freaked out. Immersive, yes. Intense, yes. Make you soil you shorts, oh yes.<br /><br />Half Life is just one of those absolutely great games. It is timeless. In fact, everything about that game is timeless. Look at Counter Strike. A Half Life mod, but still one of the most popular multiplayer games out there...and how old is that engine? I personally can't wait for Half Life 2. The ending of Half Life was weak, so I expect something strong from the sequel.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'd say one of my more memorable moments was the first time I was actually *scared* by a game. &nbsp;It was in the original Doom game, and one of those bald-pink-hunchback-dog creatures jumped out of nowhere, complete with terrifying growling sound, and started chewing on me. &nbsp;I jumped and was almost paralyzed for a few seconds. &nbsp;I believe my heart actually stopped beating for a brief time. &nbsp;Ever since then whenever I run across one of those monsters, a chill runs down my spine. &nbsp;No kidding.<br /><br />Another one was the first time I won a round of online Duke Nukem 3D. &nbsp;Had spent quite a while losing rounds, and this confirmed for me that I was getting better at things.<br /><br />Other (multiple) occasions include the rounds of DN3D played with Narsil (and others), sometimes lasting hours. &nbsp;One map in particular, named &quot;Chico&quot; was an all-out fragfest where you could kill (or die) about 10 times in 10 seconds sometimes. &nbsp;We would play until someone got 100 kills in the round, and when done, would be sweating and tired (especially the wrist and mouse hand), with your heart pounding from adrenaline.<br /><br />More recently, the first time successfully carrying the documents from the warroom to the radio room in the Beach map of RTCW was enjoyable.<br /><br />Overall I've gotten a lot of enjoyment from playing computer games. &nbsp;Makes me feel like I don't ever need to grow up, which can be a Good Thing.<br /><br />Dan</div>

Awsome moment. For me, it was the AliensTC total conversion mod for Doom. When Heather and I lived in Tallahassee, me and a buddy spent an afternoon getting this mod to work for Doom II. We then proceeded to play this thing for about 8 hours straight. That first level showed the true power of the medium to evoke emotion, and the most impressive thing to me was that even though <b>there isn't a single enemy in the <i>entire</i> level</b>, we were scared like little girls!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This one is easy for me. &nbsp;Got freaked out by those half dead creepy things in the tunnels of RTCW in single player mode. &nbsp;Was low on ammo going in and they are up close with really evil sounds. &nbsp;They come in crouched low like a rabid dog, can't get away from them, lights dim, axes and claws all over. &nbsp;The sound is what really gets you, .... bad. &nbsp;After 10 years in the US Navy submarine service, I don't freak out easily, but I wanted to jerk my hands off keyboard and just get away from the screen when they came howling out of nowhere at me like furies. &nbsp;If you don't have RTCW, go buy it. &nbsp;It is pretty low cost. &nbsp;Will take you days to get through single player, and the ugly hateful thing at the end will freeze your blood. &nbsp;After that, the multi player part will entertain you for life.<br /><br />Best moment?: &nbsp;Winning in Duke 3D level that I had created. &nbsp;Full of monsters, like hundreds of them. &nbsp;(Moria Mine Map)<br /><br />Worst moment?: &nbsp;Losing in Duke 3D level that I had created. &nbsp;I mean for crying out loud, I made the map level, and still got beat by some guy who never saw it before.<br /><br />Narsil</div>
