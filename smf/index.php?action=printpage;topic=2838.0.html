					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">They say the first step is to admit you have a problem.&nbsp; As I said, my name&#039;s Noah.&nbsp; I am a full time psychology student at UWF, and I also work full time at Eat! in downtown Pensacola.&nbsp; I have given a great deal of consideration to converting over to Linux on my Dell Inspiron 9100 laptop.&nbsp; I have had numerous BSOD with XP, and am quite unhappy with it.<br /><br />That said, I have a modest, if lenghty experience with computers.&nbsp; I&#039;m 30, and have been doing the computer thing since I was 10 or 11, way back in the day of my Comodore Vic-20, C64, and the Apple IIe and Atari computers.&nbsp; The older I get (and I guess this is true with everyone), the more I find that I&#039;m not as savvy as I once was.&nbsp; I guess you could say I&#039;m a hobbyist who doesn&#039;t stay on top of trends.&nbsp; However, I have done a little research, and played with Knoppix a little, and looked at a couple of distributions.&nbsp; For some reason I can&#039;t get a good burn with the latest Knoppix distro, the boot hangs up while it&#039;s uncompressing some archived file.&nbsp; I have a couple of accounts of various folk installing Linux on their Dell 9100s, so I have something to work with.&nbsp; I hope to meet up with you, get a little help and advice, and establish some friendships.&nbsp; I will gladly trade beer for advice on setting this thing up as a dual boot Ubuntu Linux/XP box - I think I ought to at least have XP as a back-up in case I&#039;m stuck real bad.&nbsp; Also, there is a game due out next week that I am eager to play and have been waiting on for about 4 years - wiping Microsoft off my hard drive will need to wait until I can figure out how to play it on a Linux machine.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m bringing along a box of DOS/Windows games for your perusal to take away or trade, and perhaps a six pack of beer.&nbsp; Any votes on the beer?.&nbsp; Assuming I can make it on the 15th, which shouldn&#039;t be hard.<br /><br />Well, thanks for providing a service to forlorn computer users like myself.&nbsp; Can&#039;t wait to meet you.<br /><br />Yours,<br /><br />Noah</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Noah,<br /><br />Welcome, and glad to see you are thinking about using Linux!&nbsp; As luck would have it (and you apparently already know), our next meeting is this coming Saturday.&nbsp; This month we are also doing a LAN Party and Installfest, and it runs from 2-10pm, so we should be able to get things working smoothly for you.&nbsp; More details and directions are available in the link on the front page of the website.<br /><br />Look forward to meeting you, and again, welcome aboard.<br /><br />Dan<br /></div>
