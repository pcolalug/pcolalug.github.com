					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have been doing a lot of Windows admin recently and working with Windows quite a bit. I know I have been one of the biggest Linux supporters since I joined the boards, but I'm beginning to find myself moving away from the Linux for Everything belief. Believe it or not, I'm finding that I like Windows and Microsoft products in some instances better than I do most open solutions. So I have to ask, do you use Linux and open/free solutions for the simple principle of using free/open software or when it's practical? Maybe this has been asked before, but I just want to see what the general thought is among the group. Oh yeah, also explain your position. Maybe we can get some good inputs on this and I can have enough to write a paper on this subject when I get back in school this summer/fall.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I use open source because it's practical to me, my gaming system/workstation is slackware 9.1(2.6.0 kernel) and I dual boot with windows 2000 once maybe every few months maybe to play a round of battlefield 1942. I can do everything I need and want in linux so no need for windoze. I play America's Army-Special Forces, ET now, watch movies with xine, listen to music in xmms, use Licq and gaim for messengers, use TS2, gftp, mozilla for my browser and email, openoffice or staroffice for office suite, do graphic work in gimp(i'd like to get ahold of crossover office and get photoshop CS going lol), bluefish and gedit for html/php, and a few other programs I use here and there....but as far as being practical, using linux for me is more practical than windoze....<br /><br />1) the software I use mainly already comes with my distro of choice, slack<br />2) the software that doesnt come with slack I can easily install without hassle of asking for a cdkey, purchasing, or some stupid registration process<br />3) I can leave my system in linux and not worry about getting the latest M$ exploit patches and all that crap lol<br />4) It's quite a bit faster and more responsive than any version of windoze<br />5) gaming performance for the games I do like and play is much better in Linux<br /><br />also I use linux for my ftp server, http server, TS2 servers, game servers on occasions, and also as my home router/firewall<br /><br />so for all of my uses, it's much more practical to use Linux for them than windoze....especially for my servers and home router/firewall because who would want a M$ system attempting to protect your network? or who would want an M$ iis server up for your http server compared to an apache server? lol<br /><br />p.s. I also prefer not seeing the blue screen of death other than on my screensaver &nbsp;:lol: &nbsp;I hate being forced to reboot lol it's a waste of time &nbsp;:wink:<br /><br />also if anyone has gotten battlefield 1942 and desert combat to work in winex, gimme a hollar....if I can have success with that then I'll be single booting slackware ONLY! lol</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I use Linux for most stuff (95%) when I am home. I use Windows for most stuff (99.99%) when I am on the road. Difference? I have an Internet connection that works in Linux at home, but not when I am traveling.<br /><br />My gammut of &quot;must have&quot; apps include: OpenOffice.org, Firebird, Thunderbird, Gaim. These all run in Windows and Linux. I have one database that currently lives in Windows only. I use it once a month. I can export the data and work with it in Linux, but it looks nice in Windows, so that is where it stays.<br /><br />There is nothing I <b>need</b> Windows for except...GAMES. Currently, since my favorite game is ET I could do anything in Linux that I needed to (even get to my database if I really wanted). But for the most part, the games I like to play are Windows based.<br /><br />I use Linux mostly out of practicality. I like to mess with stuff (my wife thinks I just like to mess up stuff). Because of my desire to change stuff all the time, Linux has put life back into computing. I cannot afford/don't choose to buy the new version of Windows and Microsoft products every time they come out. With Linux I can install a new distro every week for the rest of my life and never run out of options. <br /><br />I don't think Microsoft is an &quot;evil monopoly.&quot; In fact, I think it is great that Bill Gates can make a bazillion dollars off of the general public by putting out inferior products. But he is not going to get my money if I can help it. <br /><br />I think Linux is far superior in one area: stability. Other than that, open source guys really need to work on making their software work like the OS model says it should. Really, much of the OS projects out there are just that, a project not a useable program. They cannot seriously think that businesses are going to choose their project over a commercial product that does the same thing, but in a better way.<br /><br />Examples of good OS projects:<br />OpenOffice.org<br />Mozilla<br />Firebird<br />Thunderbird<br /><br />Examples of bad ones:<br />The GIMP<br />Any Quicken replacement<br />Countless scores of really half baked projects<br /><br />The GIMP is great, but it has been in it's current state with minor adjustments/developments for years. Years. YEARS! Not months. Yes, it works, but the UI is awful IMO. Any company that is serious about bringing in the best designers is going to choose Photoshop over The GIMP. Who wants to teach that awful UI?<br /><br />Quicken replacement. There have been many that have tried and failed. Not because they don't do the math right, but the UI once again. Sure there are some improved ones out there. But this is a program that my wife would use. Why would I make her go back to Windows 3.1 days of UI to do something that she currently can do with nice looking software?<br /><br />UI is the biggest problem I have with many Linux programs. The ones I like are mostly because of their UI. Firebird is far better than IE. That one is a no brainer. If someone would give Firebird a try for a week and only learned how to use tabbed browsing, they would never want to go back to IE. I have tried other browsers that use tabbed browsing, but none of them quite do it as well as Firebird. Plus all the other features that Firebird gives you. UI will keep me using this product.<br /><br />OO.o is a wash on UI. I have not used Microsoft Office enough to know anything about it in 14 years or so. Therefore I really cannot comment about the UI in it. It works well for me. I &nbsp;understand the program and think that the UI is at least workable. The UI may not be the same as Office, but who says Microsoft has the best UI in the world?<br /><br />Thunderbird is a wash as well to me. I really like the program, especially since the 0.4 version came out. I don't know that it is necessarily superior to OE, but it is at least as good as. The UI is useable.<br /><br />Other programs may work, but the interface is horrid. There are some things I really hate about every window manager I have tried in Linux. My environment of choice is KDE. But there are some things that are just awful there. Linux suffers because there is not enough emphasis placed on UI. Sure the OS program may be better and be able to do more, but if you cannot figure out how to do what you want, or you can't stand looking at the ugly interface, what is going to keep you using the program?<br /><br />I use Linux for several reasons. I like the OS model. But until some work is done on the UI, it will not be on the desktop of every computer in the world.<br /><br />EDIT: I have to agree with Lloyd that Linux is absolutely necessary for any kind of server application. I would never consider a Windows based server of anything. Even just a simple file server.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: lloydr</div><div class="quote">I dunno about linux having a bad UI, or that gimps UI is bad either</div><br />Why would you want Photoshop then? I guess Photoshop does some things that The GIMP can't do. It seems to me that The GIMP has had time to catch up. Maybe Photoshop does things a little better than The GIMP. But I still think The GIMP's UI is pretty bad. I use it some. And it is a good powerful program, but it is not Photoshop. Beings that it is an OS project, then everytime Photoshop comes out with a new version with new features, we should see a new version of The GIMP come out about a week later with all the new stuff integrated. That is the power of OS. But the reality of the OS world is that it does not happen that well. Except the Linux kernel where we see new updates daily.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: lloydr</div><div class="quote"><br />I'm happier using my desktop and it's UI than ANY windoze system this is my slackware desktop, and I've had a lot of windoze users actually find interest in it over their 98se/2k/xpos desktops...</div><br />But have they actually used it to do work? I know there is alot of talk about whether we could move to Linux more easily if we were not influenced by Windows. And that Linux's UI is better than Windows. But the truth is that the vast majority of computer users in the US will be influenced by Windows. I don't think your average Windows user will be able to jump right into a windowing environment in Linux and say that it is better. Take interest? Yes. Want to commit to it overnight? Probably not.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: lloydr further</div><div class="quote"><br />I personally cant stand the UI of windoze, IE, OE, or any of the office programs.....also they each have their own major bugs and exploits LOL especially the first 3 of those list &nbsp;:wink: </div><br />I totally agree there. In fact that should be another area that I should have listed with the stability of Linux is the fact that there are not nearly as many virii written for it.<br /><br />Thanks for starting this Ruggy, we have not had a good discussion going lately. Of course alot of what we say here will just be a re-hash of what we have said before.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I use linux because of the principle. &nbsp;I use linux 5% of the time. I, of course, use windows 95% of the time. I think that Windows is a better operating system at this point because of two reason (one major and one minor). <br /><br />The first reason is because it is a house hold name. 90% of software developed is for this operating system. Therefore, MS offers more as a os for individual user. I have not been able to use linux for everything I do in windows. This is a big deterent and of course weighs heavy percentage wise. Please understand that this is not that I use musicjukebox to listen to mp3 and I don't want to try the linux software that will do the same thing. I am talking about types of software that has not even considered linux yet.<br /><br />The second reason is because of the plug and play. I do not like having to RTFM everytime I want to do something new. <br /><br />The reasons I use linux is because I think it has a future. It does not fulfill all of my needs. However, I do think that in the future it will. This is the main reason I use linux. To help promote the idea to the masses. I would love to see the different linux distribution rival MS. I love technology. I believe that health competition lights the fire under invention and discovery.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">for those who think there isnt much software developed for the linux box compared to a windoze<br />http://linuxshop.ru/linuxbegin/win-lin-soft-en/table.shtml<br /><br />also to dpeach, theres much more programs that stand out in my mind that are good projects that arent just there for a purpose of saying they made something to compare to windoze based software.....a few are Licq, XMMS, Xine(some would say mplayer instead right? lol &nbsp;:wink: ), gaim, those who use Ximian would probaly say it too but i personally cant comment since I prefer mozilla mail...and the gimp has its place and time, personally I prefer having both photoshop and the gimp together...dont like one over another but having both at same time gives you a big advantage if you use filters in graphics work with either one of them....photoshop has nice 3rd party addon filters that are awesome in certain cases while the script-fu/filter setup in the gimp works great in other cases....if i looked more for the gimp replacements for the photoshop scripts and filters like bladepro and eyecandy4000, i would be set since I like the layout of the tools better in the gimp lol<br /><br />also, mozilla mail and even Ximian(aint used it much though hehe) have a lot of extras over outlook and outlook express.....a big one is having much MUCH less number of exploits &nbsp;:lol:<br /><br />ooh yea, as far as just talking about open source projects....a nice project I found great for working with compressed file.... i found it on sourceforge a while back, 7-Zip...works with a lot of different compressed file formats....its for windoze but it's an open source program that replaces winzip &nbsp;by a LONGSHOT lol and also works with compressed files that generally only people on *nix based machines could uncompress lol</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would agree that there are some projects that are pretty good. But things like DVD and MP3 playback are very basic to me. I don't really care about the program that plays back my DVDs as long as it works. I am interested in the movie and not the program. I would rather not even know there was a program that existed. Just plug in the DVD and watch my movie. Same with MP3 playback. You can say that the OS apps for those are better than the commercial, but to me those are not important applications.<br /><br />Gaim has some nice features. But in general I like AIM. What I don't like about AIM is what I really like about Gaim. AIM has too much garbage (typical AOL/Microsoft problem). Gaim does what you want. Simple, though I would change a few things if I could. I use Gaim in both Linux and Windows jut to keep some consistency.<br /><br />I would be interested in knowing what applications are &quot;mission critical&quot; for the membership here. Which ones have you not found a replacement, or not found one that meets your standards. Particularly those that are keeping you in Windows and not allowing you to go full time into Linux. And why? Oh, and do you even care about using Linux 100%<br /><br />Mine are:<br />1. Quicken. The last time I checked into doing this in WINE you could not get all the features of the newer versions.<br />2. Access-like database program. I have used Lotus Approach for 8 years to keep up with my database. The version I have is 3 or 4 years old, but it works. I am not a programmer and furthermore do not see the need to become one to make a nice PHP/MySQL/Apache solution work for me.<br />3. Winmodem support (I <b>hate</b> notebooks). The modem on my notebook is the reason I do not use Linux on the road.<br /><br />Other than those three, and the ubiquitous game argument, I could go 100% Linux right now. I could even change my style of gaming to take care of that. I have a Playstation after all. Isn't that what it was made for?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">On the topic of the Gimp's UI, a lot of people are getting serious work done with it. &nbsp;There is a version of the Gimp which is made for editing film instead of single images (although the UI is identical), called CinePaint aka FilmGIMP. &nbsp;According to the website....<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote"><br />It is the most popular open source tool in the motion picture industry -- used in 2 Fast 2 Furious, Scooby-Doo, Harry Potter, Stuart Little and other feature films. CinePaint is used for painting of background mattes and for frame-by-frame retouching of movies. It is being extended to do film restoration. <br /><br />...<br /><br />Some projects it's used on and who's using it:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp;Rhythm &amp; Hues: Harry Potter, Cats &amp; Dogs, Dr. Dolittle 2, Little Nicky, Grinch, Sixth Day, Stuart Little, and Planet of the Apes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Sony Pictures Imageworks: Stuart Little II<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Hammerhead: Showtime, Blue Crush and 2 Fast, 2 Furious<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Flash Film Works: Duplex, The Last Samurai<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Computer Cafe: League of Extraordinary Gentlemen<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Amalgamated Pixels: Elf, Looney Tunes <br /></div><br /><br /><br /><br />http://linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6148<br /><br />http://cinepaint.sourceforge.net/<br /><br />(http://cinepaint.sourceforge.net/pix/linux/cinepaint.0.18.cineon.suse.512x384.jpg)<br /><br />I thought it was kinda neat, amatuer film students have access to the same techonlogy as some of the biggest names in the business.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That is impressive! Big companies are what makes project managers get on the ball and develope well. <br /><br />I still don't like The GIMP's UI. Given a choice of using The GIMP in Linux or a free copy of Photoshop, and be stuck in Windows, I think I would have to opt for the Photoshop. Though I actually have not used it in a couple of years, the UI is at least something I can figure out. I am coming to all of this from a CorelDraw/PhotoPaint background. If you can figure out a Corel products awful interface, you should be able to handle anything.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">in response to the question about whats keeping me in windoze and if going 100% is important<br /><br />to me, the only thing somewhat keeping my dual boot windoze 2000 installed is battlefield 1942 / desert combat which i rarely even play and since the last time i whiped my drives when i did a motherboard swap, i havent even bothered with reinstall battlefield yet.....i've read that winex3.1 and up suppose to play battlefield 1942 well but i havent really bothered....everything else i can get done better and faster in linux...and to me going 100% linux is actually important.... one reason is because it's less fat32 partitions wasting my harddrives capacity...another reason is because I hate the windoze UI personally....and my last reason is because I prefer a stable and secure environment for getting any work done in and for keeping any of my important data...also i get much better gaming performance outta slackware with 2.6 kernel than windoze could ever hope or dream for lol<br /><br />right now im probaly 99.9999% linux for my main system, servers, and router...servers and router is nothing but linux of course lol<br /><br />cinepaint does look pretty impressive also, I forgot where I read it...i think on cnet tech news but I read about disney was doing all of their animation development now on linux machines<br /><br /><br />p.s. if u notice lots of errors in my typing lol dont worry, on laptop and the stupid small keyboard is really gettin on my nerves lol</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Why have I moved more toward Windows for the desktop? I started thinking about that the other day. I have had no problems with my Windows XP desktop. I remember XP prior to service pack 1 and thought it was terrible. Since then, it's actually grown on me. I got used to where things moved to and I found there was a lot more I could adjust to my liking than there was in 2000. Believe it or not, it's stable! The system I have running it is a beast, but I get things done and I don't have to worry about messing with it or poorly written beta software.<br /><br />As for my software, I am using a mix of Firebird and IE 6.0. I use Firebird for the tabbed browsing. I use IE when Firebird won't render a page correctly. Blame the page author for not making a standards based page, but regardless, I have to look at those pages from time to time to get my job done.<br /><br />For my office solution, I use Office XP. Let's face it, OOo is slow and god is it a resource hog. I refuse to use it because it just doesn't get the job done like Office. I've got Office 2003 on my laptop and I like it even more than Office XP. The features are mostly the same, but there are little differences that make it awesome, most notably the improvement of Outlook. I use Outlook every single day for about 50% of my job. <br /><br />We use Exchange for our mail servers and for as large a scale system as the AF has, Exchange works very well. Yes, we have services fail, but there isn't as much administrative overhead for maintaining the Address Directory for the ENTIRE AIR FORCE as would be required for a system based on LDAP or something similar. Administration of Exchange is pretty nice in fact and I have yet to find a product that does the complete job Exchange does. I would like to see the product by SuSE, but I'm not going out of my way for it.<br /><br />Now, where do I use linux and why? I can't think of a better use of linux as a web or database server, a pure email server (not groupware like Exchange), a simple file server (not functioning in a Windows domain...more later), or ftp server. And who can deny dedicated game servers. I use my linux machines for programming (now) and I do occasionally like to use the cheap alternative software to mainstream products that would cost me extra...as long as they don't give me too much headache.<br /><br />Why don't I like Samba in a Windows domain? Right now, we are trying to get a Samba server setup in our NT domain. What we are trying to do is extremely easy on a Windows machine; control who has rights for reading and writing to the share. Samba 3.0 is supposed to work with the Windows management tools for shares. You know what? They don't. The server will barely acknowledge our configurations in the smb.conf. Now I use Samba at home to share files between my linux boxes and my windows box, but here, it sucks. I would hate having to use it as a Domain Controller here considering how many users we have. It may be faster, but not from an administrative standpoint.<br /><br />Why do I like the solutions I do? Because once they are setup, they run. I don't have to mess with them. Initial work is at least twice as much, but in the long run they save me time, but those are servers. As a user, where I have to interact with the environment, I spend more time making things work, usually work like they would in a Windows environment, than I do getting done what it is I'm trying to get done.<br /><br />That leads into another huge point, most Linux software is just doing something that someone else has already done! How many open source projects are there that are unique? How many times do you see someone writing another solution to a problem that's been solved five times before? If you don't believe me, go to Freshmeat (http://freshmeat.net) and look around for a while. Also, there is this geek bandwagon that any time you write something, it needs to be opensource and needs a project behind it. Brave souls, they may be for putting their crappy code for everyone to make fun of, but sort of wasting their own time if you ask me. Shouldn't there be more to life than getting included in a Red Hat release along with four other products that do the same thing?<br /><br />I also want to address the misconception that linux is magically more secure than Windows. Yes, Windows does have a large number of exploits out there, but have you seen how many exploits there are for BIND or WU-FTPD? Almost every system has some remote exploit of one kind or another. The only way to truely make a system secure is to disconnect it. A good administrator will keep up with his patches and updates, thus avoiding vulnerabilities. Most worms come out months after a vulnerability is found. How many root exploits do you know of for Windows and how many are there for Linux? I know of a lot more for Linux server software and even more for local exploits. I believe the whole misconception comes from the fact that fewer people target linux and there are fewer people running linux than there are windows users and windows targetted exploits. As more people start using linux and don't keep up with their updates, their systems will too become hosts for the latest DDoS or worm.<br /><br />This may seem like a huge anti-linux rant, but it's not. I'm just getting fed up with the state that most Free/Open Source software is in and a lot of the zealot mentality of some of our fellow users. I've had to look at software solutions from a point of view that I need something that works and works reliably and Linux just doesn't fit that bill as often for the tasks I need to get done. Sorry guys. I still love to use it for what I love to use it for and it is fun. I hope that some day I can be a Unix administrator because I have more fun doing it, but there are just some things done better in Windows.<br /><br />By the way, it's W-I-N-D-O-W-S. It sounds rather ignorant to call it Winblows as well as elitist. Regardless, Windows has a place just as every other OS. It really doesn't make you look smarter or more l33t by calling it Winblows. It only scares off people who might think of trying Linux out for the first time.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote"><br />That leads into another huge point, most Linux software is just doing something that someone else has already done! How many open source projects are there that are unique? How many times do you see someone writing another solution to a problem that's been solved five times before? If you don't believe me, go to Freshmeat and look around for a while. Also, there is this geek bandwagon that any time you write something, it needs to be opensource and needs a project behind it.

Isn't that what the open source model is all about. We can build on one another's project and make it better. Resubmit it and see it become the best out there. But that is not the way it works in practise. <br /><br />The Linux core itself is a wonderful example of how the OSS model can and should work. But I think that is as far as it goes. (OK, there are a couple of others: OO.o, Gaim, Firebird/Mozilla project, etc.).<br /><br />If more time was spent on making the programs useable, instead of trying to reinvent the wheel each time someone wanted to build a program, we would be in better shap in the OSS world.<br /><br />(I just realize that OSS is better than saying OS. Aren't you proud of me? I am actually thinking this morning).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well wine has come a long way. &nbsp;It can run most windows apps flawlessly, and winex runs most games at or near native speed. &nbsp;So (unless you have some special case apps) you could probably get by, running the same software, on either. &nbsp;So the choice of running windows / linux is less about which apps and games are available, and more about which OS you feel more comfortable in. &nbsp;After using 100% linux for a while now I have a hard time working in Windows, things just don't work the way I'm used to. &nbsp;Not saying anything bad about windows, XP is stable if you have good hardware and a decent machine. &nbsp;For me, device support is a little better in Linux, I've got a windows-only printer and USB camera that only work in windows before XP (or maybe even 2k) but do work fine in Linux. &nbsp;<br /><br />After playing with Gimp and Photoshop a little today, the interfaces seem nearly the same? &nbsp;The only problem I have with both is I like my programs to use MDI (I think that's the term), where the toolbars and open-file windows and everything are contained within a window, photoshop and gimp just let you drag the toolbars around the screen wherever you want. &nbsp;But that's the way the Apple style guru's say that everything should be made...<br /><br />Here are some apps running fine in Linux Slackware 9.1 + Dropline Gnome 2.4.1. &nbsp;Click for full-size...<br /><br />(http://homeweb.org/~imnes/linux/slackware/screens/wine-4-apps-small.png) (http://homeweb.org/~imnes/linux/slackware/screens/wine-4-apps.png)<br /><br />IE 6, Adobe Photoshop 7, Dreamweaver MX, Red Faction 1.2<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Please understand that I am not talking about apps that comparable in linux. I am talking about apps that do not exist in Linux. There are two programs that I live off of. The first is my DJ software there is no mobile DJ software designed for linux. Second is I trade stocks and the software that I use nor any others that I know of is made for linux. Not having these apps is a huge deterent. Until they are made and after extensive testing would I consider changing.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This has been the best discussion I have seen since I joined the club. My reasons for using linux has been very well explained and some of the reasons I wasn't even aware of. My main reason for using linux is pure and simple &quot;cost&quot;. Single machine license on WindowsXP OS and Office are completely out of reach for me &nbsp;to install on my three computers, on my limited retirement pay. I envy those of you that own both XP and Linux and have the choice to choose what apps you want. My computer needs are limited and most of what I do need, I have been able to find in Linux. In rare cases I do need to revert to WindowsME for &nbsp;tax preperation and some other minor functions and even these I hope to use in Linux when I learn how to use WINE.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Keep the discussion going, I love it<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Harold</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">its not an issue of principle..... i use linux because it's practical to me<br /><br />when I used redhat for a while I had to kill xwindows once maybe every 2-3 weeks in certain cases where a program wants to hose xwindows....well now that I've gotten away from redhat and got as far away from rpm based distros as possible, i find slackware to be what I'm looking for...also have only had to kill xwindows once in all the expirementing and testing i've done in slack since I chose it for my primary distro and that was at the fault of a peice of software on sourceforge that was in an alpha state and i expected that a freakout might happen.....another thing, I like how responsive slack9.1 is running 2.6.0 kernel and dropline gnome compared to w2k and xp. another thing is slackware comes with a lot of everyday programs that I use and the ones that arent there already install faster and don't prompt me asking me to reboot after every time I install something...another thing is I've came to like open source versions of the programs I used to use a long while back in windows. originally I used musicmatch jukebox for mp3s, icq200x, and aim long long long ago, cuteftp for ftp, TS(before ts2 days), edonkey, and mozilla for web/mail along with the rest of my stuff<br /><br />now I use xmms for music, licq for icq, gaim for aim/yahoo, ts2, gftp, mozilla still for web and mail, edonkey still, gtk-gnutella, and so on.....even in windows though I still generally found certain open source programs of more use like 7-zip compared to winzip/winrar/winace/etc..... my reason for using open source software and software in linux in general because I get more done, don't have to deal with a lot of the windows annoyances, I don't have to purchase or register for cdkeys/licenses to use the software, and in general for a lot of software I find more features in the OSS solution over any closed source/prop versions<br /><br />there are certain cases where I like both the open source and closed source versions of a certain peice of software(like gimp vs. photoshop) but theres a few parts of the gimp that shine over ps...but then if you look and you will see wine and crossoveroffice....giving you the opportunity to use both at the same time without having to choose one or another but using each for where they shine<br /><br />i don't use linux for the principal of just saying i hate M$ or anything like that....I use linux because it's what I like for an OS, also it gets the job done and offers me more over anything coming out of the windows world<br /><br />another thing I'm happy about running linux is all around I see everyday used software that is loaded with spyware/scumware requiring yet another program to assist in the cleaning....and also ads in the closed source software seems to be the going factor for free software.....icq and aim are 2 big ones loaded with annoying ads and crap.... Licq and gaim dont have those ads and the scumware...and have much more features than trillian pro, icq pro, and aim combined..... so why would I make a stupid mistake and switch from licq and gaim and downgrade to icq and trillain or aim if i was despirate enough to see ads LOL<br /><br />also, its fairly amusing that if you install adaware/adaware pro on a &quot;clean&quot; install of w2k or xp, there will be between 1-5(depending on version of adaware release and os) results of spyware consisting of datacatchers and such related to IE and windows media player.....now why would I want to use an os that right after install i need to protect it and clean it of spyware? &nbsp;lol dont think it deserves to even be called a clean install....theres certain small os annoyances I can overlook, but I can definetely do without little suprises after install lol</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I guess we have had differing experiences with linux on the desktop. My experience especially with Slack9.1 was bad (prior post here (http://www.pcolalug.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=4780#4780)).. So bad, in fact, it drove me back to Win2k. Since I got out here, I tried XP and found it doesn't suck quite like I thought it did. There are some issues with finding stuff, but that is just part of using an OS or program that has been geared toward every day users. When I get back, I will be building a new system and maybe I'll try Gentoo on it. Who knows. I'm not going to rule out anything before I try it. Thank god for choice.<br /><br />So, we all have opinions, much like other things, and some might be smellier than others. I'm glad we can have these discussions. By the way, I'm not conceeding to lloydr. I'm just getting a little bored with it, because it's obvious that we aren't going to meet in the middle on this, nor do either of us want to.<br /><br />Here's to you lloydr... <br /><br />edit-- sorry, since the arguing picture raised some offense from the fellow users, I have taken it off. I am merely trying to make light of the fact that me and lloydr are trying to convince each other of things that we won't agree on. It was meant as a joke, not an insult to anyone. Also, I wasn't trying to enter a pissing contest. I was trying to pull a decent argument out of lloydr that would back up his position that he uses linux because of practicality rather than principle. Not saying that principle is wrong, but he kept making sound like it was for practicality and I saw no argument backing this up. OH WELL. So much for my omedy career. Didn't know I had to be so PC.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ruggy, That is one of the funniest things I have seen.<br /><br />I have had to do some work in Windows the last few days (basically been Windows free for a month and a half). I was installing a little software. Before I could install one, I had to get another up and running. I ended up having to restart 3 times. That is one of the things I absolutely hate about Windows. When I moved to Windows 2000, I found I did not have to restart as often as previous versions. But still not like Linux. In Linux if I have to do anything it is just restart the Windows manager.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think my final test in the practicality/principle question is this:<br /><br />What does your desktop environment look like? Is there a K button or Gnome foot that acts a whole lot like a Start menu? Is your time on a taskbar that sits over in a corner? Do you have a panel that shows open windows? Hmm...sounds like the taskbar from Win9x.<br /><br />Maybe something along the lines of this (http://www.kde-look.org/content/preview.php?file=9714-1.png)...<br /><br />Or do you have a panel with large icons that start commonly used programs with a top menu panel that has several menus to less commonly used programs and functions? Are the icons to minimize, maximize and close your windows round and different colors...sort of like bubbles?<br /><br />Maybe something like this (http://www.kde-look.org/content/preview.php?file=5609-1.png)...<br /><br />Okay, those are so obviously modelled after two different GUIs available in commercial products. So, principle or practicality. By the way, I use linux on the desktop at home for principle sometimes. See, it's not a negative answer, but I usually spend a lot of time making my UI work the most efficiently I can for me...making it more practical.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just caught this thread and thought I'd throw in my two cents.<br /><br />I use both, Linux and Windows. I don't prefer either one as they both have draw backs. I first got into Linux because I was bored with Windows and wanted to try &quot;something new&quot;. I bought my first computer, back in 1985, &nbsp;with the primary purpose of learning about computers. My purpose hasn't changed. I used MS/PC-DOS through the Windows 3.11 era. I used Windows exclusively until 1995 when I started playing with SuSE. I started getting into Linux because it was different and I wanted to learn about it.<br /><br />Now I use Linux on one of my home machines primarily as my internet desktop, Office Apps, and Money Management. I use another Linux machine at home for my router and firewall.<br /><br />I use a Windows machine at home for most mutli-media application. (Eexcept I watch AVI and MPG files on Linux and use Gimp on Linux) I use my Windows computer with a program called showstopper. ShowStopper integrates my TV vieweing, TV Guide, TIVO like activity, and other multimidea activities into one, easy to use, easy to manage, easy to setup, interface. I also use my Windows system for capturing video from my VCR and Digital Camcorder, authoring it and making DVDs. Finally, I use my Windows system to play SimCity 4 (My current addiction)<br /><br />There are some things I find easier to do and more polished in Windows. Other things I find easier to do and more polished in Linux. The bottom line is they are both running on the same hardware so should basically be able to accomplish the same things with the right application. The question comes down to which application do you prefer, the linux App or it's Windows counterpart? Think of it as choosing Gimp or another graphics program in Linux or a similar program in Windows. Which program do you like? Since all of this runs on the hardware, it's just a matter of choice.<br /><br />Choice is good.... (Windows? Linux? Gimp? Photoshop?) It's all up to you.....<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think it comes down to what a person is used to and most comfortable using. &nbsp;Just look at window managers, most of you guys are using Mandrake + KDE even though Slackware + Gnome is <i>obviously</i> the superior platform ;) <br /><br />Okay don't kick me out I was just joking... &nbsp;I use Gnome because it's what I've been using for years and it's where things make sense to me. &nbsp;I was using gnome when it was the buggier, slower, fatter of the two. &nbsp;Now it's the smaller quicker of the two but nobody's moving from KDE to Gnome. &nbsp;<br /><br />Anybody here using some more obscure combo? &nbsp;I actually like FreeBSD the best but I gotta have my WineX games and it's only Linux right now. &nbsp;Anybody using fluxbox or afterstep or anything?<br /><br />I like the version 4 of Xfce...<br /><br />The one missing app from the Gnome platform currently is a good cd-burning program. &nbsp;We have the built-in burning with the file manager that's on-par with what you get out of the box with a mac or win-xp but I mean a full-on cd-mastering program. &nbsp;Dropline is working on one called Optimystic. &nbsp;It's in-line with the Gnome desktop's goal of more minimal streamlined programs. &nbsp;I don't know if it's functional yet but there's a page up for it. &nbsp;http://www.dropline.net/optimystic/<br /><br />(http://www.dropline.net/optimystic/optical/optimystic2.png)<br /><br />Sorry if something doesn't make sense. &nbsp;I just concluded a 7+ hour game of Risk, down to me and one other player, we called a draw. &nbsp;2:30am time for bed.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Im running dropline gnome but KDE, fluxbox, blackbox, etc are all installed(just did full 2gb install of slack9.1)....so for cd burning i used to just use cdrecord command or back while back used to use gnome toaster but now i just went and put k3b on my slack system and made me a launcher for the k3b command and now I got a working k3b in gnome lol <br /><br />only problem was at first it told me a few things didnt support atapi and i needed to use scsi emulation...but i guess it was saying that about reading cds or something because it seems to burn cds justtt fine LOL<br /><br />oh well, works for me....k3b while still keeping my gnome environment &nbsp;:D<br />only thing i do seriously need to do is go and change my kde theme to something a little less fugly cuz this bright shiny gold and silver crap is getting on my nerves hehe</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I also use K3b for CD burning, in the Gnome environment. &nbsp;In fact, I think K3b is about the only KDE application I like...<br /><br />I dual boot my main machine between Mandrake+Gnome and Slackware+Gnome. &nbsp;Still torn on which one I like better... :lol:<br /><br />Dan</div>
