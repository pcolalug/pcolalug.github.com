					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I disagree with Sun's criticism of the GNU license. Sun's main compaint is that no one can profit off using GPL code as a base to create non-GPL code. I would not like it if I wrote code for free under GPL, then had someone use my code with minor modifications to make money. Hooray GPL!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The whole point of the GPL is to keep derivative work open. If people wanted others to be able to take their works and use it in a closed source product, then they would release it under the BSD license. The GPL is a very popular license and just because Sun doesn't like it because it doesn't fit into it's commercial nature, tough. They have enough money to pay people to write &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;code for them. They don't need to be stealing it from the volunteer work of others if those volunteer coders don't want to have their work going into something that will make Sun, or any other company for that matter, money and not see any sort of monetary return.</div>
