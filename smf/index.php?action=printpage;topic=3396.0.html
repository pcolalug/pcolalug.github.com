					Post by: <b>mfreeman73</b> on <b>September 08, 2008, 02:36:17 pm</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have an ubuntu server in my house to share files and I have samba setup on the server with security set to &quot;share.&quot; I can access the share folder fine in windows, but I&#039;d like to access it from my linux desktop (using Ubuntu 8.04).<br /><br />I did this command to mount:<br />sudo mount -t smbfs //192.168.1.101/share /mnt/share<br /><br />When I browse to the /mnt/share folder I can see my files, although their icons have an &quot;X&quot; on them. When I go to open one of them I get the error message: &quot;Access to /mnt/share/file was denied.&quot;<br /><br />Any reason for this? My shares don&#039;t have passwords on them and I don&#039;t have the security level on samba set to user security, but rather share. Anyone have any ideas?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I figured it out. Had to add &quot;nounix&quot; to the options. Not sure why and I only found one website that had that solution, but it worked.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am glad you found the answer! I have actually just installed ubuntu to a new HP desktop for a client and I got to say I am impressed with it.<br />For a simple user friendly distro this is it. I have added the DVD to my bag of tricks now for other clients that I would have pushed Centos or Slackware.<br />And I may have to steal your answer for him.</div>
