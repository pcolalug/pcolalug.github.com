					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Howdy,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Last night Narsil and I tried out something new, called TeamSpeak. &nbsp;It's a voice-over-IP client which lets you talk with other players in online games. &nbsp;I used it last night in Windows, and have now also gotten it to work in Linux. &nbsp;This allows you to coordinate movements/tactics with your teammates, and really adds a lot to the gaming experience. &nbsp;No noticeable impact on game playability, very small bandwidth usage.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I'll tell ya, if you could get a few decent players working together on a team with this voice chat going, I think you'd be unbeatable. &nbsp;It's very easy to set up and use. &nbsp;All you need is headphones/microphone. &nbsp;I did have some issues with my soundcard in Linux, but have solved that. &nbsp;If you'd like to check it out, it's available at: &nbsp;http://www.teamspeak.org and has both Win / Linux versions. &nbsp;Great stuff!<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Will do. &nbsp;I know that Narsil won't be able to play this coming Thursday, and I'll be out of town, but sometime we should try it out. &nbsp;Narsil was also running a Linux TeamSpeak server that we used, although there are plenty of others out there. &nbsp;Looking forward to trying this out with several people at once...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yup, as Dan said, this stuff is really great.<br /><br />I am moving this week, but will be ready for action again after the 21st.<br /><br />I ran the teamspeak server and my ET server at the same time on the linux machine, and played ET on my Windows machine. &nbsp;Saw NO degredation in speed, etc.<br /><br />The Teamspeak server is called &quot;Narsil-et-l&quot; &nbsp;That last letter is a lower case &quot;L&quot;. &nbsp;It will be down till after I move, but after that we can use it while doing the Thursday fight-night drill.<br /><br />Narsil</div>
