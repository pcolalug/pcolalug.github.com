					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m looking at building my next system. If you don&#039;t mind, take a look at my wishlist (https://secure.newegg.com/NewVersion/Wishlist/PublicWishDetail.asp?WishListNumber=6441812&amp;WishListTitle=New+Hardware) at Newegg.<br /><br />I&#039;m mostly wondering if the 750W powersupply is going to be sufficient. Also, since I&#039;m planning on using this for general purpose dev work, running multiple virtual machines, AND gaming, should I go with a higher clocked per-core Core2Duo or does the Core2Quad I have picked make sense? I know the thing is a beast, but I have put a lot of thought into all of the stuff I&#039;ve picked out. I want to make sure I&#039;m making the best choices considering this is such a large investment.<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I got impatient and ordered the parts. Here&#039;s a high level rundown of what I got.<br /><br />Intel Core2Quad E6700 2.66 Ghz<br />eVGA Nvidia nForce 680i SLI Motherboard<br />8 GiB DDR2 800 Memory<br />(2) XFX Geforce 8800GTS 320MB Video Cards to be run in SLI mode<br />(2) Samsung 20&quot; Widescreen 2ms Displays<br />(4) 160GB WD Caviar RE Hard Drives<br />3ware 9650SE-4LPML 4-port PCIe SATAII RAID controller w/ Battery Backup Unit<br />Silverstone 850W Power Supply<br />Lian Li PC-V1200Bplus II Black Aluminum Case (http://www.lian-li.com/product/product06.php?pr_index=8&amp;cl_index=1&amp;sc_index=1&amp;ss_index=2&amp;type=a)<br />...and a lot of other odds and ends...<br /><br />I expect to get everything in on Friday provided Newegg gets is shipped out by this afternoon (it&#039;s after midnight making it officially Tuesday). I&#039;m going to be very annoying to be around for the next four days. Online tracking is a wonderful thing, but a curse when it comes to orders like this. If only the shipping for 2nd day weren&#039;t $350!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">My suggestion for your next system is that you retire your old one my direction. I can even make it a tax deductible gift in time for the new tax year. :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ah, but I have other plans. I&#039;m having a shuffle of sorts. My current system is going to my wife. Her current system, an Sempron AM2 3000+, is becoming the new server. The current server, some may remember my little Shuttle box, is going to a less-fortunate family that can really use it. It will basically mean that the single mom of three will be able to do two of her four jobs from home. I&#039;ve got to get some positive karma points to offset my deficit. &gt;:D While I could use a few tax deductions this year, I will feel better about myself helping her and her kids out.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I guess she probably needs it more than me.<br /><br />I think we are all familiar with the &quot;hand me down&quot; shuffle.<br /><br />It is amazing to me when I hear of someone getting rid of a computer. It is like they never think that it can be used by someone else. I have one sitting across town waiting for me to pick it up. The guy was just going to throw it out, but was concerned about the hard drive contents. I told him I could assure him it was cleaned and I would take the box off his hands.<br /><br />He says it is an old junker. I suspect it is probably a 1.5-2 Ghz machine. A nice junker for me.<br /><br />Just remember, I am always here to catch what you might be throwing out.</div>
