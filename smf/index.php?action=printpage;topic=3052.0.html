					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey guys here is the jest.<br />1. Openbsd box running openntp listening on inside ip 10.0.0.1 it is keeping good time and date.<br />2. slack 10.2 box running ntpd but can not get the proper time to set according to openbsd box.<br />added following script to slackware /etc/rc.d/rc/local<br /># start the NTP daemon:<br />if [ -x /usr/sbin/ntpd ]; then<br />&nbsp; echo &quot;Starting NTP daemon&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;/usr/sbin/ntpd<br />fi<br />then run --# /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2 restart<br />this is what I get.<br />Starting Internet super-server daemon:&nbsp; /usr/sbin/inetd<br />Starting OpenSSH SSH daemon:&nbsp; /usr/sbin/sshd<br />no ntp start.<br />also my date time is all messed up on this machine would like it to poll the <br />Openbsd box for date time.<br /><br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Looking at your post there, it seems to me that if you wanted to start a service you put in rc.local, you&#039;d run that script, not rc.inet2.<br /><br />:X<br />Ian</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yup.&nbsp; The rc.local script is called from rc.M, which is normally only run at boot-up time.&nbsp; The rc.inet2 script doesn&#039;t have anything to do with rc.local.<br /><br />You could just run rc.local manually, or reboot, and the ntp stuff should start and work.<br /><br />Dan<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">According to website for slackware you put that script in /etc/rc.d/rc.local and when you run /etc/rc.d/inet2 restart that calls rc.d/rc.local could be wrong ...reboot did not work.<br />will try running rc.d/rc.local<br />&nbsp; ok here is what I did removed script from /rc.d/rc.local and put it at end of /rc.d/rc.inet2<br />then run /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2 restart<br />got the following<br />Starting Internet super-server daemon:&nbsp; /usr/sbin/inetd<br />Starting OpenSSH SSH daemon:&nbsp; /usr/sbin/sshd<br />Starting NTP daemon: /usr/sbin/ntpd<br />seems good till I run date command<br />Sat Nov&nbsp; 4 04:55:43 UTC 2006<br />at 10:30 friday evening<br />also this is what I get if I manually update with nptdate <br />root@home:/etc/ntp# ntpdate 10.0.0.1<br />Looking for host 10.0.0.1 and service ntp<br />host found : firewall.open-sourceenterprises.lan<br />&nbsp;4 Nov 04:59:56 ntpdate[3400]: adjust time server 10.0.0.1 offset -0.460495 sec<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">yes the slack box is running utc . How do I change that?<br />I have removed ntpd from slack box and installed openntpd instead just to keep things the same.<br />I was able to set the date with the date command but would be nice if I get this working automatically.<br />Thanks for all your help <br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">One thing you might want to do, is to start ntpd with the -g flag.&nbsp; That will have the effect of making it set the time no matter what, when ntpd first starts.&nbsp; If you leave that option out, and the hardware clock is out more than 1000s from the ntp server, it&#039;ll just bomb ntpd and not change anything.<br /><br />Now, to change the timezone on your Slackware machine, pop on up to root, and run timeconfig.&nbsp; (It&#039;s /usr/sbin/timeconfig, btw.)<br /><br />Ian</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">K thanks to all the guys that helped me on this.<br />This is what I have now..........<br />Removed openntp went back with ntp from slackware packages.<br />put following script in /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2 on slack box<br /># Start Ntpd daemon<br />&nbsp; if [ -x /usr/sbin/ntpd ]; then<br />&nbsp; echo &quot;Syncing time with local NTP server&quot;<br />&nbsp; echo &quot;Starting Ntpd daemon: /usr/sbin/ntpd&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/usr/sbin/ntpdate 10.0.0.1 ; /usr/sbin/ntpd<br />fi<br />&nbsp;<br />This may not be the best way or the easiest but after countless hours on this taking a little from each of your<br />comments and tons of material on line. This works best for me.<br />Later I will probally add some code if local not availble to fall back to us.pool.ntp.org<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Glad you got it working...<br /><br />One question that I always think of when this subject is discussed is:&nbsp; What is the need to run ntp/ntpd, anyway?&nbsp; At least for nearly all home users, what does it matter if the system clock is a few seconds different from the &quot;real&quot; time?&nbsp; It seems to me that running yet another daemon for time checking is just a waste of resources, and a potential security hole.&nbsp; Any *good* reasons for running this?<br /><br />Dan<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">When dealing with security you want all your system clocks to be synced the to the same source.<br />For various reasons. Aslo in this case my slackbox was off by more than a day!<br />Also your system bios clock can get skewed by several things including power surges, a weak cmos battery and the likes.<br />So I thought it prudent to have all set to the firewall which is also a ntp server local only and the server it updates from is secure<br />and all my remote machines also sync to this one ntp server. Remember I have a business need precise time on logs.<br />But you are right on most home machines local system time is fine.<br />Atlast there is a chance of an ntp exploit but that is what I do and the only box affected would be the firewall since all other machines pull from it.<br />And I keep a close eye on the exploit list sites atleast 3 times a day.<br /><br />Hope that helps with out being do cryptic. &gt;:D</div>
