					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi guys,<br /><br />About a year ago I set out to build me a near top of the line computer. &nbsp;I ordered my parts from the internet, and because of a freak short in the motherboard I spent the last year rma'ing parts to troubleshoot exactly what got fried in the great summer short.<br /><br />I basically had to rma everything in but the processor, dvd, and ram. &nbsp;I'm still having stability issues with (supposedly) a 2600+ XP. &nbsp;I think they sent me a 1250mhz instead of the real deal.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm fed up with the rma process. &nbsp;I want to send it in to a good local repair shop, and I'm looking for suggestions.<br /><br />The funny thing is, the processor installed slack just fine. &nbsp;I can't figure out why the win2k install would crash and slack runs relatively trouble free.<br /><br />&nbsp;:? <br />Brent</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Brent, If I read it right you are looking for a trustworthy computer repair shop. I have used SunCoast Computers on Hwy 90 in Milton (on the left before you get to walmart if you are heading east) I bought a barebones kit from them and after I got it put together I installed win98 on it. When I finished what I thought was a clean installation the computer froze up. I had to kill the power and then it would not boot up. I called them and they had me bring it in and checked it out. They found a faulty motherboard and replaced it, put everything back together, made sure it worked and didn't charge me a cent. They also like AMD chips. I recommend them.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">my uncle bought the amd xpos 2000+ system from suncoast that they have up on their sign for like $500 and it ended up costing well over $650-750 in the end because the problems the crap parts had and they wouldn't fix or replace...motherboard, harddrive, and some other issues.....from that experience with working on my uncles system, they are a rip off how i see it since a decent intel rig would have been cheaper than that crap....msi micro-atx board (via chipset) with 1 agp, 3 pci w/ onboard graphics/sound/lan, 20gb harddrive, a $5 case with a unstable psu, 1 msi 32x burner, 256mb ddr pc2100 memory(unknown brand), and the weakest point of all...an amd xpos2000+ processor...didnt even come with a monitor for that price<br /><br />for video, sound, and lan they used the onboard crap and the quality of all 3 were pretty bad....also the usb controller on the board crapped out in less than a week<br /><br />i definetely don't recommend suncoast....if your not looking to just order the parts and put them together yourself and only looking for a computer shop....then i would recommend tech advanced in general, they atleast better than suncoast thats for sure.....but if you wanna order parts without any real hassle, check out http://www.newegg.com never gotten a bad part from them in all the thousands of $ worth of parts i've ordered from them over the past year and half....a friend of mine that after about 2 months, had a harddrive go out that came from them and requesting an RMA and sending it back wasnt a hassle at all and they shipped it back fedex express without charging...the entire time between when they received the old one and when the new one was delivered was about 4-5days counting the weekend</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">New Vision Technologies (http://www.nvtcomputers.com/) seems to be good guys. I have never had anything done there, but I have spent quite a bit of time talking with Tim in there.<br /><br />If you can find their address from the website, you are doing better than me. They are located on Davis just South of Airport. They are on the East side of the road in the first shopping center on that side of the road when you are coming from Airport.<br /><br />Mention you are from the group and you should get a 5% discount. Not much, but it helps.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I hate to see SunCoast get accused of not being a good company on second hand information. My comments were from first hand experience and the charges for what I bought &nbsp;were the same as advertised except for the tax. Sometimes some people cause there own problems and shift the blame elsewhere. End of comments about SunCoast.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: Ed</div><div class="quote">I hate to see SunCoast get accused of not being a good company on second hand information. </div><br /><br />um second hand information? I'm the one who fixed the problems that crap parts caused.... &nbsp;it was more like first hand information since anyone who opened the case up with half a brain could see the shotty quality parts used.... and i spent a few hours inside that case over the course of about a week and half....so i had plenty of time to see the quality of suncoast's work &nbsp;:wink: <br /><br />now that the problematic parts are replaced(which suncoast wouldn't replace themselves), the system is running fine....high temps like any amd chip, but still running fine for most part<br /><br />btw...the price i mentioned compared to what was advertised was because parts had to be replaced due to suncoast not taking care of the warranty</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok, so SunCoast is a wash (YMMV). Seems like most local joints are like that: one good experience for every bad. I would encourage you to talk to the folks at New Visions, though. They are a sponsor and are supporting and selling Linux boxen, from what I understand. Wouldn't hurt. As another alternative, there are quite a few folks in the group that could probably get you up and running for the price of a six pack of $BEVERAGE.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I haven't been there in a while but I used to work at Technologies For Tomorrow on Davis by Books-A-Million. They also sell Linux boxes and, as I remember, have some good techs.<br /><br />Steve</div>
