					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Saw a news report today that Adobe is acquiring Macromedia in a stock trade. &nbsp;Adobe seems to be Linux friendly with their products, do you think this will mean more up-to-date Linux plugins for Flash (and 64-bit support), or maybe even a linux port of Dreamweaver finally?<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Dreamweaver MX 2004 is the only application that ties me to the Windows jail, however I don't think Adobe's acquisition is going to mean anything for the Linux Community. Adobe really has no &quot;ties&quot; to the linux world. Just about every application reads/writes in PDF (whereas the Window world is snowed to believe PDF only means Adobe), and GIMP is the &quot;Photoshop&quot; equivalent. What gains, if any, would Adobe have to port the Macromedia applications to Linux? As much as I'd like to say plenty, history says it wouldn't benefit them at all.</div>
