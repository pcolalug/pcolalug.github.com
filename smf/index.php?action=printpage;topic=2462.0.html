					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">hm, well i forgot to post this along with the Mastering FreeBSD and OpenBSD security book as they were closely related but here it is.<br /><br />O'Reilly<br />Linux Server Security, Second Edition<br />By Michael D. Bauer<br />Second Edition January 2005 <br />ISBN: 0-596-00670-5<br />544 pages, $44.95 US<br />http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/linuxss2/<br /><br />This book goes along with the moving trend of the normal computer user, securing your data. Servers generally are targeted more often than the average home PC because most are made to be accessible from the outside world. This is where securing that server comes into play. This book covers the tools and techniques to securing your Bastion host.<br /><br />First I'd like to start out and explain what Bastion host means as according this book so you can understand what this book covers more specifically. Bastion Host is defined as &quot;A system that runs publicly accessible services but is usually not itself a firewall. Bastion hosts are what we put on DMZ (although they can be put anywhere). The term implies that a certain amount of system hardening has been done, but sadly, this is not always the case.&quot;<br /><br />After you understand what a Bastion host is defined as, you should understand that this book mainly covers these server daemons and the systems that run them. But some of the information applies to a Linux desktop system such as a per host iptables firewall, using secure shell, keeping up with your logs, and intrusion detection. Most of these things the average user doesn't care much about but sometimes being paranoid comes in handy.<br /><br />Someone who would most likely use this book more than the average desktop user would probaly be a system administrator. Securing web, database, ftp, dns, and email servers is what majority of this book contains. Along with covering these server systems, there are guides to securing the Linux system that runs these daemons along with designing the networks around these types of hosts. <br /><br />One of the sections I'm most fond of is Chapter 2: Designing Perimeter Networks. With this section you can really take a look at the design and layout of the different types of networks and figure out the portions that suit your needs for your own network. The diagrams shown in this chapter help explain what is going on with the traffic and allows you to see exactly what is going on and at what points the systems are protected. <br /><br />At the end of the book there are 2 well commented iptables firewall scripted that allow you to get a feel for the netfilter iptables system if you're not familiar with it already. With some modification of these scripts you can easily bring them into a working environment depending on your situation, which sometimes these helps with some of the frustration with the iptables syntax. I personally prefer the PF system within OpenBSD for it's clean syntax and have grown away from iptables, but both are powerful firewall systems and should fit the needs of your network.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this book to system admins or anyone who is paranoid about their security. Security is always something that people should be educated about.<br /><br />Lloyd Randall<br />Pensacola Linux User's Group<br /><br />-------------------<br />Posted at O'Reilly, Amazon, and Barnes&amp;Noble</div>
