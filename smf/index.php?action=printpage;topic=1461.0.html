Guallar-Esteve was laid off from IBM in the summer of 2001, he thought it would take months to find another job in technology. After all, he had seen some of his friends remain unemployed for nearly a year before finding work. <br />But Guallar-Esteve had an edge: He knew Linux.<br />The free open-source software is becoming an increasingly popular alternative to Microsoft's Windows for running large computer networks and desktop PCs. That surging demand is good news for technology workers familiar with Linux.<br /><br />Guallar-Esteve, who taught himself Linux, landed a new job at Raleigh-based Red Hat, the world's largest Linux distributor, in a little over a month. After about a year there, he got a call from another technology company in Greenville, offering him a similar position making more money. He accepted.<br /><br />Big corporations, schools and government agencies are embracing Linux open-source software because it is cheaper, more flexible and considered more reliable. For example, viruses are less of a problem, both because of how the code is written and because Linux is a less popular target for virus writers.<br /><br />Linux now holds about 23 percent of the worldwide market for the operating systems used to run large server computers, compared with Microsoft's 55 percent, according to market researcher IDC.<br /><br />And as institutions switch to computers run by Linux, &quot;they need systems administrators, engineers and technicians to manage those systems,&quot; said Peter Childers, vice president of global learning services at Red Hat.<br /><br />IBM, the world's biggest seller of computers and related services, said last month that it plans to hire 15,000 employees this year, including many Linux programmers. IBM, one of the Triangle's largest corporate employers, hasn't said how many jobs would be added in this area.<br /><br />For some workers, formal training in Linux wasn't required to help land a job.<br /><br />After her previous employer folded, Lisa Lorenzin of Durham was highlighting her experience as a network security engineer and beta tester when she applied for a job with NetScreen, a network security company based in Sunnyvale, Calif.<br /><br /><i><b>On her resume, she listed Linux programming as one of her skills and mentioned that she was a member of a Linux user group. That was enough for NetScreen to offer her the job as senior systems engineer for its North Carolina operations.<br /><br />&quot;My manager has told me that my Linux background was a significant factor in their decision to hire me,&quot; Lorenzin said.</b></i><br /><br />Both Lorenzin and Guallar-Esteve taught themselves the ins and outs of Linux. They set up Linux-based servers in their homes, where they created and maintained Web sites for friends and family members.<br /><br />Guallar-Esteve said he thought it was only a matter of time before companies would realize the benefits to using Linux and start to switch. &quot;I knew I needed to keep my Linux skills sharp,&quot; he said.<br /><br /><i><b>Jay Cuthrell, chief technology officer at NeoNova, a Morrisville Internet service provider for rural telephone companies, said that he generally looks for Linux experience when reviewing potential employees. He did so recently when he hired Jay Almers of Hillsborough as a Web developer for the company.<br /><br />&quot;If we had gotten someone in who just knew Windows, they would not have been hired,&quot; Cuthrell said. &quot;You had to know Linux.&quot;</b></i><br />Cuthrell said his company has used the open-source system since 1995. Early on, Cuthrell said, it was a challenge to find workers with Linux experience, but it has gotten easier.<br /><br />That's because the number of people who are adding Linux experience to their portfolio is increasing.<br /><br /><i><b>Mike Johnson, president of Triangle Linux Users Group, said that he has watched the club grow from a group of about 20 that met in a basement classroom at UNC-Chapel Hill five years ago.<br /><br />Attendance at the group's monthly meetings is now about 65 or 70, and sometimes as high as 90. Johnson said that in the past few years, he has seen a number of Linux hobbyists land good jobs because of their background.</b></i><br /><br />Enrollment in Red Hat's Linux training and certification program, which teaches how to set up and maintain Linux networks, has grown 30 percent for each of the past three years, said Childers, who oversees the program.<br /><br />Since the Red Hat program started in 1999, 10,200 people worldwide have graduated from it, he said. About 97 percent of the students are sent to the program by their employers.<br /><br />Childers said that many of the people with open-source training have gotten jobs in their fields paying more than they were earning in previous technology positions.<br /><br />That was the case for Guallar-Esteve, Lorenzin and Almers.<br /><br />&quot;I am making more now than I did in the telecommunications world at Nortel,&quot; said NeoNova's Almers. &quot;This is good.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Staff writer Vicki Lee Parker can be reached at 829-4898 or vparker@newsobserver.com.</div>
