					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I saw this on /., but it's worth sharing. Engadget put up a posting from their BBS in 1985. Here's the link:<br /><br />http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000430055334/</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Man that is great!! I ain't near as old as ed and sandspur, but I remember those BBS days. What wonderful tech we had going back then. It is quite humurous to read this article. Way too long though. Have to book mark it and get it in chunks.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yeah, that article is awesome. I agree it is too much to read at one time though. I used to run a BBS for some friends and connect to a bunch of them in the area, but never saw one as nice as that. I remember connecting every day to play BRE or Overkill(I think that was the name) and sometimes check some message boards. Mom hated it because I was always tying up the phone line. Learning to install a BBS was the first time I learned what format c: does. I thought it was the command I wanted at the time. DOS and Win3.1 for an IBM PS/2 comes on 12 3.5 inch floppy disks in case you were wondering how that turned out.</div>

Funny thing was I was looking at http://www.fidonet.org just the other day looking to see if they were still around. (FYI, they are still passing fidomail around)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ahhhhh yes, the good 'ole days. &nbsp;I too was a Fidonet BBS sysop (1:115/321 in Chicago), from 1993-1996. &nbsp;MSDOS with PCBoard software, and either Frontdoor or Intermail front-end. &nbsp;This was on a 386SX-25, with either 4Mb or 8Mb of RAM (can't recall which). &nbsp;Had a very complicated batch file to run the whole thing, exiting to doors and utilities, and sending/receiving Fidonet Echomail in the middle of the night (via my USR Courier Dual Standard modem at 28.8Kbps). &nbsp;It was great fun.<br /><br />I will always remember that period of time with great affection. &nbsp;Some of my best computer accomplishments were during that time, including installing Linux for the first time (Slackware) from a bazillion floppies. &nbsp;Actually got it up and running, but didn't stay with it as I didn't really know what to do with it. &nbsp;There wasn't a readily accessible WWW, and no Google, to help out. &nbsp;Anyway, that's a good trip down memory lane.... &nbsp; :lol: <br /><br />Dan</div>
