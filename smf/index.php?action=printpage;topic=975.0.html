					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">My old computer (not really, only about a year old) has died 5 times so far. &nbsp;Having to swap power supplies and motherboards, the HD is acting up now. &nbsp;I'm gonna fix it and give it to a family member and just build myself a new one, too fed up with it.<br /><br />I ordered a G4 quicksilver case off ebay the other day, gonna see if I can modify and stuff standard PC parts into it, build me a fake-intosh with linux / BSD on it. &nbsp;I'll keep you posted on how / if it works out.<br /><br />BTW: Anybody know about the Athlon 64? &nbsp;I hear it should be released Sept 23, but prices will be $400+ for chips, and close to $300+ for motherboards. &nbsp;If that's the case I'll have to stick with a regular 32-bit chip for now. &nbsp;If you have any info please let me know.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Good luck.<br /><br />I strongly advise you buy your parts locally unless the local vendors are outragously expensive.<br /><br />At least that way you can easily return it if your part is bad. &nbsp;I'm currently playing snail mail tag with two companies out in california. &nbsp;I should have had my computer built early july....and well it's nearly september and I'm fed up with all the RMA screwups.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Local prices suck bad, but for the important things I try local. &nbsp;Only problem is nobody local carries what I would consider name brand components. &nbsp;(I have to admit though, all my parts that have been dying have been good brands. &nbsp;Antec PSUs, Gigabyte mother boards). &nbsp;<br /><br />For this project I have to buy local just so I can size-up parts to make sure they physically fit in this case. &nbsp;Unless I go to tech advanced I think my options are chaintech, commate, and pc-chips. :(<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You wouldn't REALLY have to go local. I mean you can usually get detailed specs and measurements for most hardware that you buy. Hole aligment and dimensions and what not.<br /><br />I refuse to buy anything locally unless it's reasonable in price to something online+shipping or if I have to have it right then and there. But if I were building a new computer, Newegg.com would certainly get my business..<br /><br /><br />cheers,<br /><br /><br />Tim</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have purchased or assisted in purchases for 8 computers from ABS. Only two components ever had to be returned and ABS handled it well. ABS has my business and recommendation as long as I am buying a new computer. That said, I have not personally bought a new desktop in 6 years. Everything I have had since then (except for my notebook) has been purchased used, or upgraded machines.<br /><br />But, I don't guess imnes is looking for a new, pre-configured, system. Why do that when you can buy all the parts and build what you want?<br /><br />I remember back in the dark ages that you could build a system for much cheaper than buying one. Now it is just as cheap to buy the system that comes close to what you want and tweak it from there.<br /><br />Good luck, imnes. And if the family does not want to take your old problems, I would be glad to give them a home.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">To build for me is not about price. It was nice when you could save a few dollars, but these days, if I build it's because there's nothing like having a system that you put together.. You trust it, feel good about it.. Or atleast that's me.<br /><br /><br /><br />cheers,<br /><br /><br />Tim</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well I managed to get measurements and specs on over 30 different boards, and nothing after pentium 3 era will work. &nbsp;It was a fun idea though. &nbsp;I'm relisting the case on eBay get to get my money back out of it, and am going to wait a few more weeks for the Athlon64 to debut, I might try to get one of those.<br /><br />In the meantime I'll still be looking for a case. &nbsp;Unlike most people I want a case that has minimal noise (not 5 case fans) and minimal lights. &nbsp;Hey I gotta sleep in the same room with this thing. &nbsp;:)<br /><br />Any suggestions? &nbsp;The apple case was a nice design, single small LED, and one case fan that sat directly over the PCI slots to cool everything.<br /><br />Nick</div>
