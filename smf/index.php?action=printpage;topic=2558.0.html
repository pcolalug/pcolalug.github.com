					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The other day my roomie (patrick) noted that our internet had stopped working. &nbsp;I didn't think that much about it, because mine was still working fine. &nbsp;Anyway, I was fiddling w his laptop (i wrote a shell script to get him connected) and I noticed the wrt54g wasn't responding. &nbsp;<br /><br />I figured, well the wireless is down. &nbsp;We had a power blip the other day, but the wifi was down before that so ... &nbsp;I go back to my room (remember my net connection is still working), and I try to connect to 192.168.1.1 to check and see if the wifi was down. &nbsp;Only thing was, I couldn't connect to the router at all!<br /><br />I pinged it, no response, I nmaped it, no reponse, I nmaped the entire 192.168.1.*. Nothing. &nbsp;I have no clue as to what's going on. &nbsp;I had an admin pw set for the router, fairly strong one, so I can rule out foul play. &nbsp;<br /><br />I've never seen a router do this before. &nbsp;If I had the interface up, I could reinstall the firmware, but I have no interface!<br /><br />Honestly I don't know what to do. &nbsp;The router isn't &nbsp;a brick, but it's like it decided to turn off wifi and and close down it's admin interface on it's own.<br /><br />(I haven't made any changes to it for the last 30 days)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">try punching the tiny little reset button on back, I believe you push and hold it for a certain amount of time to revert to factory defaults.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yup, holding the reset button for 10 seconds will reset to factory defaults, so you should then be able to log in to 192.168.1.1. &nbsp;Leave the username blank, and the factory password is &quot;admin&quot;.<br /><br />If you can't connect to it with a browser, remember that the machine you are using to do that with must also be on the same subnet (192.168.1.x).<br /><br />Dan (who just went through this when flashing his router to the newest firmware...).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok, <br /><br />I got the router reset, but now I can't get my buds lappy back online via wifi.<br /><br />Here's a basic rundown of what i'm doing:<br />ifconfig eth0 down (eth0 is his wifi card for some funky reason)<br />iwconfig essid &quot;blahid&quot; channel 11 mode Managed key xxxxxxxxx<br />ifconfig eth0 168.192.1.101 netmask 255.255.255.0<br />ifconfig eth0 up<br />route add default gw 192.168.1.1 dev eth0<br /><br />can't ping yahoo or the router itself ...even the ip.<br /><br />I get Network Unreachible.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Some things to check:<br />1. &nbsp;Does &quot;ifconfig&quot; show the eth0 interface as up and running, with an IP ?<br />2. &nbsp;Is there a driver/module loaded for the wifi card (&quot;lsmod&quot;)?<br />3. &nbsp;Are you SURE that the channel, essid, and WEP key are the same between what you posted above (the NIC), and what is set in the router? &nbsp;Check for spelling/typos... &nbsp;Then check it again...<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">1. Have you changed the essid on the router from the default Linksys?<br /><br />2. Are you sure you enabled WEP and are you sure you're putting in the correct WEP key?<br /><br />3. Driver/firmware(if required) loaded on his laptop (lsmod and iwconfig to see)<br /><br />4. Ensure iwconfig sees the wireless extensions for the WNIC. (iwconfig)<br /><br />5. Check to see if his laptop sees the AP by running (iwlist eth0 scan).<br /><br />6. Your iwconfig above is incorrect. It should be:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"># iwconfig eth0 essid blahid key xxxxxxxxx</div><br />Also, once you type that in, be sure to commit it with<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"># iwconfig eth0 commit</div><br />I wouldn't set a channel because it should find it and managed should be the default mode.<br /><br />7. Why are you doing ifconfig eth0 down and up? Those aren't necessary.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yeah it was a typo.<br /><br />Anyway, I decided to dissable wep encryption, and use mac filtering since pats lappy will automatically jump on the strongest non-encrypted connection. &nbsp;Lot easier than doing it manualy every boot, and having to fight with the ndis software over who gets control of the wifi card. &nbsp;I just added his MAC address to those allowed on the network.<br /><br />Yeah, I know it's unsecure. &nbsp;I know someone w tcpdump could probobly grab his mac address, knock him off the network, and hijack the connection, but he likes it this way, and it's HIS data flowing unencrypted, not mine.<br /><br />Anyway, now i have &nbsp;a new problem. &nbsp;I flashed the wrt54g w sveasoft (TI) firmware, but now it won't resolve dhcp. &nbsp;Release, renew just gets me a line of zeros. &nbsp;I did power cycle the cable modem so that it would pick up the router. &nbsp;I seem to recall having this same problem with sveasoft before.<br /><br />Brent</div>
