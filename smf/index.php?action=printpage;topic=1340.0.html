					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm fixing to take the plunge and partition my computer for both Windows XP and LINUX. &nbsp;I am evaluating distribution choices and was able to get a copy of Lindows 4.5 Developers Edition for under $20.00. &nbsp;<br /><br />I've heard that Lindows is a good OS for those of us addicted to MS-Windows to cross over to. &nbsp;Any opinions?<br /><br />Thanks :)<br /><br />JG</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've never used Lindows...so no matter how much I want to bash it, I can't say. I hear it is supposed to be setup very much like Windows. You may want to try Mandrake out. Most of the people here use it, so you'll be able to get better support out of it. It's put together very well and balanced for the newbie and the advanced user. It hides enough so that Linux isn't completely overwhelming, but the nitty-gritty is just below the surface, so you don't have to dig far to get to the advanced stuff.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I haven't used Lindows before and really not willing to try it at all.....but from what I've heard about the specs such as it likes to put people in the situation of running as root full time, I think it would be a bad idea as far as a distro....I really wanna bash it but I haven't tried it....just stating one of the bad features I've heard and read about all over the place<br /><br />I'd probaly recommend mandrake or suse, but if your looking for better support in this forum, mandrake is probaly a better bet because theres a greater possibility that someone has had similiar questions that you might ask down the road<br /><br />I personally use slackware but I won't recommend that to a new user, but have tried suse 9 pro out recently and it seems fairly clean cut and geared for the new user, yast and the kde default are the only 2 things I didn't like as far as being a good first distro for someone...mandrake you will probaly find most people recommending though, so might want to consider it &nbsp;:D</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'll tell you that Lindows is a fine choice, based on a co-worker's experience. He's been running it almost exclusively at home for the last 8 months. His teenage daughter and his wife both use it without any hassles and he says that its a pleasure to update and install most packages via the Click-n-Run. From what I've seen, the UI (KDE) is polished and consistant.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with any of the distro's mentioned here, either. Just be aware that Linux desktop usage is really still in its infancy. There are still some things that you may have to put a bit more effort into than you would in Windows XP (think of the old Win 95 days in some cases). Also, the GUI's you have to choose from won't be exactly like the Window's interface, but you should find your way around in no time. Feel free to get some help from our membership if you run into problems.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would go with Mandrake or Redhat both of which have excellent support and ease of install both have nice graphic layout's and are point and click for you old microsoft warhorses.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I can't believe it... I actually agree with rburt3 :!: <br /><br />I would give Lindows a spin. If you are anything like the rest of us, you will probably test drive more than 6 distros before the end of the year. If you have Lindows, give it a try. Then I would recommend that you try some others. Eventually landing on Mandrake. <br /><br />I also recommend that you try Lindows because most of us have never seen it personally. Give us a report on what you think about it. I would agree that it is not the safest distro to run in any kind of secure environment, but you can still enjoy trying it along with all the others.<br /><br />And, if you don't like it and decide to toss it (as long as the license allows) toss it my way. I would be glad to see what it is like. Plus I have a friend whose last name is the same as the distro, I want to see if it is worthy of his name. :D</div>
