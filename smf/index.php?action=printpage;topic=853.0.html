					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">OK. I want spam but can't seem to get any.<br /><br />I'm trying to test out a new spam filtering program at work. I setup an email server with some fake accounts, posted thier addresses on a couple of web sites, posted them in a few newsgroups, and even posted them in a few IRC channels. Still no spam.<br /><br />I don't get it. When I don't want spam I get tons of it. When I do want it I don't get any.<br /><br />Anyone know of some definite sites I can post my address at that will guarantee me to get spammed?<br /><br />Here's the address if you want to help me out: steve@labmx.techsoft.com<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You could try setting up dummy mail accounts on hotmail and yahoo. These seem prime targets for spammers.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Can't you set some sort of forwarding or use something like rugmonster describes in his article (http://www.pcolalug.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=849)?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Gotmail (http://www.nongnu.org/gotmail/) is an option for retrieving mail from a hotmail account. You can probably use this and then put it through your filter.<br /><br />And to get spam, go visit a few pr0n sites and put in your email addresses for free trials.<br /><br />Don't ask me how I know...</div>
