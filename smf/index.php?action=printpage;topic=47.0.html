					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Does anyone, other than me, own any of the Loki games? I know Loki went under a few months ago but they ported some of the best games to Linux. I own Sim City 3000, Civilization: Call to Power, Sid Meyer's Alpha Centauri, Railroad Tycoon II, and Heavy Gear II. <br /><br />The reason I'm asking is that there are still a couple of sites that host the patches and FAQs for Loki games and I was thinking about mirroring them on to CD. Would anyone be internested in copies of this CD? It will only contain patches so don't get your hopes up for a full version of a copyrighted game.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have Call to Power and Railroad Tycoon II. Neither of which I have ever been interested in until recently. I am getting ready to get into Call to Power. I would be interested in a patch CD and information on where to get some of their other games. I got both of mine with purchases of other Linux software.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'll see if I can download all of the Loki Patches and burn them to a CD. I'll bring them to the meeting.</div>
