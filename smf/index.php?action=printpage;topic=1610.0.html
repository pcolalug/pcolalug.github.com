					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've seen linux do some wierd things in my time, but when I compiled 2.6.5 a number of strange things have broken on my pc.<br /><br />For instance, my modem script no longer works because something went funky with insmod, /dev/cdrom no longer exsists, and apparently my pc speaker doesn't work anymore, and of course as always alsa is broken.<br /><br />I will be SOOO glad when slackware - current moves to 2.6.x. &nbsp;Seriously, it's times like this that I want to drop slackware.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Is there any particular reason you need to move to the 2.6.x? &nbsp;What will it give you that 2.4.x is not giving you?<br /><br />I have found that I must provide a solid answer to those kinds of questions (to myself), before bothering with an upgrade.<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">There are some really nice things in 2.6, but many of the things you're used to are gone or changed a bit.<br /><br />First, ALSA is part of the kernel now. There's a nice ALSA guide here (http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/alsa-guide.xml). Its for Gentoo, but if any time it says to emerge something, just install it like you would on your distro instead.<br /><br />devfs (/dev/*) is deprecated and turned off by default in 2.6, so you have to explicitly select support for it when you compile your kernel. I heard a blurb somewhere that devfs won't be in 2.7 at all, so we'll all have to start learning about udev (the new device file system) sooner or later.<br /><br />As for your module loading problems, did you install the new modutils package? 2.6 requires that you do.<br /><br />All that being said, danc is right. Unless 2.6 gives you something you really need, like bluetooth or better USB support, then I wouldn't stress too much about it until your distro &quot;officially&quot; supports it.</div>

I meant that the rumor I heard said that devfs won't be in <b>2.6.7</b>, wich is right around the corner. Those of you using boxed/standard distros will probably not have to worry about that until the end of the year, I'd imagine.<br /><br />Good to hear that you're having success with it, lloydr. The new proc/pci interface stuff is nice. I much prefer lspci over grepping through /proc/ for stuff. I haven't looked into switching from devfs to udev, but Gentoo, once again, has a guide (http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/udev-guide.xml) that I've been meaning to get to...</div>
