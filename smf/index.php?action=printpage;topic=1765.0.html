					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've found some awesome groupware. It's called PHProjekt (http://www.phprojekt.org/). This PHP based software seems to do it all. It has Forums, Calendars, Project management, Time Clocks, Notes, Chat, File uploads and downloads and much more. It's module based and there are a bunch of add-ons for it. It might even be worth looking at to run for the User's Group. I just set it up at home so my Teenage sons can schedule their work hours and we can see who's going to be home and when. Also, good for scheduling access to vehicles in the house... :lol: <br /><br />It took me about 1 to 2 hours to get everything setup.<br />It's included with SuSE but being PHP based can be used with just about any Distro. I'm using MySQL as the backend but it's pretty versatile for SQL servers.<br /><br />Anyway, I think it's pretty cool so had to brag about it.<br /><br />Steve</div>
