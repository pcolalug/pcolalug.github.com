					Title: <b>Different Distros (What's the big deal)</b><br />
					Post by: <b>steve</b> on <b>November 22, 2004, 08:29:03 pm</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">OK, So I just thought about this and figured I'd post it.<br /><br />I was running Mandrake and switched to SuSE on my production desktop. I just finished running RH9 on my test system and am now running Debian. While they all installed differently, once they were up and running, I was presented with the same old KDE or Gnome desktop and the same Apps. So, thinking about it, quickly, it dawned on me why worry about which distro you're running? (Of course this is in reference to the biggies that are stable)<br /><br />So, what I'm looking for is some comments on why choose one major distro over another without talking about setp/installation etc. Remember, as we saw in a recent poll, we spend very little time tweaking and installing/setting up stuff on the system and most of our time using the apps.<br /><br />So, here's my short list of switching from one distro to the other.<br />(LOL, I was going to start point one with prebuilt RPMs, but then that goes against what I just pointed out about installation being of little significance in useing a distro for the long term)<br /><br />1. Hardware support. I switched to SuSE because it supported the AMD64 procssor so the applications run much faster and the system doesn't get bogged down. (Of course I'll be switching to the 32 bit version in 9.2 due to a lack of apps compiled for the AMD64) (I know, see above)<br /><br />2. Keeping up with the lates. I like the distros that release new versions often. This means they support the latest hardware out of the box. ie. USB plug-n-play, SATA raid, etc.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I agree that after installation and setup, for the most part, the distros are all about the same.<br /><br />But, I choose Mandrake for 2 reasons. One is that though I am spending more time working with my system than tweaking, there is the occasional necessary app install or tweak. Mandrake Control Center works well for me (in 10.0 final, I can't say as much for many of the earlier releases).<br /><br />Secondly, and the bigger of the two, is Newton's First Law (the famous Newton, not our forum member). I'm comfortable where I am. I have tried some other distros in different situations and am glad I have not blown away Mandrake. It fits me well and I don't see any compelling reason to change.<br /><br />Programs that are daily use for me get updated as soon as a new version comes out as long as there is not alot of configuration to do. I tend to stay with older versions of things that are a little more time consuming to upgrade. For example, I was using Firefox 0.8 on my main box until 1.0 Final came out. That was due to the pain it was to set up all my extensions again. But I update OpenOffice.org every time a new version hits the servers. Just install and it is ready to take the place of the last version.<br /><br />Therefore, I will probably stay with Mandrake for the lethargic reason of &quot;why move if I don't have to?&quot;</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Most distro's are a little different after installation, and I try to find the one that works best with my hardware and supports the features I like. &nbsp;They all take a different approach to things like automatic drive mounting. &nbsp;They seem to have different methods to detect hardware. &nbsp;They have different sets of applications that are easily available for them. <br /><br />All of the big distributions most people here use have heavily modified kernels, and some kernel mods obviously don't work well with some hardware. &nbsp;<br /><br />I was making a point to run a 64 bit distro on the new box, but I haven't really seen much performance gain in it over a 32 bit. &nbsp;I haven't decided which one to ultimately use full-time yet, but there's definitely less hassle involved in just running 32 bit. &nbsp;<br /><br />My 64 bit solution so far is to run a 64 bit distro, install a 32 bit version of FireFox for the browser, and install Crossover Office for browser plugins. &nbsp;Works for me. &nbsp;Besides browser plugins the problem with 64 bit distro is weird dependency / library issues. &nbsp;A lot of software using InstallShield / ZeroG installer just crap out under a 64 bit system. &nbsp;Game installers won't run without hacking because they don't see x86 / i386 as the platform.<br /><br />I like the idea of the system keeping itself updated, and the best solution so far seems to be a Debian based system. &nbsp;I always have trouble using the auto-update tools in Fedora (I end up having to manually go through and update a few packages at a time until they're all done). <br /><br />I haven't seriously used Mandrake in a couple years, but I might give it a shot. &nbsp;<br /><br />One not-so-important but nice to have feature I look for is matching apps across APIs. &nbsp;I like qt, gtk, java, and other applications to look the same. &nbsp;Most distro's have this figured out, so it's not really a big deal.<br /><br />I don't like distro's modifying the window managers (fedora) to hack out features. &nbsp;Fedora 3 has the menu editing capabilities back in Gnome, but the menu system is read only, so I still can't add applications to it :( &nbsp;That annoys me.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">We've always been told told that Mandrake is the bleeding edge and I, like a lot of people tended to believe it. So, just to satisify my curiosity, and because I have nothing better to do right now, I went to Distro weatch and compared the package versions of SuSE 9.2 and Mandrake 10.1. Here's what I found:<br /><br />Of the packages listed on Distro Watch, Mandrake had 9 packages that were more up to date than the same packages on SuSE. However, SuSE had 15 packages that were more up to date than the same packages on Mandrake. <br /><br />I know this doesn't mean much as you can download and install most of the packages latest versions fairly easily, but it was interesting results. &nbsp;I also know Mandrake 10.1 was released 1 month before SuSE, so that may account for the differences.<br /><br />Steve</div>

I know I can download it for free, but I prefer to buy it. The big thing on the Mandrake club was support. (I know you can get support on the internet just by using Google, but this was a central place to go to and not have to deal with filtering out non-mandrake stuff.) The other thing I used on the club was the downloading of apps. <br /><br />I just didn't like the idea of Mandrake charging for the distro and for their (public) support channel. I can get into the SuSE support page just by being a registered owner of the product.<br /><br />Alas, I probably also switched because, like a lot of us in here, I got bored and wanted to try something different. SuSE looked promising, especially since Novell had just bought them and Ximian. Since I &quot;live&quot; in Evolution, SuSE looked like a better bet.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It's all about freedom of choice, and personal taste. In Slackware, everything is configured at /etc/rc.d. In Fedora, the same config files are located elsewhere. I prefer to configure everything by hand (Slackware or Gentoo), rather than relying on a wizard on control center (Suse or Fedora). Other people think otherwise. I prefer to build apps from source (tar.gz or .tgz), others like packages (.deb or .rpm). <br /><br />It's all Linux, but from a different point of view. Some see the fragmentation between distros as a weakness, but I see it as a strength. There is something for everybody. The issue goes beyond the KDE/Gnome desktop.</div>
