					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I got FreeBSD 4.5 installed on my Laptop.<br /><br />It's a Toshiba Tecra 500CS (Dual Scan Screen). &nbsp;133mhz, 80mb ram, 3.2gb HD, 6x CD-ROM (I think), floppy drive, 14.4k modem, 10/100 ethernet, sound card of some sort.<br /><br />Installation went fine, I need to custom config the kernel for my sound support. &nbsp;XWindows was a pain to get configured, I gave up and downloaded someone else's working config file and tweaked it for my own preferences. &nbsp;Now X works happily.<br /><br />Tried Gnome 1.4, too slow. &nbsp;Tried KDE 2.2.2, way too slow. &nbsp;fvwm - too ugly. &nbsp;WindowMaker -- just right ;)<br /><br />Well now I have my laptop on-duty again maybe I can get back to programming. &nbsp;Want to learn Object Oriented programming in C++ / Java, I'll let you know how it goes.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">How did you install it? I mean was it from a CD or Hard Drive or FTP. &nbsp;I have an old Dell Latitude that is a 133 Mhz, 40Mb ram ( the Max for it) but I don,t have a CD drive for it. &nbsp;When I have tried to put some type of Linux on it I usually copy the CD over to the Windows partition and install from there. &nbsp;What does Window maker look like? &nbsp;I have tried Enlightenmet on it before and it I really don't know what to do with it.( I don't know how to navigate it.) <br />Thanks for the input.<br />Jeff</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I installed from CD but I have also installed via FTP before, so that works if you are networked.<br /><br />I haven't gotten around to getting my network card working yet, I need to compile a custom kernel. &nbsp;But I'm using a theme off themes.org, so it currently looks like:<br /><br />(http://images.freshmeat.net/screenshots/25857.jpg)<br /><br />Runs fine, WindowMaker is pretty easy to use once you get used to it. &nbsp;Since my laptop can only do 800x600 on the LCD screen, the fact that there's not taskbar on the bottom of the screen is helpful, leaves me with a little more room.<br /><br />And it actually runs good. &nbsp;Gnome and KDE were too slow to use really. &nbsp;With Gnome / KDE running I had around 5mb ram free on average, with WindowMaker running I have like ~ 32mb free (80mb total system ram).<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I had trouble getting KDE to work one time. I worked in WM until I could get it going. I really found it easy to use. It did take a few minutes to get used to, but slick and functional. Not as pretty, but works well. <br /><br />Once you get into a program, you don't even realize that you have a different window manager going than what you are used to.<br /><br />jdennis, right mouse click. That takes care of most of your navigation.<br /><br />David</div>
