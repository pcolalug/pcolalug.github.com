Patrick Eaton, Tokyo PC Users Group<br />&quot;Shipping books from overseas has always been time-consuming and<br />costly. Buying books locally is costly, too, and often means putting up<br />with limited selections, especially in the area of technical<br />books--which are the kind I crave most....Fortunately, [this isn't] a<br />problem any more. I've just signed up for my own Safari Bookshelf.&quot;<br /><br />Your group can also participate in this introductory program just for<br />user group members. To &quot;Go on Safari,&quot; any of your members who sign up<br />for our Safari 14-day free trial send comments on their experiences, or<br />tips and tricks for how they used Safari &nbsp;(it only needs to be 2<br />sentences long, but it may be longer) to safari_talk@oreilly.com.<br /><br />Every week someone will be chosen from the tips or comments submitted<br />to receive fun stuff from O'Reilly (T-shirts, book bags, or other<br />surprises). If a member of your user group is selected, your group<br />receives free gifts, too. Whatever the individual member receives, your<br />UG will get one, too, to give away at your next meeting, or use however<br />you see fit. Recipients--and their comments--will be announced in the<br />User Group Newsletter.<br /><br />**Please use this special UG URL to sign up for the 14-day trial**<br />http://www.oreilly.com/safari/ug<br /><br />For more information on Safari:<br />http://safari.oreilly.com/<br /><br />================================================<br />News From O'Reilly & Beyond<br />================================================<br />---------------------<br />General News<br />---------------------<br />***Head First: Just Bring Your Brain<br />Wacky themes, far-out images, and strange examples--O'Reilly's new Head<br />First book series helps you learn with stories, games, and pictures.<br />Learning a new technology doesn't have to be boring; see for yourself<br />with O'Reilly's upcoming &quot;Head First Java.&quot;<br />http://headfirst.oreilly.com/<br /><br />Head First Java (Out this month)<br />Order Number: 4656<br />http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/hfjava/<br /><br /><br />***Electronic Archaeology<br />It takes time to make a good mess. Programs start out simple, but then<br />the code evolves (or devolves) over the years. Different people work on<br />it, and it appears many of them knew very little about programming. The<br />result for professional programmers is having to deal with badly<br />designed, badly implemented, uncommented, incomprehensible blobs. The<br />art of digging through ancient, muddled code is called &quot;electronic<br />archaeology,&quot; and this article, by Steve Oualline, author of &quot;Practical<br />C++ Programming, 2nd Edition,&quot; discusses some of the tools you can use<br />to make your code &quot;digs&quot; easier.<br />http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2003/04/29/steveoaulline.html<br /><br />Practical C++ Programming, 2nd Edition<br />Order Number: 4192<br />http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/cplus2/<br /><br /><br />***Feed Your Head at ETech 2003<br />A week in Santa Clara for the O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference<br />provided attendees with lots to chew on. Daniel Steinberg gives an<br />inside look at the people and the topics that helped make this such a<br />satisfying event.<br />http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2003/05/01/etech.html<br /><br />---------------------<br />Open Source<br />---------------------<br />***OSCON Keynotes<br />Nathan Torkington: &quot;I've had people asking me what's up with OSCON this<br />year--is anything interesting happening or can they skip it and watch<br />'Alias' reruns instead. I can't make your decision for you (the<br />relative attractiveness of the Alias lady and Larry Wall is something<br />I'll leave to you to weigh) but I can definitely talk a little about<br />what I'm jazzed about.&quot; http://www.onlamp.com/pub/wlg/3151<br /><br />***Open Source and Open Standards<br />Open source means open code. It usually also means open standards. Are<br />they really so tightly intertwined? Which is more important to openness<br />in technology? Peter Saint-Andr explores these thoughts.<br />http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2003/04/29/openstandardsopensource.html<br /><br />---------------------<br />Java<br />---------------------<br />***Creating Richer Hyperlinks with JSP Custom Tags<br />Gone are the days where one destination per link was enough. With<br />mirroring, localization, and internationalization, your readers might<br />want the choice of several different resources for any given link.<br />Until XLink and XPointer are well-supported in browsers and authoring<br />tools, most alternatives are clumsy. Amit Goel demonstrates a better<br />approach by creating a custom JSP tag to control a dynamic menu of<br />destination links.<br />http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/04/30/jsp_hyperlinks.html<br /><br />---------------------<br />.NET<br />---------------------<br />***The Secrets of Strong Naming<br />If you've been working with .NET for any length of time, you've<br />probably run across the concept of a strong name. No, that doesn't mean<br />that your assemblies should have names like MyCompany.Gorilla.Biceps.<br />The strength of a strong name lies in the protection that it offers<br />your assemblies. The .NET Framework uses strong names to identify<br />assemblies and to protect them from tampering. In this article, Mike<br />Gunderloy shows you how strong names are constructed and demonstrates<br />the mechanics of working with strong names in .NET.<br />http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2003/04/28/strongnaming.html<br /><br />---------------------<br />Mac<br />---------------------<br />***Apple Brings Good Karma to Online Music<br />At a much anticipated media event in San Francisco, Steve Jobs<br />announced Apple's new online music service, an updated version of<br />iTunes and third-generation iPods. Here are the details complete with<br />audio clips and photos from the presentation.<br />http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/q/all_mac_articles<br /><br /><br />***Freeware Gems for Mac OS X<br />Here's a collection of lesser-known freeware gems available for Mac OS<br />X. We're talking about neat little apps that you might not have heard<br />of, but that can do the job just as well as better-known (and much more<br />expensive) varieties without you having to pay a penny for them.<br />http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2003/04/25/freeware.html<br /><br />================================================<br />News From Your Peers<br />================================================<br />***Twin Cities PHP Users Group Meeting, St. Paul, MN--May 14<br />This meeting will feature Steve Lime, creator of Mapserver giving an<br />introduction to using scripting languages like PHP to create dynamic<br />web based spatial reports (otherwise known as maps)<br /><br />May 14, 7:00pm<br />Offices of Minnesota Public Radio<br />45 East Seventh Street<br />St. Paul, MN 55101<br /><br />For more information and directions:<br />http://tcphp.org<br /><br /><br />***Syracuse Area Java Users Group Meeting, Dewitt, NY--May 21<br />This meeting will feature &quot;Ant: Building Mountains or Mole Hills.&quot; They<br />will review the use of Ant and provide examples of enterprise level<br />builds (JSP, Servlet, EJB, etc) usually not found in the current<br />literature.<br /><br />May 21, 6:00pm<br />Partners In Health Systems<br />5789 Widewaters Parkway--1st Floor<br />Dewitt, NY 13214<br /><br />Contact Bob Krause at bkrause@phs-us.com if you plan on attending or<br />need more information.<br /><br />Until next time--<br /><br />Marsee</div>
