					Title: <b>Laptop lid closing and Beryl video</b><br />
					Post by: <b>Yossarian</b> on <b>August 18, 2007, 09:39:08 pm</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have two questions and I&#039;m not sure if there&#039;s a solution or not. &nbsp;I have a Dell Inspiron E1505 laptop, 1.83 Ghz Centrino Duo, 1 Gb RAM, 945GM Intel graphics card (224 MB). &nbsp;I&#039;m running PCLinuxOS.<br /><br />1) &nbsp;Whenever I close the lid on my laptop and then open it again, the screen won&#039;t come back on. &nbsp;The system doesn&#039;t go into standby or hibernate, and I&#039;ve tried Ctrl+Alt+F1 then Alt+F7. &nbsp;This happens whenever I run any linux distro, live or installed.<br /><br />2) &nbsp;I also run Beryl, but whenever I play a DVD in xine the video doesn&#039;t really &quot;wrap around&quot; or anything.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I can&#039;t help you much with the first issue, though that sounds like you&#039;re having a problem with your ACPI setup.&nbsp; That might be an avenue that you wish to explore.<br /><br />As to the second problem: What happens when you try to wrap a video around?&nbsp; Does the video continue playing (ie, audio with no visible picture)? Does the video stop playing completely?&nbsp; Does xine crash?&nbsp; Does your xserver crash?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You were right.&nbsp; I tinkered around a bit with my ACPI setup and it stopped going blank, but just went into hibernate.<br /><br />As for the beryl, I guess my computer just cannot handle moving images whilst rotating the beryl/compiz cube, since it did this under OpenSUSE as well.&nbsp; Though, streaming videos worked fine.<br /><br /><br />But, recently I&#039;ve migrated to the new Fedora 8 release, so, we&#039;ll see once I get beryl installed there.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If anyone is still interested in helping me tackle this prblem (supposedly others have the same issue), this screenshot may help you understand what it is.<br /><br />http://i54.photobucket.com/albums/g96/Yossarian_3990/snapshot1-1.png<br /><br />The blue part should be the movie.&nbsp; But, KSnapshot takes it as all blue.&nbsp; In real life, you can see the video in the same place it was before the cube/effects.<br /><br />http://i54.photobucket.com/albums/g96/Yossarian_3990/snapshot2.png<br /><br />Space Mutiny, however, on Google Video bends just fine.&nbsp; (this is the desired result for Kaffeine/MPlayer/VLC I guess you could say).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay.&nbsp; Update!<br /><br />It&#039;s fixed.&nbsp; It was a problem with my video card, Intel 945GM.&nbsp; A lot of other users have this problem with the blue patches appearing.<br /><br />The solution was found here:<br /><br />http://forum.compiz-fusion.org/showthread.php?t=4065</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I did not really understand or look into the issue, so I was not much of a help, but I wanted to say <b>THANK YOU</b> for posting what you found out. That is the way the forum will be able to help others.<br /><br /></div>
