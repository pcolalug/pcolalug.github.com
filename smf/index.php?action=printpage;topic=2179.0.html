					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">At first I thought you were being a little harsh since I had barely scrolled down the page and was already in the O's and P's, then I realized that I was still in the capitalized package section and the lowercase section is huge. That is a lot of packages not included in the download version. Does anyone know if there is an easy way to download and update all of those packages through some sort of SUSE update once you install the dvd or would I have to hunt all of the RPMs down and/or compile from source? I was thinking about trying SUSE out, but not so sure now.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yes, Suse has a GUI (called YAST or YOU, can't recall which) that you can use to install apps from internet repositories after an install. &nbsp;I've always found it to be a little awkward to understand, but I think it works well.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: Rugmonster</div><div class="quote">With that list, I have to wonder what <b>is</b> included.</div><br />That was an amazingly long list. I did not really look at what was on the list, but it seems that alot has been left out (which, in my opinion is just fine, they should have the option to include anything they want or not to entice you to buy the software). It makes me wonder if a DVD is justified or if it would now all fit on 3 CDs.<br /><br />I don't have a DVD burner and my Linux box does not even have DVD reading capabilities.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">According to what I've read - it's perfectly legal and fine with SuSE to copy and redistribute the CDs / DVDs from the boxed Pro version. <br /><br />http://www.techsoup.org/forums/index.cfm?fuseaction=read&amp;forum=2016&amp;id=56186&amp;cid=117&amp;mid=192156 <br /><br />So - could someone bring me a copy of 9.2 to the meeting? &nbsp;<br /><br />Nick<br />[/quote]</div>

This is the downloaded version.<br /><br />The purchased copy of SuSE contains commercial software and can't be freely distributed without the consent of each of the commercial license holders.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey Steve - you still working at &nbsp;Best Buy? &nbsp;I was wondering what happened to all the Athlon 64 laptops? &nbsp;Will they be coming back? &nbsp;I saw a few (I think emachines and compaq specifically) last year but just went up a few days ago to look around any couldn't find any.<br /><br />Nick</div>

I'm pretty sure if you talk to a sales person, they can be special ordered and customized for your needs. (Maybe even with Linux preinstalled, not sure though)<br /><br />Steve</div>
