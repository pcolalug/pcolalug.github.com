					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just interested in what everyone's thoughts are on Apple's switch to Intel. &nbsp;And assuming anybody can buy a copy of OSX for their x86 PC, how will that affect Linux? &nbsp;Would you use it instead of Linux? <br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">From everything I've heard, they are only going to make it available for Apple systems. It would basically be the same as the way things are now, only instead of having a PPC, there is an x86 (presumably 64-bit) inside. This really doesn't change anything. The one thing Apple has right now is a stable platform due to great drivers. They know what hardware must be supported because they give it the big blessing. If they were to open OS X up to all of the other computers currently running Linux, *BSD, Solaris x86 or possibly Windows, they are going to have to worry about a lot more hardware.<br /><br />Besides, why would I pay money and lose freedom by going back to a commercial OS?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">With an x86 port of Apple, I think it would invite Linux users to try Apple's OS X, and increase the number of people who dual boot between Linux and Apple. It would not be too difficult to add GRUB to the Apple boot firmware so that you could install Linux (or even Windows) to the x86 Apple computer. PPC Linux users already have to do this, and Darwin x86 has been around for a while. The ground work for installing Linux to the new Apple x86 computers has already been laid out. <br /><br />Either way, Apple and Linux will both win by taking more of the market away from Microsoft. Linux runs rather quickly on Apple hardware, so I think the number of Linux users may increase once people realize this fact.<br /><br />If I could obtain a new Apple x86 computer minus the OS, I would throw Linux on there in a heartbeat. Apple engineers are very careful to make all the hardware mesh well together.</div>

You realize that when they make the move to an x86 architecture, there is going to be very little difference from it and one you build yourself. The main difference will be that the one you buy from Apple will be able to run OS X.<br /><br />So, the only reason to buy an Apple x86 machine would be to run OS X. I honestly don't see it being a huge reason for people to switch. The OS will still be different from Windows, so even though a Windows system may have the same processor, you still won't be able to run Windows apps on OS X any more easily than if the processor was PPC, Ultrasparc or Alpha.<br /><br />Microsoft isn't the enemy any more than Apple is. In fact, I wonder if they are really the &quot;enemy&quot; at all. I think that if people want to use Windows, Mac OS X, Solaris or whatever, they do it for a reason. I question the tactics of those companies, but they are doing what businesses do. Competition is great for the prices consumers pay as well as innovation, but there are higher ideals behind the F/OSS movement. <br /><br />I honestly don't see how Apple using a different processor would encourage more people to use Linux, any of the BSDs or any other free operating system. I also don't see it as a way to pull users away from those free systems either because of the reasons they use it. A processor is just a processor and Apple is going to make sure it's pride and joy, OS X, only runs on the hardware they make.</div>

Even with a closed-source core OS, Apple gives me choice due to the underlying BSD core. Also, some people do not care about open source; they only care that the **** works.

Even Microsoft Windows would be stable if they limited the hardware that the software was deployed on.

[/quote]<br /><br />Microsoft is the enemy, because they are unlike Apple or Sun, which both have (or had until recently) proprietary processors and proprietary OS, but with open source components and open source contributions. I do not mind closed source, as long as you are still contributing to open source, and your **** works. Both Apple and Sun products do work, and work better for ME than Microsoft products.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think it is early to guess what the move will do. &nbsp;Switching to Intel has become a necessity because the PowerPC is just not going to keep up with Intel going forward. &nbsp;If they don't make the switch, Apple could simply lose its ability to compete at all.<br /><br />It isn't about taking market share from Microsoft, if market share is considered at all; it's about taking market share from everyone.<br /><br />OS Xi will only run on Apple produced hardware. &nbsp;I understand the Windows will run on the current test hardware available from Apple because it is fairly standard.<br /><br />I find it interesting that two years ago, Steve Jobs touted the PowerPC, especially Altivec and touted that the PPC was much faster than Intel's processors. &nbsp;For some things, it was and for other things it simply was not.<br /><br />Ruggy, I am disappointed in you. &nbsp;Why would anyone buy an Apple over building your own and running Linux? &nbsp;You answer your own question, OS X. &nbsp;Emulation will be easier as many developers have weighed in on because of Endian issues. &nbsp;We could see a much better version of VirtualPC or even VMWare.<br /><br />Getting back to why it could pull Linux users. &nbsp;In my case, I wanted a UNIX based system with a decent user interface, MS Windows, and decent games. &nbsp;Going forward, I am hopeful that Intel's ability to supply Apple with not just quality M chips, but a LOT OF THEM, allowing Apple to drop prices, increase speed, and reduce power consumption. &nbsp;Not all Linux users and/or developers want to build their own boxes or recompile something to get sound working on their laptops new BIOS-less laptops.<br /><br />I also don't think that this move will kill Linux by any stretch of the imagination. &nbsp;There are folks like yourself that won't or don't want to leave it. &nbsp;Those that don't understand why folks like myself pay Apple for their OS. &nbsp;(Check out opendarwin.org when you get a free moment.) &nbsp;Those that love to tweak that last little thing that you just can't do under OS X.<br /><br />For example, I tried OS X Server on a dual G5 for about 4-5 months in my consulting biz. &nbsp;At the end of the journey, I put OS X on the dual G5 and use it for graphics and development work, ordered a Dell Server and installed RHEL4. &nbsp;Dual G5+OSX Server? &nbsp;Close to $3k. &nbsp;Single CPU Dell server that more than handles the load at this point plus RHEL 4? Close to $500 and is much more flexible.<br /><br />Anyways, just my two cents. &nbsp;Have fun folks.<br /><br />Scott</div>

Why would anyone buy an Apple over building your own and running Linux? You answer your own question, OS X.</div><br /><br />No no no...you misunderstood me. Why would you buy an Apple machine, which will more than likely cost more than a system from Dell/HP/home-built, and take OS X off of it? I guess for the same reason people buy laptops with Windows loaded on it and run linux on it. I am 90% sure that Apple's x86 systems are going to be more expensive than comparable generic systems that either can be home built or bought from another manufacturer. Why the price premium? OS X. So you are already paying more for a system that can run the OS and you are also paying more for the OS itself. Why waste that money to run Linux?<br /><br />Most of my original post was written strongly from the side of RMS style F/OSS movement thinking. I do run closed software, even on my Linux box. Would I run OS X? Heck yeah I would...if I had the money. I don't really care what processor it is on, as long as it runs well. I think OS X is a beautiful OS and I would like to play with it more, but I don't have the money to pay for the system or the OS...and I'm happy with Linux right now. Even if I did have an OS X system, I would probably still have a Linux box around as a server if nothing else.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: scottstancil</div><div class="quote">At the end of the journey, I put OS X on the dual G5 and use it for graphics and development work, ordered a Dell Server and installed RHEL4.</div><br /><br />You may be interested in this...

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well the OS is $129. &nbsp;For a five license pack for your home, $199. &nbsp;I am not sure I would call that a premium compared to other commercial OS's.<br /><br />I have done the price comparison between Sony Vaio and the Powerbook, Apple won on price when you figure in all of the software you get with a Powerbook versus what you buy for a Vaio.<br /><br />For a commercial version of RH, my personal benchmark that I realize most folks don't share, $179. &nbsp;Of course you can get it free so many different ways and perhaps better.<br /><br />I see your point. &nbsp;I do especially for your case. &nbsp;I am hoping that Apple's costs will go down because they will have a supplier that can finally keep up with demand. &nbsp;I am sure it frustrates Apple when they announce a new product is shipping and they get innundated with enough orders to force them to backorder for months. &nbsp;Some folks don't want to hear, it will be 3-4 months before we can build your system. <br /><br />In any case, you are simply paying the same premium you would pay Microsoft, Red Hat, or any other commercial offering if their supply chain allows them to lower their hardware costs finally. &nbsp;On the other hand, you are paying for an extremely stable system because they don't have to support the myriad of hardware. &nbsp;<br /><br />Oh, and I am just arguing to argue. &nbsp;I haven't posted in so long I figure I would pull your chain first. :)<br /><br />Scott</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would pay for OS X if I could run it on my hardware. My biggest beef with Apple is the hardware. As seems to be the general consensus here. They have done *nix very well. But, I just hate the thought of paying for the hardware. When I can go into any computer store and buy components off the shelf for FAR less than a comparable Apple product, I just have to be persuaded to stay with the x86 platform.<br /><br />I am not against paying for stuff, but when I can get comparable or better for cheaper, I go with the cheaper.<br /><br />Here's to hoping that one day I can walk into Best Buy and pick up a copy of OS X (or XI) and install it on my non-Apple computer.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am not sure if Apple is quite ready to sell their OS at Best Buy or Fry's. It would dilute the quality of the Apple experience--it would no longer &quot;just work&quot;. I compare this to Sun fielding an x86 Solaris. Everyone is not going to jump right out and pick up x86 Solaris, since the beauty of Solaris comes from the sparc processor and Sun workstations. The beauty of Apple will show in Apple hardware. As a matter of fact, I bet if Microsoft were to field their own crap OS on their own crap hardware, that it would work very well.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I dunno. &nbsp;After switching to Apple, I am not convinced you can just go into XYZ Computer company and buy a comparable hardware and software experience. &nbsp;I still used my Powerbook as my primary workhorse, despite having a dual G5 desktop. &nbsp;For me, I have simply not utilized a better laptop in 6+ years and at this point I may have become an Apple Zealot for my Powerbook, which translates into wanting the same experience on my desktop. &nbsp;That said, the G5 was bought to be a high end server and I found OS X Server limiting in some ways. &nbsp;I guess my point is that I don't believe you can get the same stable experience on a PC latop versus a strictly Apple laptop. &nbsp;Apple has an &quot;advantage&quot; of not having to develop for a myriad of hardware devices and I suspect they will maintain that advantage as Apple has been about &quot;their&quot; way for a long time. &nbsp;I guess I have found myself to be happy in lockstep with the Apple faithful.<br /><br />Of course, if they sold OSXi for any old box, Windows/Linux on my Intel desktops would be gone in a heartbeat.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I had the same reservations before getting my Powerbook. &nbsp;Although I love my Powerbook, a couple months after I had a bit of buyer's remorse. &nbsp;Not because I bought Apple, but because I wish I had bought the 12&quot; model. &nbsp;And for my general laptop needs, I think the Apple iBook would have been perfect. &nbsp;At the time it was essentially the same laptop with a memory cap of 640MB and cache on the CPU was half that of the Powerbook. &nbsp;<br /><br />So now I am gonna get into the part that Jobs' reality distortion field won't affect me. &nbsp;I have a moratorium on buying new Macs at work and home. &nbsp;Until they release either a G5, dual core G4, or a new Pentium M. &nbsp; If you bought an Apple now, I don't think it is gonna suddenly have software stop working; it is BSD underneath the hood and all previous versions of OS X have been designed for cross platform. &nbsp;I have a reasonably powered 1.25 GHz, which feels like a Pentium 2GHz on most applications for me -- purely subjective.<br /><br />That said, I have one guy still running on a G4 Powerbook 800Mhz and has been on his laptop for 3-4 years now, running past his lifecycle. &nbsp;If we think that he really needs a new box, he will get a new mid-range G4 Powerbook. &nbsp;We have a 3 year lifecycle on laptops and a 5 year lifecycle on desktops.<br /><br />If you have questions, hit me in IRC.<br /><br />Scott</div>
