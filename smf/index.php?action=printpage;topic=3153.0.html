					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ubuntu 7.04 has been released and is available for download.<br />http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/704<br /><br />Among the notable new features I&#039;ve been looking for in this release, is built in support for the entire java tool-chain. (No more stupid gcj deps!)&nbsp; Also, proprietray codecs and drivers are easier than ever to download.&nbsp; Apparently it goes out and downloads codecs and drivers as needed now.<br /><br />Really looking forward to installing this.&nbsp; Post your impressions if ya decide to install it!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve been using pre-release Feisty for the past month or so at work and I like it. One of the most impressive features is the upgrade tools they have come out with for Edgy to Feisty upgrades. I did one system at work with dist-upgrade and another with do-release-upgrade. Where I had to do some tweaking following the dist-upgrade, do-release-upgrade was absolutely seemless. <br /><br />Note to those thinking of upgrading. You may want to wait a bit. I&#039;m running the upgrade right now on my desktop and I&#039;m getting very slow package downloads. I&#039;m averaging about 20KB/s, which translates to almost 12 hours to download the new packages for my system. The server installs were considerably less, but those have far fewer packages than a desktop install.<br /><br />Oddly enough, the CD image download I have going is clipping right along at about 500KB/s. I guess the package repos are getting hit harder.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Further notes on Feisty upgrade.<br /><br />I have an AD, internal DNS domain, rugmonster.local, that I use for authentication. Since Avahi uses a .local namespace, I could not resolve any of my internal machine&#039;s names by FQDN due to Avahi&#039;s mdns being checked prior to dns in nsswitch.conf. To fix the issue (and since I don&#039;t use Avahi for crap), I changed my nsswitch.conf to the following:<br /><br />hosts:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; files dns mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] mdns4<br /><br />The impact of all of that went beyond not being able to resolve names properly via DNS. I could not authenticate against the AD on my Ubuntu machine because Kerberos could not talk to the KDC since it depends on DNS for name resolution. <br /><br />So if you&#039;re having problems where you can resolve a host by hostname alone, but not by FQDN and have a domain with .local as the TLD, then you may want to try this.<br /><br />Other than that, it&#039;s been smooth sailing. The home file server is getting the treatment now, followed by the business&#039;s web server.</div>
