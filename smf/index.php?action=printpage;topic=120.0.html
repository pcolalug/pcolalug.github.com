					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here is an article (http://rss.com.com/2100-1040-954357.html?type=pt&part=rss&tag=feed&subj=news) about the new Palm m130. Not too new. It came out in March I believe. They advertised it as a 16 bit color device. Come to find out it is only 12 bit.<br /><br />How could they not know it was not 16 bit? They made it didn't they? I suspect that they knew all along, especially since they have already built a couple of others that are 16 bit. I think that they wanted to get a low end color device on the market without telling where they cut corners.<br /><br />It bothers me that they were dishonest enough to do this in the first place. But the kicker is that they are not going to refund any of the purchase price, nor will they take them back in trade. Their comment is, &quot;we're sorry.&quot; That's it.<br /><br />Something is wrong here.<br /><br />Their stock price is already down to $0.71. They have been a failing company for some time. This should do them in. Unfortunately, as we have seen in business recently (Enron, Worldcom, etc.) a company does not have to be honest to stay afloat. But one day it will catch up to them.<br /><br />I don't dislike Palm necessarily. I have never owned one of their devices. I use Handspring products. But I don't dislike them. I do dislike an industry leader playing unfair and probably getting away with it...for now.<br /><br />Handspring, by the way, reported their color device as only being 12 bit. This was back when 16 bit was already the standard.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok, now I am really perplexed. Palm says &quot;too bad, we lied to you and you have to live with it cause we aren't going to help you out in any way.&quot;<br /><br />Now, today, their stock price jumps 39.63%! What is the deal with that?<br /><br />Signed,<br />Baffled</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I was going to mention that, but I forgot. <br /><br />Another stock that I watch regularly is KKD (Krispy Kreme Doughnuts). It has done very well through all this economy. Makes me wish I were in Florida right now so I can go buy one. There is one up here (Scranton, PA), but that is almost 45 minutes away.<br /><br />Ah well. I should be home next week to enjoy. Yum!<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">(From the ariticle Steve mentioned)<div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Palm spokeswoman Marlene Somsak said the company plans &quot;to fight the lawsuit aggressively.&quot; </div><br />If they would have just done what was right in the first place, none of this would be happening. Now they are going to &quot;aggressively&quot; fight having to make things right.<br /><br />Something is wrong with this company's thinking. Besides the fact that they intentionally lied in the first place, they could have offered refunds last week and it would have all been over. Now they are going to be drug through the court system. It may not be a high profile case in the broad sense, but for investors watching the company, this won't be good for Palm. They are in bad enough shape as it is on the stock market.<br /><br />David</div>
