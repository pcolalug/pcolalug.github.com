					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I was reading some comments on a review of SuSE 9.2 and one of the comments mentioned that SuSE 9.2 is all auto and &quot;real Linux users&quot; use Slackware. <br /><br />My question is: Honestly, what percentage of your time on Linux do you spend working in the OS Tweaking it, Installing new Apps/Tools, or fixing problems, vs just using the Apps you have available?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm on slackware, well over 80% of my time is spent using apps. Considering it really isn't all that hard nor takes very long to get things going when compiling/installing apps or upgrading things. &nbsp;:wink:</div>

I'm not trying to flame Slack or SuSE. I was just quoteing a comment I saw that got me to thinking. <br /><br />I do (personally) prefer SuSE, because I'm too dense/ignorant to do anything in a shell. &nbsp;I prefer point and click. (I guess Bill G. suceeded in &quot;dumbing&quot; me down.... :lol: )<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">For me this changes at different times. Right now I am in serious use mode. Though I have been working with Ubuntu to get it set up the way I want, and I have a Slack install that is all about configuration (I am beginning to doubt it will ever be used, only tweaked) I am currently spending more time on my computer actually getting something done.<br /><br />If you had asked this question just 3 months ago, I would have said definitely more tweaking than using.<br /><br />I am getting tired of being productive. Maybe I will go back to using Gentoo.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok, as a Gentoo user and advocate, keep in mind that my vote did not include the install (though using stage 3/GRP doesn't really take that long from what I've heard). :grin:</div>
