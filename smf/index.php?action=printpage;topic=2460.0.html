					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That's right, it's time for our (roughly quarterly) LAN Party get-together! &nbsp;Here's some particulars:<br /><br />Date: &nbsp;June 18th<br />Place: &nbsp;All Pro Sound &nbsp;(806 Beverly Blvd, just west of W Street)<br />Time: &nbsp;2:00pm until...... &nbsp;approx 10pm or whenever<br /><br />If you've never been to one before, here's what it's all about: &nbsp;You bring your computer (and monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc...) and we all plug them into a local network. &nbsp;We'll have a game server connected too, and we play games against each other (more on that later). &nbsp;There can be other geeky stuff going on too, as desired, like assistance with an installation or other problem fixing. &nbsp;It's pretty informal. &nbsp;At 6:00pm we'll take a break for our normal PLUG monthly meeting, and then resume the gaming battles.<br /><br />In the past we've pretty much played Enemy Territory, and that will probably be the main attraction again. &nbsp;If someone really wants another game, post something in the Club Discussions forum and we'll try to accomodate. &nbsp;I know for sure we could do Return to Castle Wolfenstein...<br /><br />It's a lot of fun and you'll enjoy yourself if you come. &nbsp;We need everybody we can get, so plan ahead to make it! &nbsp;<br /><br />What you need to bring: &nbsp;Your computer, monitor, KB, mouse, power cords, headphones. &nbsp;There will be a large network switch provided, and probably plenty of network cables (but it wouldn't hurt to bring your own just in case). &nbsp;If you have some extra power strips, keyboards, mouse, etc... you can bring them in case someone forgets theirs. &nbsp;There should be some popcorn and soft drinks there, and feel free to bring your own munchies/drinks. &nbsp;Often we have ordered out for pizza if there's interest in that.<br /><br />Mark it on your calendar and hope to see you there!!!<br /><br />Dan</div>
