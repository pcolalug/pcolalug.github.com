					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Started learning Python (and GTK). &nbsp;Decided to port a mac-only GPL database client I like called &quot;cocoamysql&quot; over to Gnome. &nbsp;I managed to get the whole gui written up and code to load it all in under an hour. &nbsp;This is pretty nice stuff. &nbsp;<br /><br />Here's what I have so far:<br /><br />http://www.homeweb.org/~nick/linux/database-client/shots/<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Another language that is supposed to be great for being extremely quick is Ruby. I keep meaning to take some time to learn it. I know the Pragmatic guys (http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/index.html) love it and consider it to be the finest language out there. Back to Python though, I know portage (http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/portage/index.xml) is written in it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You gonna host this on sourceforge or something? What's the back end of the original app written in? Are you going to have to re-code all of that?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The original code was done in Objective-C. &nbsp;I'm going to rewrite all of it in Python. &nbsp;Partly because the existing program was only for MySQL and I want this to work with more systems. &nbsp;Also have some nice innovative features to implement that no other clients I've used have yet. &nbsp;More on that later (once I figure out if I can even get it working).<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Neat. Did you use some sort of designer or did you hand code the GUI stuff?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Used the Glade gui builder in gnome. &nbsp;I like the way it works - you design the GUI and store it as XML. &nbsp;Then your program calls a library routine that parses the XML to reconstruct the interface, and bind your actual application logic to the interface. &nbsp;<br /><br />NIck</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don't know, my only exposure to GUI programming has been Java Swing which is a pain to manage IMHO. &nbsp;<br /><br />Have you played with JavaServer Faces at all? &nbsp;I was wondering about writing a custom render kit that reads Glade XML file and renders as HTML JSF apps. &nbsp; Could be neat?<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sounds vurry cool. Could do the same with XUL, XSWT, or any of the other XML UI languages. I've haven't really done a lot with JSF, but Mike makes the whole thing sound really neat.<br /><br />Oh, and if you are tired of Swing, give SWT a try. The Visual Editor plug-in for Eclipse makes it really easy to layout and code GUI stuff (for SWT, Swing, and AWT). You can get the plugin via the Eclipse Update Manager.</div>
