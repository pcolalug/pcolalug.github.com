UT2k3, Unreal 2, and Doom 3, all class A titles are/will be available for your favorite platform. The folks at Bioware keep insisting the Neverwinter Nights is coming too.</div><br />Not my style of game. Where are Need for Speed, Crazy Taxi, Tony Hawk Pro Skater, Tiger Woods '99, Star Wars: Rouge Squadron?

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I tried an early prototype release of that game, maybe a year ago. &nbsp;Steering was done only with the mouse, it was so awkward I found it completely unplayable. &nbsp;Let me know if they've changed / improved that aspect ;)<br /><br />Nick</div>

My wife is the racing fan, maybe I'll see if she'll give it a spin and let me know what she thinks. &nbsp;Oooo, anyone for game reviews in the games section!?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">At the time I found out that I did not meet the video requirements. I had forgotten about this game. I would like to try it some day. But right now I am having too much fun with other projects.</div>
