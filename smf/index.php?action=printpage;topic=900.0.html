&nbsp;The book is organized well, and the Table of Contents looks like this:<br />- Chapter 1: &nbsp;Provides an introduction to Samba, it's capabilities, and describes some networking concept basics.<br />- Chapter 2: &nbsp;Describes how to install, configure, and test Samba on a Unix/Linux system.<br />- Chapter 3: &nbsp;Explains how to configure Windows computers to function effectively in a Samba network environment, including Windows 9x/NT/2000/XP.<br />- Chapter 4: &nbsp;Discusses configuring Samba to work in a Windows NT Domain.<br />- Chapter 5: &nbsp;Describes methods for using Samba shared resources from Unix/Linux clients.<br />- Chapter 6: &nbsp;Devoted to explaining the multitude of options available in the main Samba configuration file, and how to configure it to your needs.<br />- Chapter 7: &nbsp;Explains how network client name resolution and network browsing functions are configured and used.<br />- Chapter 8: &nbsp;Goes into more advanced discussion of file-sharing options, including permissions, access lists, and locks.<br />- Chapter 9: &nbsp;Discusses setting up authorized Samba users, and how to set up security and password functions for your network.<br />- Chapter 10: &nbsp;Explains how to set up printers on your Samba network, and how to allow Unix and Windows client computers to access them.<br />- Chapter 11: &nbsp;Provides some miscellaneous additional information about Samba, including scripting and internationalization.<br />- Chapter 12: &nbsp;Explains how to troubleshoot Samba problems, and describes tools and logical strategies to find out what may be wrong.<br />- Appendices A - G: &nbsp;Provide additional information such as configuration quick reference, example configuration files and options, and commands summary.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The first couple of chapters help a user get things started. &nbsp;For the most part, it is assumed that the reader does not have an extensive knowledge of networking principles. &nbsp;Obtaining and installing Samba is covered, and the basic configuration to get Samba file and print sharing started. &nbsp;The use of the SWAT (Samba Web Administration Tool) utility is explained in brief, to facilitate beginners getting a working config file quickly. &nbsp;In my opinion, the explanations for SWAT should have been much more extensive, as this is how many Windows users wanting to migrate to Linux will be attempting to set up Samba. &nbsp;The examples were very short and the topic seemed to terminate abruptly. &nbsp;In comparison, the next couple of chapters are devoted to configuring the various versions of Windows (including XP) to operate with Samba networking, and the instructions and screenshots were very detailed. &nbsp;This seemed a little out of place in a book about a Unix-based networking solution, but will be useful to Windows &quot;non-techies&quot;.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The following chapters discuss how the Unix clients are configured, and how to get file-sharing going between them and Windows computers. &nbsp;Excellent detail is provided on manually editing the Samba configuration file for more advanced file sharing capabilities, logging options, computer name resolution, and network browsing. &nbsp;Especially useful is the chapter explaining Samba users and security. &nbsp;Many new Samba users find that they cannot browse their new network because of password and authentication issues, and this section provides clear step-by-step instructions to avoid that common problem. &nbsp;Another very useful chapter explains how to allow the printer attached to your Unix machine to be used by all the computers on the network.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;One of the more valuable chapters is certainly the one on troubleshooting your Samba setup when things are not working as expected. &nbsp;The available tools and utilities are explained, and the importance of checking logs for hints. &nbsp;Then a logical fault-tree method of troubleshooting helps you isolate where to find the source of a problem. &nbsp;Finally some additional resources are given for further help if needed.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;For those readers already familiar with Samba, perhaps the Appendices are all that would be needed for a refresher. &nbsp;They make up about one fourth of the total book, and are extremely helpful. &nbsp;The Quick Reference section provides detailed explanations of every configuration option, including default and allowable values. &nbsp;The Command Summary discusses every option relating to the smbd and nmbd daemons, for more advanced users.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Overall, &quot;Using Samba, 2nd Edition&quot; is an excellent reference book for those looking to install, configure, and use Samba in a Unix/Linux/Windows mixed network. &nbsp;The book is clearly written and provides easy to follow explanations for commonly encountered problems. &nbsp;The reader should be able to easily complete a basic Samba setup, and move on to more advanced configurations when ready. &nbsp;Whether you are a professional network administrator or a casual home user, this book should be the only guide you need to succeed with Samba networking.</div>
