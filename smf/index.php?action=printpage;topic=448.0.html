					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just wondering what the requirements for getting a programming / web dev / admin jobs in this area require education wise. &nbsp;Those of you working in the field could post your thoughts or qualifications here, or if you want to be more anonymous just answer the poll. &nbsp;<br /><br />I just want to know 'cause I'm third year in my Computer Science program. &nbsp;I'm really burned-out of the math courses. &nbsp;Don't get me wrong, I don't hate math, and I'm actually pretty good with it, but I'm just tired of it. &nbsp;So far I've taken Int. Algebra, College Algebra, Plane Trigonometry, Precalculus Algebra, Analytical Geometry with Calculus I. &nbsp;And only that last one actually starts to count towards my degree &nbsp;:? &nbsp; <br /><br />I've still got to go through Analytic Geo/Calc II and III and Physics I and Physics II, and Discreet Math and one more upper level math, don't remember the name of it.<br /><br />Is there any other degree path I can go that requires less math and can still help getting a job around here? &nbsp;Or is ability/skills/experience more important to the local job market than an actual CS degree?<br /><br />How about CIS?<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have a BS in General Studies but what actually got me my current job was my certifications.<br /><br />Microsoft Certified and Citrix Certified. I'm working on my Linunx certifications.<br /><br />Also, my security clearance helped.....<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Stick with it! Good god, finish your degree....any damned degree! Don't wind up like me...in the Air Force, waaaaay under paid and stuck on a desert island. I am the poster kid of staying motivated in college. Ask rburt3 about how many times I went to Calc I my first semester of my freshmen year...and it was an evening class. Go to class and don't do drugs...not that I ever did drugs, but I certainly missed a bunch of class. I also suggest staying out of a job you really really like.<br /><br />In all seriousness, stick with it. I am going to settle for a CIS, but I want to do Unix Admin and I probably won't have it done by the time I'm heading into the civilian work force. CIS isn't so much geared toward dev work at all. It is typically very light on math and light on programming, so if that is what you want to do, I would say tough it out in CS. Plus, you probably get a math minor out of it by default. Maybe rburt3 can give you some advice too.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am the poster boy for not finishing up your education. &nbsp;I was an Electrical Engineering major at FSU in 1990. &nbsp;Several things from girls to alcohol kept me from graduating from there. &nbsp;I did get a degree, A BS in Engineering Technology from UWF. But to get it I went to class while working rotating shift work at the paper mill. &nbsp;Now I am 34 years old, tied to a job that I really don't like, with the threat of layoff's all the time. &nbsp;I know that the economy is in the toilet and everyone is facing job cuts but once you get used to making a certain amount of money it is hard to start over, especially if you have a family. &nbsp;Do the smart thing a stay in school and finish your degree. &nbsp;One last thing, once you get past all of the math courses, and actually get in to your field of study, college will be a lot more fun. &nbsp;After I left FSU everyone that I knew there had a much easier time. I hope I wasn't the problem. &nbsp;The classes you are taking now are the weed-out courses, the ones to see if you have the motivation to do what you really want to do. &nbsp;Remember that nothing you really want is every easy. &nbsp;Just don'tt give up.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The math will be the fun stuff soon enough when you get to Analysis of Algorithms and Theory of Computation. ;) Pay particular attention in your discreet math classes and skip diff-eq for Linear Algebra. The Cal track is fun and interesting but you feel gyped when you learn how to integrate most anything with a matrix and a few simple operations. Oh, and hold on to your Rosen Descreet Math book, as you will need parts of it again in AoA.<br /><br />This all being said, a BS is definately required if you want to get a livable wage in this area. The markets tight and its hard to find a shop where you can spread your wings and learn cool stuff. Also, folks don't seem to descriminate too terribly much around here between the CS and the CIS folks in my experience.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I was going strong at PJC, computer science scholarship & all, and then a contractor at Saufley said I could make big money there. At the time $7.50/hr was big bucks (1987) so I took it and dropped out of PJC. BIG MISTAKE!!! Granted, I now have 17 years of experience on my resume, but just last December got my general AA degree. &nbsp;:roll: &nbsp;I've been working on finishing up my BS in CIS now for about a year, and d**n THE HOMEWORK, but supposedly I should see some serious money once I add the degree to my experience. However, I will say don't expect a miracle in the salary department overnight - RBurt3 & I worked at Raytheon: he had the degree, I had the experience, but I guess I'm a better BS'er than he is. &nbsp;:twisted:<br /><br />Unfortunately, most of the employers in this area seem to have the misconception that the salary range for programmers is low. It's changing slowly, and I see it getting even better once the economy picks up.<br /><br />Keep working on it - it'll pay off. <br /><br />&nbsp;:wink:</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">hitechwizard, how hard has it been to find jobs with no degree? I'll be getting out of the AF in a few years with 8 years experience of sysadmin with probably an AA and worrying about how I will look against those with degrees.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">One of my functions is to hire people as a Unix SA (take that how you want, analyst, administrator, architect) for level 1 to 4 support for Wachovia Corp. &nbsp;We have a miriade of people with and without degrees. &nbsp;From what I have seen if you have made skills you don't need one, or if you know the right people. &nbsp;without the degree that's about as far as you can get at the bank, (would be technical advisor) or team lead. &nbsp;Which is why I am going back to school. &nbsp;The pay for Unix SA's is generally based on experience moreso then the degree. but you have to be willing to move. &nbsp;Location is also important, charlotte is a very rich area for talent so a degree is not as important, whereas pensacola which is kinda rich, with government contracts requires more degrees (i know this i used to work there a long time ago in a galaxy far far away). &nbsp;With the advent of high speed internet being redily available though more and more companies (larger companies) are finding it cheaper to let people telecommute. &nbsp;ok enough of this for now</div>
