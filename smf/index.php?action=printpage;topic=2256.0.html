					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have a BellSouth DSL connection and I have encountered what to me is an unusual problem. &nbsp;I'm running SuSE 9.2 with a Westell DSL modem.<br /><br />When I am online and I make an outgoing phone call and when I get and incoming one I get booted off the DSL connection and the only solution that works so far is to reboot the PC.<br /><br />I dont know if I have a software problem or a funky phone line.<br /><br />Any help appreciated.<br /><br />Chuck<br /><br /><br />http://www.pcola.com/sandspur/</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It sounds like it is a computer related problem. Does not seem to me that the phone line would be it. One way to check that is to plug in directly to the phone box outside (don't know about the P'cola area, but back in Tennessee our boxes had a jack to plug in for testing). I suspect it still will happen though.<br /><br />If there were a problem with the physical line, DSL or phone would be messed up. Are you using the DSL filters? I would rather suspect you are since, in my experience, there is a noticeable quality drop on the phone without them. I don't know if using, or not using the filters affects the DSL.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi David---<br /><br />I'm using a DSL filter on the DSL line but not the phone line. &nbsp;Have extra filters so I'll put on on the phone line also. &nbsp;Thanks.<br /><br />Chuck<br />http://www.pcola.com/sandspur/</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The problem would seem to be with the filters without going farther into it.<br /><br />The line going to the DSL modem does not need a dsl filter and could possibly be one of the main parts of the issue. put the dsl filters on all lines going to your phones/faxes/etc...basically anything that uses a phone line needs a filter omitting the dsl modem itself.<br /><br />hopefully that helps.</div>
