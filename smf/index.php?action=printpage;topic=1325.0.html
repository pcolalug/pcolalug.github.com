					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I forgot it was game night (my gaming computer has been down for about 3 weeks). So I agreed to go out with the parents tonight and missed it.<br /><br />I am game for trying Friday night this week. I cannot guarantee it, but I will pencil it in with disappearing ink and see if I can remember it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You will need the 1.02 patch which you should be able to find there as well. You will also want to download the map pack that is mentioned in this thread (http://www.pcolalug.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1233&amp;start=15). Find the post from hightechwizard that tells you the two maps that you need to download and put them in your etmain folder. Mine is at: /usr/local/games/enemy-territory/etmain. I assume that is the default install location.<br /><br />I just tried the links in hightechwizard's post and they did not work but there is information in that thread on other places to get maps. You can also just start the game and point it at the server. It should download the maps for you. Try to do that before the 8:00 event so that you don't eat up the playing bandwidth.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I was there about 15 minutes after 8 and it worked fine then. But... Jesse also came in about that time and said that he just got home and that the computer had to be restarted. I had the same problem a couple of days ago when going onto the server to goof around.<br /><br />I had a good time fragging hightechwizard while he was off getting a cup of coffee or something. Spawncamping is really not alot of fun when there are only two people in the game and one of them is asleep at the keyboard.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yup, I was there..., but the server wasn't playing. &nbsp;Jesse, I think you need to look at that &quot;watchdog&quot; portion of either the server.cfg or the maprotate.cfg (or maybe campaigncycle.cfg?). &nbsp;One of them has a watchdog function in it to prevent the server from doing this, and it seems that maybe you've removed it, or commented it out...<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Are we still playing on Thursday nights? I forgot to check this week, but this coming Thursday I should be free unless I'm running cable at a friend's house. Now that I've got a system that doesn't suck, I should be able to frag like no one has ever fragged before (<span style="font-size: 7px; line-height: 1.3em;">on this system</span>).</div>
