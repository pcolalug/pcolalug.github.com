					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi all,<br /><br />For a long time now, I&#039;ve wanted to test the idea of using live cds to create a &#039;instant cluster&#039; out of a bunch of unused PCs.&nbsp; Well, turns out I might be able to get academic credit and/or funding for such a research project.&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking about using clusterKnoppix (http://clusterknoppix.sw.be/) for the work, although I have to say it is seriously out of date.&nbsp; I might just roll my own version of the current knoppix, with openmosix kernel, userspace tools, and some cpu cruncher apps like seti, or folding, etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />I just wanted to ask your opinion of all this, I know some of you (brett looking at you), have some experience with this sort of thing.<br /><br />*edit<br />Just realized the last release of the openmosix kernel was like two years ago, so clusterknoppix is actually up to date.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yea there has not been a lot done with OpenMosix in the last 18 months. It has been picked up by the Isarelai.........(hope I speeled that right)Military. So that is where most of there development is going. Clusterknoppix is a very good choice and even if there was newer updates I would probally still choose it first.&nbsp; It comes with seti folding on the disk :)<br /><br />I have broke my cluster down to just 5 machines all running slackware with 2.6 kerenl and usertools 3.2 with MFS and Memory sharing.<br />I think you have to be on the development team to get 2.6 kernel now.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
