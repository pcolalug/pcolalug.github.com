					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello,<br /><br />I&#039;m Michael and I live in Pensacola. I have visited these forums back in the eairly day&#039;s of PCOLA Lug about 4-5 years ago... It&#039;s been a while. I was known as MJIMLAY or MJI1084... I&#039;m not really sure what I used back then. Anyway, I just wanted to drop in and say hey. I am now working in IT Support for a local triple-play FTTH (Fiber to the home) Provider. We use Solaris for some of our need&#039;s. <br /><br />I hope everyone is doing well!<br /><br />Take Care,<br />Mike</div>

I didn&#039;t have a car back then and was trying to finish up High School (I&#039;m 22 now) so I wasn&#039;t able to ever attend one. However, I am planning on attending the next one. I think it&#039;ll be great to finally meet everyone :-) I wouldn&#039;t went to this last meeting, but I didn&#039;t find out until a day before.</div>
