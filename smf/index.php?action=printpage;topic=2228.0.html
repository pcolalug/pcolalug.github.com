They are &quot;making some moves&quot; in the area that have not been staffed up yet, and your clearance will definitely get you in the door.<br /><br />As for a contract gig, they are also using Apex Systems, Inc. out of VA to cover more DFAS sites. Travelling gigs are being interviewed for. DFAS is 31 sites, Japan is in there too. :) The gig includes all travel/hotel expenses paid. http://www.apexsystemsinc.com . NAS Pensacola is supposed to startup in a week, you may be covering that for a few months before you take off for Oakland, etc. Colorado and Ohio are already rolling. Call the Tampa office of Apex, and ask for Andy Winkler. Great guy to work with, great company to work with, and they go to bat for you as far as the money is concerned.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />ms</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks microserf, I have a family so I want to avoid traveling. I don't mind say working from home and driving to customer sites or something like that, &quot;no Planes!!&quot;<br />&nbsp; I have also been appling for civil service jobs seeing if I can get reinstated too. <br />&nbsp; It seems the Pensacola area is just too small or the companies are small. Employers want to see you in person and thats a bit hard from Japan. They also tend to think your just window shopping. Since I don't know anyone there I have no &quot;inside connections&quot;.<br />&nbsp; So, I'm considering maybe posting an add for a job and a finders fee. Has anyone ever seen this anywhere or think it would work? &nbsp;I'm sure I would get a few mow my lawn ones etc... Just trying to figure something out, I'm down to 4 1/2 months to go.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alan &nbsp;:)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just PM'd you w. some options. &nbsp;Here's a little press release about American Water. Their call center will be in the old Service Merchandise bldg, behind University Mall off of Davis Hwy. Close to major highway access:<br /><br />Governor Bush Welcomes American Water Services Company To Northwest Florida ~International company chooses Escambia County, brings 220 high-value jobs to Pensacola-Region~<br /><br />TALLAHASSEE - Governor Jeb Bush today welcomed the American Water Services Company, Inc., an international leader in providing water and wastewater services, to its new home in Pensacola. Locating its customer service and technical support operations center in Escambia County, American Water Services Company, has committed to create 220 high-value jobs and make a total capital investment of $16 million.<br /><br />&quot;We are thrilled American Water has chosen to locate its customer service and technical support operations in Escambia County,&quot; said Governor Bush. &quot;Part of a reputable international company, American Water's expansion into Florida demonstrates the competitiveness and attractiveness of our communities in the world market. Certainly, this project will create many excellent jobs for the citizens of Florida's Great Northwest, and in turn, the region's dedicated workforce will enable American Water to forge great success for many years to come.&quot;<br /><br />American Water Services Company Inc.'s, origin can be traced back to 1886 when the American Water Works and Guarantee Company was founded. In January 2003, the company was acquired by RWE, a major European utilities provider and became American Water Works Company. American Water Services Company, the business unit for the Escambia County project, is a subsidiary of American Water Works Company. <br /><br />&quot;The additional capacity of our customer service center in Pensacola is part of our service excellence strategy,&quot; said Jeremy Pelczer, president and CEO of American Water. &quot;We look forward to further growing our business in Florida and to a long-term, mutually beneficial partnership with the state.&quot; <br /><br />American Water serves 20 million customers in 27 states, four Canadian provinces, Puerto Rico, and South America. More than 8,000 employees provide water, wastewater, and other services to the company's customers. RWE's water and wastewater division is the third largest in the world.<br /><br />&quot;This is a great success story for the Pensacola Region and demonstrates how effectively our state and local business expansion and location incentives work,&quot; said State Representative Holly Benson. &quot;The combination of a quality workforce and economic development incentives were the key for the company selecting Escambia County.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;This presented itself as an excellent opportunity for Escambia County to partner with the State and our local Chamber to bring quality jobs and investment to our community,&quot; said Escambia County Commission Chairman, Bill Dickson.<br /><br />The Governor's Office of Tourism, Trade, and Economic Development worked closely with Enterprise Florida, Inc., Escambia County, and the Pensacola Chamber of Commerce Committee of 100 to secure this project for the region and state.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I Well I have been back for two months now, mostly cleaning up after the renter. No luck on the local job front. I do have a possible job lead for Germany but would rather stay here. It seems much easier to find a job outside of the US than in it...??? <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alan </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I ran accross another interesting thing in my job searching. I new there was something about hiring people that were established in the area, but couldn&#039;t put my finger on it. Then one day I was talking to a tile company about my flooring and the owner tells me &quot;I only hire local people&quot;. Bingo, The little light in my head binked and a connection was made. So all I have to do now is figure out how long I have to live here to make myself &quot;local&quot;.&nbsp; Seems like such a crappy way to hire people, but I guess thats the way it goes.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alan&nbsp; :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Alan,<br /><br />My brother has an electrical contracting company located in Pace.  They also do home-automation, fiber-optics, fire alarms  security systems (not computer security), phone systems, etc.  Most of their work is commercial.  I don&#039;t know if he has an opening, or if this is something you would be interested in.  Just let me know if you would like me to ask him if he expects to have any openings in the next few months.  Either PM me, or post a reply here.<br /><br />Also, you might want to check out the following Pensacola area staffing agency.  I think do alot of temp-to-hire stuff.<br /><br />http://www.landrumstaffing.com/<br /><br />Good luck in your search.<br /><br />dennis</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks Dennis,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m starting to ride the emoitional roller coaster of job searching now. I accepted an offer to go to Germany back in September pending a new poly with a start date of January. Well its that time an no word at all!!!!&nbsp; I have ran into some anoying things, either you have to be born here or your dad dies and you take his place or you know everything there is to know in the world. I just had a e-mail exchange with the unemployment office, they have a job listed that requires all kinds of crap and a TS clearance. but because I don&#039;t have a soldering cert. don&#039;t apply.&nbsp; No wonder there are too many jobs and not enough workers.&nbsp; enough ranting......<br />&nbsp; Alan :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Boy I got royally buggered!!!!&nbsp; I waited and waited filled out paperwork and wait some more. It now looks like there was no job. I think the buggers might have been biding on a contract&nbsp; and didn&#039;t get it. They kept saying they were just waiting on a start date from the customer. Well two months after all of my paperwork was done I told them give me a start date or forget it. Well that was the end!! So now I have waited on them since last October until the end of this May for nothing. So to all beware of companies just collecting resumes for contract biding! They actually had me sign an offer letter that was leagally binding. Mean time I spent a bunch of money taking care of house things etc getting ready to go. Oh well, now I have to start all over real fast.</div>
