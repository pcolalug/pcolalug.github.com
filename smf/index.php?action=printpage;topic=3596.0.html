					Title: <b>Nerd Invasion</b><br />
					Post by: <b>Yossarian</b> on <b>October 28, 2009, 12:00:12 pm</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">As we know Nerd Invasion is in little over a week.&nbsp; As it stands me, green_dragon37, bhoff, and possibly Fretsejaz, who is very new to the LUG, will be setting it up.&nbsp; If any other members can join, I imagine we&#039;ll need the help.<br /><br />If anyone can bring the following items please do so.&nbsp; We&#039;ll need...<br /><br />- Power Strips<br />- Linux install discs<br />- Linux Boxes<br /><br />If you can think of anything to bring or something that I forgot, please tell me, I&#039;m sure I&#039;m forgetting something.<br /><br />Jason, our link to Nerd Invasion, suggested setting up a linux box for the game room.&nbsp; I personally don&#039;t have any hardware other than my personal laptop, so if anyone has any other spare computers, even OLDER hardware, lying around, please consider bringing it.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be bringing some Ubuntu Karmic install discs, as I&#039;m sure that&#039;ll be the most requested/useful, but will also bring some other distro installs.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, if anyone has a few spare USB drives lying around, see if you can put some lightweight distros on them in case someone with a netbook comes along.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It may be helpful to also have an extra monitor on hand as well as keyboard and mouse. I have a monitor and keyboard I can get to you guys if you need it. (This gives someone the ability to bring their box without the extra peripherals).<br /><br />Initially I was not going to be able to make it. There is a slim possibility that I can. Should know by the middle of next week. But I can get the hardware to someone if you need it for the day.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Good to hear you&#039;re definitely attending.&nbsp; We could use your macbook to throw off some pre-conceived notions.<br /><br />I&nbsp; think so long as everyone brings at least 1 computer we&#039;ll be fine.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got a controller and some games set up on my laptop for people to try, so I think we can use that for a &quot;demo&quot; PC.&nbsp; I can also bring <b>A</b> power strip, so we should be okay there, just don&#039;t bring 10 things that need to be plugged in.<br /><br />I&#039;ve got some Ubuntu 9.10 discs burned, one on USB, and I&#039;ll be making some discs with other distros as well later this week.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only got 2 flash drives, one with Ubuntu and the other with Puppy.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Mr. President, I will not be able to attend, but if you need a monitor, keyboard, mouse etc. to have on hand, let me know this evening. I am not leaving town until noon, but I will be packing until then. I can get equipment over to bhoff tonight or early in the morning if there is a need. I believe he is still planning to be there in the morning.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I certainly hope bhoff and green_dragon37 will show up.&nbsp; I can provide an extra keyboard and mouse, but not a monitor.&nbsp; However, I don&#039;t think we&#039;ll be needing an extra monitor.&nbsp; Thanks for offering though.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">What a morning.&nbsp; Three of us showed for the event, Yossarian, Fretsejaz, and myself.&nbsp; Nobody took us up on our offer to put Linux on their laptops, though we did get to put it on one person&#039;s phone (via tape and a floppy disk :D) and one guy&#039;s pair of pants (with an Ubuntu sticker.)&nbsp; Fun was had, Bawls were consumed, I for one wished that I had showed up when it started the night before.&nbsp; It certainly got our name out there to some!<br /><br />Ian</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That&#039;s great. Exposure is good. Maybe we didn&#039;t accomplish the main task of providing a service, but you were available and visible. Sounds like a good event.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Overall it was quite fun even if we didn&#039;t really do much.&nbsp; Most of the time was spent playing Assault Cube, which was a blast.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sorry to hear that you&#039;re sick.&nbsp; I had the good fortune to fall ill AFTER Nerd Invasion.<br /><br /><br />Most of Nerd Invasion happened over night, so by the time we got there things were beginning to quiet down.<br /><br />However we still managed to talk to some people about linux.&nbsp; Tell them a little bit about the LUG and whatnot.&nbsp; Mostly though we just goofed off and played games.<br /><br /><br />Another item of interest.&nbsp; Jason King offered to make our LUG some shirts, so if anyone here has any artistic skills, perhaps we could get some brainstorming for designs?</div>
