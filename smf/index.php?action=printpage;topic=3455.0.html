					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This is the first I have seen of this. I don&#039;t think the news agency handled it right, but the Linux community sure does look like a bunch of jerks.<br /><br />I think Dell should take some of the blame. If the lady called and said she wanted Windows they should not have talked her out of it. That is the job of LUGs, not the job of the computer manufacturer.<br /><br />Thanks for posting this.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It&#039;s clearly a planned and obvious dig/attack on Ubuntu/Linux in general.&nbsp; First of all, try going to the Dell website and see if you can (easily) or &quot;accidentally&quot; order a computer pre-loaded with Linux.&nbsp; It&#039;s not something you can do by mistake.&nbsp; You really have to dig to even find that offering.&nbsp; With the demonstrated intelligence of this woman, do you think she was capable of doing this?&nbsp; I also highly doubt that Dell &quot;talked her out of&quot; switching to Windows.&nbsp; I also doubt that she was ever enrolled in some online &quot;college&quot;.<br /><br />Most likely this is a good example of a &quot;hired gun&quot; article, paid for (indirectly, I&#039;m sure) by Micro$oft.&nbsp; It&#039;s facts are very suspect, and it&#039;s just plain shoddy journalism.&nbsp; The television station, reporter, and editor should be ashamed of themselves.<br /><br />It&#039;s articles like this that prove beyond any doubt that Linux is making progress in the world.&nbsp; The M$ schills are getting desperate when they have to resort to garbage like this.<br /><br />Dan<br /></div>
