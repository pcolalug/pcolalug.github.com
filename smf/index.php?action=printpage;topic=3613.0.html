					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Howdy all. &nbsp;I&#039;m David from Tallahassee. &nbsp;I joined y&#039;all for the Jaunty release party in Pensacola and I am interested in doing another for the 10.04. &nbsp;It is scheduled to be released April 29th. &nbsp;That would leave May 1 or 8 if y&#039;all are willing to hold a special Lug or can make that part of your quarterly meetings. &nbsp;Whatever works best for y&#039;all I can probably work around if there is interest in doing this.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey, David.&nbsp; I&#039;m quite sure we would be interested in doing this again, Linux swag is always a good way to get people to come out of hiding and show up! :D&nbsp; Making it a special event would be preferable, I would imagine!&nbsp; Thanks for giving us a good long notice that you would like to do it again, so we can plan something better for next time... Discussion anyone?<br /><br />Ian</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ubuntu looks very nice but it has become a vehicle for microsoft to infect linux with mono which it highly supports and even named Miguel de Icaza a microsoft mvp. Ubuntu has replace GIMP in the default installation to make room for mono and the very few applications that require it like f-spot. Digikam which will run on Ubuntu is much better and does not require the infestation of mono. Why is mono an infestation to linux you ask? Because you can&#039;t write a working application with mono without using api&#039;s that are not covered in the microsoft promise. That allows microsoft to have a legitimate claim of linux patent infringement. Here is a statement by the Ubuntu Technical Board on mono. You will note that they don&#039;t deny the patent issue they just say that no claim of patent infringement have been made . Quote &quot;Thus mere existence of a patent, without a claim of infringement, is not<br />sufficient reason to warrant exclusion from the Ubuntu Project&quot;. Microsoft wants linux infected so they are not going to make any trouble about mono until it is so ingrained into linux that it will be hard to back it out. Remember microsoft is pushing mono and moonlight to be in linux. Not because they keep their word and are trustworthy but because they extend and extinguish the competition. <br />I can not longer recommend Ubuntu to anyone. Just the opposite is true now, I speak against it. If you want to use .net use windows. Mono is just a subset of .net and there are so many better languages than C# that there is no reason to use mono in linux other than for the benifit of microsoft. The other languages are cross platform and complete, able to write applications without microsoft patent infringement. <br /><br />Here is the full statement by the Ubuntu Technical Board:<br />https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2009-June/000584.html (https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2009-June/000584.html)<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sounds like a good topic for our Debate forums!&nbsp; Fortunately GNU/Linux doesn&#039;t, and hopefully won&#039;t ever, be that tightly involved with Mono (or any other proprietary/semi-proprietary project) for its complete removal from the community to be more than just a passing bump in the road.<br /><br />As for the party, I&#039;m thinking about baking cookies, Ubuntu-themed ones...

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sorry for the lack of updates.&nbsp; Midterms this week and all.<br /><br />As for the event, &nbsp;David is going to be doing a presentation on the new Ubuntu release.<br /><br />As for the new venue, I&#039;m currently in contact with the head of the UWF CS department and it looks like we&#039;ll be getting a venue at the new Science &amp; Engineering Building. &nbsp;Though, since the building is in it&#039;s &nbsp;&quot;shakedown&quot; semester as he called it it may take a bit, so please be patient.</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay, so here&#039;s the deal. &nbsp;UWF is willing to let us meet in one of their lecture rooms in the new building. &nbsp;We will have access to a projector, desks free of diagrams and blueprints, chairs, and power outlets (the classroom is designed for laptops), so it&#039;s ideal for our meetings.<br /><br />No food or drinks, though nobody ever really brings them to SSI so this shouldn&#039;t really be a problem.<br /><br />However, the building is closed on Saturdays, so as of now this conflicts with our current plans for the April meeting.&nbsp; Since maxolasersquad is coming in from out of town to do a presentation, whether we have a change of location depends on if he can change his schedule.<br /><br />If you have any questions or comments please feel free to ask.&nbsp; I&#039;ll keep posting updates as they come in.</div>
