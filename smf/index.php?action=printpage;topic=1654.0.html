					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">... you owe it to yourself to check out UFO - Alien Invasion (http://ufo.myexp.de/?id=media). This is one of the nicest OSS games I've seen. Nice application of the Quake II engine. My son and I have been playing it during every spare moment this weekend.<br /><br />Keep in mind that the downloadable game is just a tech demo. If this is the tech-demo, this game is going to be GREAT!<br /><br />Oh, if you have mouse problems at the menu, let me know and I'll post a fix. (simple config file change, but I'm going to bed now....).<br /><br />Gentoo users can just <div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">emerge ufo-ai</div></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yeah, I played this before, it was the first version they released. It is very nice. I do remember having to compile from source and then put the compiled binary in the downloaded folder to get it to work. Thanks for reminding me, I think I'll go download it again and see what is new since I last played it. Oh, it is downloadable as an rpm on Mandrake 10 from the contribs mirrors, but I couldn't get that version to work and didn't feel like debugging at the time. Maybe I'll try it now. <br /><br />I can't wait til this game comes out, though. It looks very nice, game play seems pretty solid, and there are few games I can play on my machine under linux. I like the new weapons as well. If it has just a reasonable plot, I will certainly go buy this game.<br /><br />On a related note... I have Xcom: Terror from the Deep installed and playing it through dosbox. Not the quickest on my machine(733Mhz P3) but playable. I tried to run the windows version under wine, but I can never get it to run anything. I found the dos version on a site and used it instead. (Yes, I own the game). It is still one of my favorite games, though I don't think I have yet to beat it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Can't remember the project, but I seem to remember there was an effort to create an updated engine for the X-COM games. I want to say it was Linux-native and would use the data files from a licensed copy. Wish I could remember that one. I'd go dig up my old UFO Defence disks... Man, what a time sink.<br /><br />From &nbsp;the UFO-AI site, development looks active. Random map generator and reaction fire are in CVS I think.<br /><br />The tech-demo may not have changed much since you last played it, but there seems to be a lot new neat stuff in CVS. I may try to build from their repository this weekend.<br /><br />X-COM games had a plot???</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok, they never had a plot so to speak, but it had a little more storyline than aliens are bad, kill the aliens. That is all I am asking for &nbsp;:D &nbsp;<br /><br />Anyways, UFO2000 may be what you are looking for. It says it is multiplayer capable on linux, freeBSD, and windows and all you need are the data files from Xcom: UFO Defense. http://ufo2000.sourceforge.net/ I haven't tried it yet, but I think I will soon. <br /><br />Have you tried the multiplayer on Alien Invasion? If so how is it? Multiplayer seems like a great way to spend a few hours shooting at friends to me.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yup, that's the one. As for UFO:AI multiplayer, it isn't available in the tech demo. I'll try that build from CVS this weekend and see if its in there yet.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, there's &nbsp;no public CVS server. Looking over their forms, development is pretty closed. You can read the various threads for the debate. Guess we'll have to wait for the next tech demo :roll:.</div>
