					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello,&nbsp; everyone I was just wondering if anyone here is going to school for computer type classes. I am about to start taking a Network + online class from PJC, and i was wondering if anyone else here has taken it. After that semester I was plannin on taking the &quot;Fundamentals of UNIX&quot; Class they teach at PJC in milton, Has anyone else ever taken it? If yes, please tell me if it was worth paying for/going to.<br /><br /><br />Thanks</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Any education you can get is always good!<br /><br />Now that is out of the way I would not pay a whole lot for the unix class...........<br />You can learn more by setting up your own box and a few books and information sources like the internet and groups like this for free!<br /><br />That is just my thoughts on it some of the other guys may give you better options.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I agree with Brett; education is good.  However, if you have the desire and motivation, and don&#039;t mind reading books and online information, you can teach yourself quite a bit.  The good thing about paying for classes is that you get a certificate when you&#039;re done.<br /><br />Also, I noticed in another post that you&#039;re trying to get a cheap computer to experiment with.  That is the best way to learn networking and Linux.<br /><br />Good luck.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It all depends on what you want to do. The Network+ cert isn&#039;t that great. It&#039;s very low in value and for a lot less money, get a Network+ book and read up on it. You&#039;ll get just as much out of it as you would an online class. Network+ basically gets you enough knowledge to start learning networking. <br /><br />While networking and Unix/Linux are related, they are different and you need to decide if you&#039;re going to specialize in one or the other to start with. They are both very broad areas, so pick one and stick with it for a while. <br /><br />I agree with everyone else about the unix class. I wouldn&#039;t take a Unix class unless it were part of a Bachelor&#039;s CompSci or CIS program. A one off class isn&#039;t going to teach you enough to even make the time worth it, let alone the tuition. There are plenty of free and inexpensive print references. If you visit the meetings, you&#039;ll also pick up a good deal of knowledge. <br /><br />You just have to be patient and play to the learning curve. Things are getting easier for those wanting to get into Linux and Unix, but to really understand what&#039;s going on underneath it all takes more time, same as with anything else.</div>
