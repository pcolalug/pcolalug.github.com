					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1104_2-5237356.html?tag=header.newsfeed<br /><br />Despite Microsoft underbidding linux by $12M, sending their CEO to beg, and offering them free training and support, Munich has decided to go with Open Source starting July 1st.<br /><br />And off another article linked from that<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote"><br />Microsoft made one of its most dramatic concessions last summer in Thailand, where the software giant agreed to offer a combination of Windows XP and Office for about $40--hundreds of dollars below standard pricing. The package is offered through a Thai government program to put low-cost PCs in the homes of citizens, a program that originally had focused exclusively on Linux and open-source software. <br /></div><br /><br />Now that's fair, the Thai public gets XP + Office for $40 while we pay (according to bestbuy.com) $399 for office standard edition + $199 for XP Home, so around $600 for the same thing...<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">LOL....<br /><br />Open Office anyone? &nbsp;I'm sorry but if i can't instal a borrowed copy of office I object to paying money for it on moral grounds. &nbsp;:twisted: <br /><br />I just recently purchased Frontpage 2003 ($90) on behalf of my dad. &nbsp;I tried to convince him to use nvu but to no avail. &nbsp;<br /><br />You know the software industry has to be one of the best cash cow industries around. &nbsp;You invest a little time and money into R &amp; D and coding for the software. &nbsp;Then you package and sell each copy. &nbsp;Each copy costs like a buck to make so in no time flat you've paid off your investment, and are now raking in profits and saving up for your next R &amp; D. &nbsp;<br /><br />THEN of course if you're microsoft you make minor changes to basically the same program and sell it for the next 10 years[/quote]</div>
