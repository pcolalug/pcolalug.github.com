After a frustrating<br />struggle with the &quot;help&quot; feature, I remembered that I had just signed<br />up for Safari. I went online and within two minutes I had found my<br />answer. I wish I had started there in the first place!&quot;<br /><br />Your group can also participate in this introductory program just for<br />user group members. To &quot;Go on Safari,&quot; any of your members who sign up<br />for our Safari 14-day free trial can send comments on their<br />experiences, or tips and tricks for how they used Safari &nbsp;(it only<br />needs to be 2 sentences long, but it may be longer) to<br />safari_talk@oreilly.com. &nbsp;(Please include your UG name in the email.)<br /><br />Every week someone will be chosen from the tips or comments submitted<br />to receive fun stuff from O'Reilly (T-shirts, book bags, or other<br />surprises). If a member of your user group is selected, your group<br />receives free gifts, too. Whatever the individual member receives, your<br />UG will get one, too, to give away at your next meeting, or use however<br />you see fit. Recipients--and their comments--will be announced in the<br />User Group Newsletter.<br /><br />**Please use this special UG URL to sign up for the 14-day trial**<br />http://www.oreilly.com/safari/ug<br /><br />For more information on Safari:<br />http://safari.oreilly.com/<br />================================================<br />News From O'Reilly &amp; Beyond<br />================================================<br />---------------------<br />General News<br />---------------------<br />***An O'Reilly Focus on System Administration <br />System administrators find their responsibilities lying somewhere<br />between deity and janitor. Having the right tools and resources at hand<br />can make deity status easier to attain.

What goes on in these projects? How do new people join? What<br />motivation is there? Cameron Laird and George Peter Staplin interview<br />several core OpenBSD developers.<br />http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/bsd/2003/07/17/openbsd_core_team.html<br /><br />---------------------<br />Java<br />---------------------<br />***Putting XML in LDAP with LDAPHttp &nbsp;<br />XML is great for transferring information, but it really falls down as<br />a searchable store. Mapping XML into a relational database is, well,<br />tricky. Jon Roberts demonstrates that a directory database (LDAP, for<br />example) makes a nice compromise while building a weblog commentary<br />system. &nbsp;<br />http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/07/16/ldaphttp.html<br /><br />---------------------<br />.NET<br />---------------------<br />***SLT Performance in .NET<br />The Microsoft .NET Framework brings with it many new tools and<br />improvements for developers. Among them is a very rich and powerful set<br />of XML classes that allow the developer to tap into XML and XSLT in<br />their applications. Before the Microsoft .NET Framework was released,<br />Microsoft published the XML SDK, now in version 4.0. Which raises the<br />question: how do these two engines compare to each other in<br />performance? Dan Furmin shows you the results of his performance<br />comparison.<br />http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2003/07/14/xsltperf.html<br /><br />---------------------<br />XML<br />---------------------<br />***An XML Fragment Reader<br />Despite many potential uses of XML using fragments of XML text, not<br />complete documents, XML parsers require complete documents to do their<br />jobs properly. This article develops an XML fragment reading class for<br />Java. &nbsp;<br />http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/07/16/fragmentreader.html<br /><br />---------------------<br />Mac<br />---------------------<br />***In Sync with CVS<br />Apple's Backup and iSync applications are great for Dot-Mac<br />subscribers, but some folks prefer to &quot;roll their own&quot; when<br />synchronizing data among machines. The open source tool, CVS, is a good<br />solution for &quot;do it yourself&quot; types. James Duncan Davidson shows you<br />how to set it up.<br />http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2003/07/15/cvs.html?CMP=</div>
