					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello, all<br /><br />&nbsp; Like some, I was looking for a local Linux<br />user group and finally found one.<br /><br />While I'm not a linux newbie, there are still a lot of things I would like to explore.<br />I currently have five computers networked together, four with linux and<br />one with win98.<br />Looking forward to providing what meager assistance I can.<br /><br />Best wishes,<br />Lester Hetzman</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome to the forums! Hope to see you on the boards. Go to a meeting for me since I'm geographically unable. By the way, what do you do with all those systems?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for the welcome, I plan on posting when I can. I went to Books-a-Million last night but I didn't see any sign of a meeting (?).<br /><br />As to all my systems, they don't do a whole lot, but I would like to get an IT job someday and having a home network to experiment on is a real plus. I am also interested in possibly learning programming, maybe web and database development as well.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome Scarecrow. I hope you don't scare crowe (http://pcolalug.com/phpBB2/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&u=26&sid=12a0dd0afdd71e3190e3bb102a567202) from the boards. He has been helpful. :lol: <br /><br />I was not at the meeting last night since I am currently in the great state of Texas. I suspect they were in the coffee shop since the remodel job took out the space near the magazines.<br /><br />Look forward to your input as we need help. Post any questions/comments that you have. <br /><br />David<br />VP, P'cola LUG</div>

We met at the front of the store in the coffee shop. Anyway, we will probably be meeting at another place next month as Books-A-Million has remodelled and gotten rid of their spacious back.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for the welcome, Steve<br /><br />I didn't even know that BAM had remodelled, as this was my first inside for a couple years.<br /><br />Which means I walked right past you twice (GOT to pay attention!) :lol: <br /><br />Lester[/quote]</div>
