Our ideal<br />author has real technical competence and a passion for explaining<br />things clearly. We're happy to work with first time authors, and<br />encourage inquiries about virtually any topic. However, it helps if you<br />know that we tend to publish &quot;high end&quot; books rather than books for<br />dummies, and generally don't want yet another book on a topic that's<br />already well covered. &nbsp;<br />For more information, please check out:<br />http://oreilly.com/oreilly/author/intro.html<br /><br />---------------------<br />Open Source<br />---------------------<br />***Defending Your Site Against Spam <br />To users, unsolicited commercial e-mail is an annoyance.
