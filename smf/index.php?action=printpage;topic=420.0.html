					Title: <b>CRT or LCD?</b><br />
					Post by: <b>rugmonster</b> on <b>January 23, 2003, 11:22:49 pm</b>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I know I haven't been the only one to notice that the forums have been mostly dead. I don't count forum clean up announcements as topics of conversation. Anyhow, here is a question that I hope to spark some conversation with...<br /><br />With the recent news (http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,3973,841366,00.asp) of Sony ceasing production of &quot;small&quot; CRT monitors, in favor of LCD monitors, do you plan on moving to LCD? I personally don't care for the image on most LCD displays simply because they aren't as bright and the image isn't as crisp compared to most better CRTs. I can see a major shift in them for business users, but for people who care about the quality of their graphics, I still think CRT is the way to go. What do you think?<br /><br />...one more thing, yes I use a 19&quot; LCD screen at work and it is nice for desk space, but my 19&quot; (18.1&quot; viewable) CRT back home beats it by far in clarity and brightness, especially in games. I simply refuse to play any game on the laptop I have because of the display; so much that I will walk five minutes up to work to play.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here (http://www.tomshardware.com/display/20020114/lcd-02.html) is a portion of a good article on Toms Hardware comparing LCD and CRT monitors. The article is actually over a year old so things have gotten better. It looks like all around CRTs are better than LCD monitors. However, you have to take into account the desk space and power consumption of the LCDs. Less power consumption also means less heat. Also, it's nice that you can hang the flat panels on the wall behind your desk rather than taking up dekstop space. Working at Best Buy I get to see some of the latest flat panels and yes, they have come a long way. <br /><br />Another big advantage I've noticed is a the lack of distortion on the screen that you typically see with a CRT monitor. Of course, the higher end flat screen monitors don't have this problem either. Also, with a flat panel, you don't lose any screen space due to the case. In other words a 17&quot; flat panel has 17&quot; viewable while a 17&quot; CRT only has about 16&quot; viewable. That extra inch diagonal means a lot of extra display space.<br /><br />My plans as far as my next monitor goes are that I will be buying a flat panel monitor. &nbsp;<br /><br />If you're considering buying one, make sure you do your homework first. There are a lot of things to look for in a flat panel monitor and you don't want to regret your pruchase.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">of course if you are using Apple hardware, there is no problem. the Apple studio flatscreen monitors are better than many crt's... of course you get what you pay for, they are not cheap</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The new apple laptops now come with 19&quot; wide screen lcd's. &nbsp;That's nice :) &nbsp;Also if anyone needs a decently priced monitor they have 18&quot; (maybe 19 but I think it was 18) LCD's at Walmart on Mobile Hwy for under $400 last time I was in there.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just looked at it again. &nbsp;The powerbook is a 17&quot; screen, I was thinking about where it says &quot;The same viewable size as a 19&quot; crt&quot;. &nbsp;My bad.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm looking into getting a new laptop in a few months. &nbsp;I like the HP laptops, but I'd also like to get a mac laptop. &nbsp;My only dilema is price. &nbsp;I'm keeping an eye out for some good deals on slightly used ebay mac's, but nothing so far. &nbsp;Of course, I'd also like to have an apple lisa to play with, but that'd probably get old after a few days...<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am looking into getting a new powerbook soon, after looking at what is out there, I would say pound for pound the Apple laptops are a better value, not only for just the stuff in them, but also because they are the best made laptops I have ever seen. they are very sturdy and will outlast laptops by other manufacturers (they also hold their value better)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">We have the 17 inch flat panel LCD's at work. &nbsp;To me they seem much brighter and easier to look at under the fluorescent lights in the lab.<br /><br />I am planning to upgrade to one but am waiting for the prices to come down. &nbsp;I think that within a year (Christmas 2003 &nbsp;:wink: ) the price should be about right.</div>
