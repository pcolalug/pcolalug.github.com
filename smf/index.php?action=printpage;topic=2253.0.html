					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am a reluctant linux user. &nbsp;Against my will, I've just been transferred over to Linspire, which is okay, I guess. &nbsp;Anyhow, my &quot;administrator&quot; husband is always too busy to make the thing work the way I need it to and I'm sick of sitting around waiting to have my stuff fixed.<br /><br />I don't know a tarball from a bash shell and I need to install software, specifically something that can get the pictures off my camera. &nbsp;Digikam was working great when I had Gentoo and I'd like to get that. &nbsp;Here's the problem...I need simple, step by step instructions on how to do this.<br /><br />I've found things that say, &quot;put this script in the arjgoidlkdf, then make it an executable. &nbsp;Then run the woiedfvnkd, compile it, smack it, flip it, rub it down, and there you go!&quot; &nbsp;I need some hand holding here, friends, I need: &nbsp;Step 1: &nbsp;Turn on the computer... &nbsp;seriously. &nbsp;The only problem is that I don't have a k-wheel anymore so I don't know what to call things. &nbsp;That's another diatribe for another time...why don't the all call things the same thing?<br /><br />How do I install things?<br />LM</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Do you have Click-N-Run available to you? That is a feature of Linspire that makes it a most enjoyable distribution to use. And if your husband won't pay for the subscription you let me know and I will call the authorities on him. Making you use Gentoo then switching you over to Linspire without a subscription verges on spousal abuse.<br /><br />Inside of Click-N-Run, you can do a search (I don't know exactly how, but you should be able to find it) and search for Digikam. From there it should have a button to install it for you. That should be it. It does not get much easier than Linspire's way of installing software. I have already checked with Linspire and know that it is available.<br /><br />If that does not work for you, or you get stuck, come let us know.<br /><br />How do you like Linspire? You will find it much easier to use in time. You will be able to do your own software installs instead of having to wait for him.<br /><br />Tell your husband Al, that I said &quot;Hi.&quot; (Tell him I called him Al and he should get the reference, think &quot;Toys.&quot;)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You may be able to do the following...<br /><br />Open XTerm or one of the Terminal Programs (usually &lt;something&gt;Term).<br /><br />I believe Linspire runs all as root, so you should have a # as the last character of your prompt. Type the following to see if you can find digikam<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"># apt-cache search digikam</div><br />If it comes up with digikam, then you can type the following to install it<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"># apt-get install digikam</div><br /><br />If you aren't running as the user root and don't have the #, then you probably won't be able to install anything. My suggestion, when you get a chance to catch your husband in all his running around, beat him about the face and neck until he gives you the root password. And if it makes him feel any better, tell him you'll call your brother before using it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Go to http://www.linspire.com/digikam and click in the (http://images.linspire.com/cnr-button.jpg) button. &nbsp;The Click and Run service is $49 a year if you aren't already signed up for it. &nbsp;It will let you install any software in their warehouse with 1-click. &nbsp;You can browse the entire collection at: http://www.linspire.com/warehouse &nbsp;<br /><br />Since you are using Linspire, you might want to try out their camera program called LPhoto. &nbsp;You can see it at http://www.linspire.com/lphotomanager<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I did try the CNR install, but their package is broken. &nbsp;:( &nbsp; Sadly, this is usually my fate. &nbsp;Things break and I don't know how to work around them. &nbsp;For those of you who haven't tried LPhoto, it's LCrapo...doesn't work at all with my camera and is just plain awful, &nbsp;zero configuration.<br /><br />For what it's worth, I do have the root password! &nbsp;And as for beating the old man about the face and neck, he gets enough of that, he's practically black and blue! &nbsp;<br /><br />He's gonna kill me when he gets home, I wiped my machine and installed XP. &nbsp;Ruggy, what I'd like to do is set it up to dual boot. &nbsp;That way I can still learn how to 'speak the linux', but don't have to rely on it for my day-to-day necessities. &nbsp;Want to hold my hand through that?<br /><br />Thanks a bunch for the feedback!<br /><br />LM</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">oops! One more thing:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: dpeach</div><div class="quote"><br /><br />How do you like Linspire? You will find it much easier to use in time. You will be able to do your own software installs instead of having to wait for him.<br /><br /></div><br /><br />Linspire is okay. &nbsp;I think if they can get the CNR up and running like it should it would be better. &nbsp;When you go to install a piece of software it doesn't check to see if you already have it, and some of them are not labeled correctly. For example, KB3 is just listed as 'CD Burner.' &nbsp;Overall, it seems to be one of the most non-technical-person friendly distribution I've seen. &nbsp;I just don't have the time to fight with it!<br /><br /><br />LM</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: linuxmom</div><div class="quote">For example, KB3 is just listed as 'CD Burner.'</div><br />I HATE that!! Sure, call it CD burner, but tell me which one it is! I know the point is to make it easy on people, but I would venture to guess that the majority of people that use computers know which CD burning software they want. If they don't know, then they don't care and that is fine. But if you do know, make it at least possible. ARRGH!<br /><br />As for the XP, you ain't kiddin' he is going to be hot! I just wish I could be there to see that conversation. Then I would make sure everyone knew that his home is not a pure Linux shop anymore. &nbsp;:lol: <br /><br />I would have to think that there may be something wrong with your install, or your subscription if CNR is not working. It is supposed to work pretty well from what I have read and heard.<br /><br />I used Linspire for a short time. I really liked it. But it was too easy and I did not feel I was really using Linux. If I don't have to fight with it at least some, then where is the fun in that.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: 1.3em;">BTW, you are not as anonymous as Al might want you to be</span> :lol:</div>
