					Title: <b>Buying a Linux Laptop</b><br />

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm on the hunt for a new laptop to replace the Toshiba I sold a few months ago. &nbsp;I'm determined to order a laptop with Linux on it (or at the very least, without Windows on it). &nbsp;<br /><br />I know HP sells one but it's not a machine I want to buy. &nbsp;I really like the IBM ThinkPads so I've been corresponding with some of their people by email / phone trying to arrange it. &nbsp;But it's harder than I thought. &nbsp;<br /><br />One of the state-wide sales reps for education purchases passed on the information that it may be illegal for IBM to sell a product without windows on it in the state because of licensing agreements, but he wasn't sure if that's true or not. &nbsp;<br /><br />Anybody have suggestions here? &nbsp;Maybe if I purchase through IBM Europe or something I can get one? &nbsp;<br /><br />I know WalMart sells the &quot;Balance&quot; notebooks with Linux but again I don't really like the hardware. &nbsp;I like the ThinkPad, &lt; 1&quot; thick, 2.5lbs, and 7.5 hours battery life for the X models :) &nbsp;But also they're centrino based and I don't know how linux support is for them.<br /><br />Any other suggestions to look at as far as models of laptops that have &gt; 4 hours battery life? &nbsp;<br /><br />Was also considering an Apple ibook / powerbook maybe, but really do like the IBMs.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Have contacted IBM's Linux group directly to see if maybe they can help arrange something. &nbsp;<br /><br />Also going to contact Microsoft to see what my options are if I don't accept the terms and conditions of XP, I think I'm entitled to return it for a refund but don't know if I would be returning it to IBM or to Microsoft, or if it's even possible.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">For anyone interested, this is the only offering I could find from HP for Linux notebooks, you can get it with SuSE. &nbsp;<br /><br />Click for their website.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks Steve I'll check them out. &nbsp;I emailed Jon Hall (one of the speakers at the LUG fest) and he pointed me to this company http://www.netdirect.ca/products/ibm_notebooks.php so I'll be checking them out too..<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">To be fair, hp's desktops have proven fairly reliable.<br /><br />Then again, the western dig did acutally 'burn up' (with smoke and all). &nbsp;The case's small form factor makes it very hard to access components. &nbsp;Oh, and it only excepts 64 mb sticks of pc100 ram (wierd i know, we tested it).<br /><br />Now, my ooold desktop, on the otherhand (486/66 24mb ram 530mb hd) &nbsp;just won't die. &nbsp;I had to hook it up in 2003 because my notebook went out, and I had to use my parents desktop at college. &nbsp;First thing i did was format over win 3.1 and install slack 8.1. &nbsp;Did a basic install of 310mb (cli, X, dev, and a few tools). &nbsp;I was shocked at just how much i could sqeeze on it.<br /><br />I would have 3 ssh terminals open doing my java homework. &nbsp;One locally to edit, one to ftp the file to uwf's sun server, and another to compile. &nbsp;Might sound like a bit much but when the old 14.4 gets over heated at cranks out 500 bytes per second, which makes remote editing impossible.<br /><br />Ah the good ole days.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Nothing yet, but went to price one of the HP's since they're having a sale right now, and despite what this page (http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF05a/321957-64295-89315-321838-f33-395654.html) says:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Operating system: Microsoft® Windows® XP Professional,<br />Microsoft® Windows® XP Home or<br />SUSE® Linux HP Edition 9.1.</div><br /><br />I emailed them this morning and got back:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Thank you for contacting Hewlett-Packard.<br /><br />HP no longer offers a notebook PC that can be configured with SuSE<br />Linux. &nbsp;Prices, promotions, specifications, availability, and terms of<br />offers may change without notice. </div><br /><br />So no go there either... &nbsp;I guess I'll go bug Dell again.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Have you reached the point of almost paying the MS tax? It just seems amazing that they can't just offer the option to not load any OS on a new system. That doesn't seem hard to me. For testing prior to shipping, use a livecd. Believe it or not, there are actually Windows based livecd's. Wait, what am i saying? Of course they can't do that because it would be competition against Windows and I'm sure they have some clause in their OEM agreement.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well it seems to only be a problem with Laptops. &nbsp;Dell, HP, and IBM will all sell Linux based Desktop systems. &nbsp;And Dell will even sell you a system without any OS license (they install FreeDOS for basic system testing). &nbsp;But for some reason they're all Windows-Only on their laptops :(<br /><br />BTW: Found this article on linux journal offering advice on getting a refund of the microsoft software you don't want.<br /><br />http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php%3Fsid=7040<br /><br />Nick</div>
