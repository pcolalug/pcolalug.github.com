					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have a small network at home that I have never really integrated my dual boot laptop into (while booted into linux). &nbsp;I usually just run my linux laptop stand alone. &nbsp; <br /><br />Well now I have acquired an old 400mhz box that I am running strictly linux on and I want to integrate it into my network. &nbsp;I installed samba client and I could see my network and copy files fine and dandy. &nbsp;However after I shared a directory on my linux box, I could not see it from my windows boxes. &nbsp;So I figured that I would need to install samba server as well. &nbsp;<br /><br />After installing samba server and selecting the network and configuring samba (with yast, I am running Suse 9). &nbsp; Later, when I rebooted my windows box I got an error that the workgroup can not be the same as a computer name. &nbsp;Well I had my workgroup named &quot;RGRP&quot; and my linux box is named RGRP.LOCAL &nbsp;and when I configured samba server I slected RGRP as the workgroup. &nbsp;So I renamed my linux box to somthing else, &quot;linux.local&quot;. However I am still not able to see my windows clients or vise versa. &nbsp;<br /><br />I did all of this on an hour lunch break so I have really not researched it yet or really tinkered with it to see If I had something not set right. &nbsp;Just wondering if someone has an idea before I hit the net/books.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Lee</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">So if I am reading this correctly you have the workgroup on the windows box same as the workgroup listing in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file?<br />Also you have renamed your linux box to linux.localdomain.<br /><br />what flavor of windows?<br />did you add the users to the linux box?<br />&lt;smbpasswd -a username&gt;<br />can you post your samba conf file?<br /><br />when you install the samba server there is all sorts of things for security you have to set up. piece of cake.....</div>
