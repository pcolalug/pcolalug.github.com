					Title: <b>BitKeeper No Longer Used for Linux Kernel</b><br />
					Post by: <b>rugmonster</b> on <b>April 16, 2005, 07:28:43 am</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've been reading up this morning about the recent controversy over BitKeeper, Linus and Andrew &quot;Tridge&quot; Tridgell, author of Samba. As some background, here are some stories you may want to read.<br /><br />newsforge.com - BitKeeper and Linux: The end of the road? (http://os.newsforge.com/os/05/04/11/118211.shtml?tid=152&amp;tid=2&amp;tid=25&amp;tid=3)<br />theregister.co.uk - Torvalds knifes Tridgell (http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/04/14/torvalds_attacks_tridgell/)<br />register.co.uk - 'Cool it, Linus' - Bruce Perens (http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/04/15/perens_on_torvalds/)<br /><br />For those that didn't read the articles above, here is a short rundown. Linus has been using the free version BitKeeper, a proprietary closed-source product, for the past three years for the source code management system for the Linux kernel. Through an agreement with Larry McVoy, the author of BitKeeper, the community could use the free product for development as long as it wasn't used for a competing SCM project.<br /><br />According to Tridge, this is what happened<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: Tridge</div><div class="quote"> - In late February I wrote a tool that is interoperable with BitKeeper. The aim was to provide export to other source code management tools and provide a useful tool to the community.<br /><br />- I did not use BitKeeper at all in writing this tool and thus was never subject to the BitKeeper license. I developed the tool in a completely ethical and legal manner.</div><br />Because of this, McVoy has decided to stop production of the free product and given Linus three months to move the kernel sources off of the BitKeeper servers. Not only that, Linus encouraged McVoy to discontinue his free version and tried to discourage Tridge from working on the open-source client.<br /><br />Now, Torvalds has called Tridge unethical for his reverse engineering of the close, proprietary system that is BitKeeper, and has gone further in saying the proprietary systems are okay and there for a reason. What does this say for Samba, OpenOffice.org, Gaim and the myriad of other projects designed to work with proprietary networks and files? I have to wonder if Linus uses any other these products that have had to reverse engineer something to provide a level of interoperability with closed-source products.<br /><br />Anyhow, what is your take on all this? Is reverse engineering unethical? Should we all avoid products that have cracked the code on all those proprietary systems/formats and what would we lose in doing so?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I do not understand all the ethical ramifications of this in every sense, but I have been loosely following this as it relates to OOo.<br /><br />I am not sure where I stand on this. OOo does not *have* to provide compatability with MS. But to make it anywhere in the world right now, you almost are going to need to. Maybe the answer would be for OOo not to provide the ability to read/write MS Office formats. Then have someone elso provide a macro that can. This would keep the main project clean and those who wanted to step out on the edge could use the macro to import/export.<br /><br />On the other hand, if they go about reverse engeneering in an ethical way (by not peeking at source code) then I really don't have a problem with it. <br /><br />I bought a radiator cap for my Chevrolet that was not produced by any officially licensed GM company. Have I done something ethically wrong? No, I don't think so. Now, if my radiator cap blows up and destroys my truck, I have no recourse against GM for their faulty radiator cap. We accept RE in almost every area of life, particularly in hardware (computer or otherwise), why not in software?</div>
