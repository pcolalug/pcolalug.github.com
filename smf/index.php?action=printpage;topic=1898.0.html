					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">As seen in my gaming rig thread, I'm getting a Athlon64. &nbsp;To this end, I was thinking about running 64-bit Linux. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;I dunno, bragging rights maybe, never done it before, and a perverse love of all things Linux. &nbsp; :lol: <br /><br />So! &nbsp;What benefits and detriments are there? &nbsp;I have read that the kernel supports 64-bit, so what makes a 64-bit distro. a, well, 64-bit distro? &nbsp;I mean, is the interface different or does it run faster or something? &nbsp;Can I still run my 32-bit apps in a 64-bit distro since the processor supports 32-bit? &nbsp;Will I encounter a lot of problems going back and forth between the two?<br /><br />Any suggestions, thoughts, etc? &nbsp;Lloydr told me that if I wanted to run Slackware-64 I'd have to compile it all from scratch, how hard would that be to do? &nbsp;I mean, would I just pop in the slack disc and tell it to compile or what? &nbsp;Or would running Mandrake, since it'll be a primarily gaming and some graphics box, be better? &nbsp;I've heard running Wine in Mandrake is pretty simple and I'm still having issues running it perfectly in Slackware (see my Baldur's Gate II posting).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">slackware discs 3 and 4 are source discs, you will find patrick volkerding's customized source build scripts that you can either leave stock or edit for optimization....those scripts will make a source based install of slack much easier &nbsp;:wink:</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would like to run a 64 bit version of linux with all the apps compiled for 64-bit as well. &nbsp;I think SuSE does that on their version but I'm not sure. &nbsp;<br /><br />There is amd64 support in the current release of FreeBSD as well, that's something I'm also looking into. &nbsp;<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">But what's the advantage of using a 64-bit distro? &nbsp;I mean, why not continue using the 32-bit? &nbsp;I'm curious as to what advantages there are as well since upgrading for upgrading's sake is a never-ending and rather moronic thing to do. &nbsp;You've got to have a purpose behind it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Excellent, that's what I was hoping for. &nbsp;Would I have to compile the 64-bit slack distro on my current Linux box and then somehow figure out how to install it on the new box, or would I compile it on the new box and install it on the new box?<br /><br />I'm not really familiar with all of that, as you can see. &nbsp;=)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">&lt;shrugs&gt; I wouldn't MIND doing it, I'd just want to know HOW to do it. &nbsp;Without having an OS installed I'd imagine it'd be mildly difficult compiling everything it needs. &nbsp;However, if it wasn't that difficult or just required some time then I'd be happy to.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm running SuSE 9.1 64 bit on an Athlon 64 bit &nbsp;machine. Here are the pros and cons.<br /><br />Contrary to previous posts, speed is the number one benefit. With the kernel compiled for 64 bit and the apps compiled for 64 bit, it flies.<br /><br />However, because the kernel, libraries, etc are all compiled for 64 bit, it's a real pain in the butt to get a 32 bit app to run on it. You usually have to recompile 32 bit apps to point to the new locations for the 32 bit libraries since they are in a different location or have a different name. (64 bit libraries and 32 bit libraries can't be located in the same directory and have the same name... :D ) Also, many 32 bit apps will not compile at all on a 64 bit system. Oh, and except for the most popular apps, it's hard to find 64 bit versions of apps right now.<br /><br />My recomendadtion is, that until 64 bit becomes more popular, go with a 32 bit version of Linux. You may sacrifice some speed because you don't have the 64 bit version of Mozilla or Firefox (Which can't work on a lot of sites because there's not a 64 bit flash plugin and other proprietary plugins) or the 64 bit version of XMMS or Evolution, but you will be able to run pretty much anything you want.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thank you for the tip. &nbsp;Oh well, bit of a shame I'll have to keep using 32-bit but I suppose it'll prep it for when it's no longer suitable for a game box (aka about three months after you buy it &nbsp;:lol: ).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just for a laugh I d/l'd the AMD64 version of Gentoo. &nbsp;We'll see how that runs, if it causes any major problems. &nbsp;I'll probably go back to running 32-bit Slack, Gentoo, or Mandrake (I always wanted to try Gentoo...heard positive things about it) but this'll be fun. &nbsp;I'll post my experience, however limited, as soon as I'm done with it.</div>
