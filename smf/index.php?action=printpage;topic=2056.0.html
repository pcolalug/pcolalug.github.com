					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just got one of these, it's the &quot;world's first laser mouse.&quot; I dunno if it's really the first but holy...this thing is amazing. &nbsp;I haven't had an oppurtunity to boot up Linux yet (kind of waiting for my sound card to come in, and I've been playing HL2 a lot) so I don't know if I'm going to need to start some major reconfiguration of my mouse from the Intellimouse I was using but [edit]DARN[/edit]!<br /><br /><br />This thing is incredible. &nbsp;It's wireless, features a lithium ion internal battery, a quick charging base station (they're not kidding. &nbsp;Less than an hour for a full charge that lasts for days of gaming EASILY and still has juice to spare). &nbsp;My main concern with wireless was delay and this it fixes with equal speed of USB hardwired. &nbsp;I was impressed by the specs but after using it ingame and around the desktop I'm shocked with it.<br /><br /><br />To be perfectly blunt, I had to put all my sensitivity settings down around half or a third of what I was using. &nbsp;To be brief, they aren't kidding when it says it's 20x more accurate than an optical. &nbsp;I BREATHE and this thing moves practically (slight, very slight, exaggeration). &nbsp;I'm still having to adjust as I'm used to using a mouse more with just my finger movements but I'm thinking about starting using a mouse with my whole arm for movement.<br /><br />It's got a lot of buttons which regardless of whether or not all of them are able to be used in Linux it's impressive. &nbsp;The only button that doesn't seem to work is the &quot;Application Switch&quot; button but that's fine, it's right in the center of a universal &quot;forward&quot; and &quot;back&quot; button set for browsers. &nbsp;The scroll wheel tilts and rolls up and down as well as pushes down AND has momentary switch buttons on top and bottom called &quot;cruise control.&quot; Essentially it's like rolling down or up but without all the &quot;roll, roll, roll,&quot; just holding down the button. &nbsp;Like using the down or up arrow on your keyboard but with the mouse.<br /><br />The feel is unreal. &nbsp;This is, by far, the most comfy mouse I've EVER used. &nbsp;EVER. &nbsp;It actually has a good-sized hump rather than being totally flat or somewhere inbetween which isn't natural for your hands. &nbsp;No, this thing is perfect.<br /><br /><br />It's also sleek and beautiful. &nbsp;Normally I'm not one for aesthetics but I'm thinking about some modding to my monitor and everything else to get it to match the simple but sleek style.<br /><br /><br />Bottom line this thing was worth every [edit]darn[/edit] penny of the $80 I got it for over at Office Depot and if you're a gamer you OWE it to yourself to get one of these.<br /><br />[moderated 2:30PM CST 12/21/2004 by Rugmonster due to profanity in body]</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">obligatory: &nbsp;I just got an optical mouse....you insensetive clod!<br /><br />seriously though, I did just get an optical mouse. &nbsp;I put it off for years, but i gota say I like it. &nbsp;I don't really get the whole, &quot;more sensitivity is better&quot; thing. &nbsp;The games I like to play online are ultra realistic, and often times I'll actually tune down the sensitivity to give me more precise aiming.<br /><br />&nbsp; For example, I often like to play sniper in America's army, just because it's such a hard thing to do well. &nbsp;I can't afford to have my crosshairs bouncing around when I really get into the game. &nbsp; Ever tried to consistantly snipe someone through a 20ft gap who's running flat out? &nbsp;Your crosshair has to be in Exactly the right position...not to mention that I 'snapshot' most of my kills.<br /><br />Another analogy, have you ever shot a high powered rifle at a target 200 yd's way? &nbsp;You quickly realise the reason why marksmen are such good shots is, more often than not they have a wieghted barrel. &nbsp;This greatly reduces the 'sensitivity' to the amount of random drift caused by heart beat and muscle activity</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I'm using it in Linux now. &nbsp;Turns out I didn't need to mod the xorg.conf or anything, it works. &nbsp;Of course, side-to-side scrolling and &quot;forward-and-back&quot; doesn't work but I didn't implement those with the other one either. &nbsp;It's cool, I'd like to use it, but I heard that especially with the forward and back buttons that if the program isn't expecting it that could turn sour real quick.<br /><br />Side-to-side scrolling I don't have in WindowsXP since I uninstalled the Logitech driver anyway. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Because it was running a program in the background and I don't like more processes running than is absolutely necessary. &nbsp;Besides, not like I had gotten used to it anyway.<br /><br /><br />I found, like you, that I had to turn my sensitivity down but after you get used to it you'll never go back. &nbsp;In CS my big issue with the ball mouse was that to get it to move just a pixel or two, just a hair for a headshot, it was freakin' impossible. &nbsp;Nevermind all the cleaning, the dragging, and everything else. &nbsp;The optical fixed that, and the laser made it SMOOTH. &nbsp;Like, REALLY smooth. &nbsp;Smoother than a fresh coat of a wax on a 60's Stingray Corvette smooth. &nbsp;It's really...unique.<br /><br /><br /><br />Oh, and congrats on the optical! &nbsp;After you start using it you'll never want to use anything less.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I know I was singing praises for my MS Wireless Desktop Elite keyboard/mouse set, but darn it if I haven't had problems with the mouse recently. It seems to hang and taking the batteries out and putting them back in or simply replacing them seems to fix the issue, but it's a pain in the butt, not to mention eating batteries now. I went over six months without replacing any batteries, but them replaced them at least twice in the last three months. In fact, I still have the batteries on my desk from the last time I replaced them.<br /><br />I have looked at the MX1000 a couple of times and the $80 retail price tag has somewhat dissuaded me. Well, enough is enough with the MS Wireless Intellimouse Explorer (http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouseandkeyboard/productdetails.aspx?pid=002) and I'm going to get me an MX1000. The cool thing is, I found it for $62 with free shipping at Newegg (http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=26-104-158&amp;depa=1). Happy day for me. Pardon me while I place my order.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay, here is what I just ordered.<br /><br />Logitech MX1000 Laser Mouse (http://www.newegg.com/app/viewProductDesc.asp?description=26-104-158&amp;catalog=23&amp;manufactory=BROWSE)<br />X-RAYPAD ZeroFriction MouseSkates (http://www.newegg.com/app/viewProductDesc.asp?description=17-114-140&amp;catalog=23&amp;manufactory=BROWSE)<br />Func Surface 1030 Black Base Mousepad (http://www.newegg.com/app/viewProductDesc.asp?description=17-114-301&amp;catalog=23&amp;manufactory=BROWSE)<br /><br />One of my gaming buddies used to swear by his Func pad, and he was one of the best FPS players I knew. I got the teflon pads for the mouse just because they were cheap and I've heard they help a lot. As always, I'll let you all know how they work out.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay, I just got done with about an hour of CS:Source and I have to say, the mouse is awesome. Also, I was able to assign all of the buttons so that I have full functionality (under Windows). A lot of people say it is heavy, but it's no heavier than my MS Wireless Intellimouse Explorer 2.0. It did take a little getting used to for how smooth it moves on the pad and I did have to tweak the sensitivity, but I was doing pretty well after I got used to it. I was pulling off some really nice head shots. I think I'll only get better with it in time. Also, other people have complained about a lag when you pick up the mouse. I haven't had that issue at all. By far, the nicest mouse I've ever had.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">yea I've also heard about people saying there is a lag when you pick it up totally off the pad out of range for the sensor to sense movement and put it back down. I've yet to notice it with mine and I've spent a good bit of time gaming with this mouse.</div>
