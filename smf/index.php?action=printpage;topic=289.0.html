					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've just purchased a new machine and want to convert my previous machine to the Linux operating system. &nbsp;I'd like to learn enough to divorce Bill and all his trappings if I can get to the point I'm comfortable with Linux. &nbsp;<br /><br />Is the club a place where I can learn what I need to do? &nbsp;Are club meetings a place where questions can be asked and anwers found? &nbsp;Is there any arrangment for hand holding for newbies like me who want to take the leap to Linus? &nbsp;<br /><br />If I've gotten to the wrong place, can anyone point me to the right place?<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Wally</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Wally,<br /><br />This is probably a good place to start. We have meetings each month at Books-A-Million on Davis. We are talking about having an &quot;Install Fest&quot; sometime early next year. That's where we get together and help newbies install Linux on their computers. I'm sure people will also bombard you with some good links for getting started with Linux. <br /><br />By registering on this forum and attending a couple of meetings, you automatically become a member. There aren't any dues or any cash that you need for the group. When we need money for something, which is very seldom, we ask for cash contributions. <br /><br />Anyway, welcome aboard. Just keep checking back here for more info.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">We welcome questions at meetings. But don't feel like you have to wait till a meeting to get help. Ask a question on the forum here and we will get you the best answer we can, or point you to where to find it. <br /><br />Welcome aboard.<br /><br />David<br />Vice President of the group</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi and welcome! We're also getting together this Saturday for a kind of geek christmas party and you're certainly welcome to attend. I'm sure someone here will be glad to answer any and all questions you may have. Have you picked a distrobution yet? Most people here use Mandrake (http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/) or Red Hat (http://www.redhat.com). For folks who've never used a Unix-like operating system, I usually recommend Lycoris (http://www.lycoris.com) (you should be up and running in about 20 minutes flat with that one). All of the above are freely available and I'm sure folks wouldn't mind bringing you a copy to the December pary or future meetings.</div>
