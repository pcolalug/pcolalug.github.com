					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey guys. I&#039;m running Drupal 4.7.3 and Gallery 2.1.2. I had no problems setting things up with Drupal. However when I tried to embed Gallery into Drupal I started running into problems. I have the Gallery module working fine in Drupal, but when I try to add a Gallery block to my Drupal page, no images appear. <br /><br />Drupal and Gallery work perfectly fine on their own. Does anyone have any idea what a possible problem may be?<br /><br />I&#039;m running Fedora Core 5 </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Have you asked the Drupal folks? You will probably have better luck with them. I&#039;ve never used Drupal or Gallery2, but possibly someone else has around here. Make sure you drop a post with both Drupal&#039;s forum/mailling list as well as Gallery2. When you start talking about web apps, the OS has less and less to do with anything.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Not really a help to the problem, but there is a pretty good Drupal podcast over at Lullabot.com (http://www.lullabot.com/). They give Drupal news and info. I have not dug around their site a whole lot, but you can probably find links to good forums and information on the problem.<br /><br />I am a phpWebsite (http://phpwebsite.appstate.edu/) user myself. So I am not sure how to answer the questions you have.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I wanted to add one thing. You haven&#039;t really described any specifics. Have you looked at your access and error logs? Tried putting any markers in the code to see where things might be breaking? If you have any hopes of getting help, you&#039;re going to need to provide a lot more information. With what you&#039;ve given us, we can&#039;t really even begin to tell you where to look.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey thanks guys, I know I didn&#039;t provide enough information on this. I am kind of new to forums and don&#039;t have much experience on posting problems. But I was ambitious enough to finally figure it out. Thanks for the Podcast dpeach! I subscribed to it... will let some of my friends that run drupal know about it. I&#039;m sure I will have more to post and will make sure to look through my logs and post those as well ;).<br /><br /></div>
