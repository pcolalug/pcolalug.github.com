					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It looks like Madiacom has blocked port 25, not sure if thats the issue with Yahoo or not. I still can not reach a few sites. So does anyone have and experience with redirecting email? I seen a coulpe sites but I was worried about giving my login / password for this service.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Wait, I&#039;m confused.<br /><br />Either mediacom is blocking a smtp server on your machine, or they&#039;re keeping you from hitting port 25 on other hosts, I can&#039;t figure out which.<br /><br />On a side note, I do remember many console email clients in linux require you to host a smtp server to send your email, which I think is absolutely rediculous.&nbsp; The only console client i&#039;ve heard that can use a pop3 or imap server remotely is pine, and I&#039;ve never got that working myself.&nbsp; Course I could be totally wrong about all this, I don&#039;t have that much experience with it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I can telnet to both servers for sending and recieving mail. But I can not access yahoo mail or the web site at all. So I tried to configure kmail with the info I found ,port #&#039;s etc and it still won&#039;t work.&nbsp; If you use another ISP it seems to be fine. I&#039;m guessing the problem involves Mediacom and smoking crack.&nbsp; </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I found a broadband forum and found some more info. Appearently Mediacom did a firmware update<br />Wednesday night. That&#039;s what screwed everyone up. They still do not know when they will have it fixed!&nbsp; Just charming!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Slow down.<br /><br />Port 25 outbound is blocked by Mediacom for various reasons and this has been the case for several years. You can use their SMTP server as a smart host, meaning you can use your local SMTP server, but set it up to forward mail through their SMTP server. If you are trying to use another SMTP server that doesn&#039;t belong to them, you won&#039;t be able to use it either. Instead, setup your POP3 or IMAP account normally, but setup SMTP to point to Mediacom&#039;s SMTP server. They will relay any domain for you as long as you are on their network.<br /><br />And like I said, they were feeding you a line of B.S. when they told you it was a Yahoo problem. If no one else in the world has problems getting to those sites, it only means there is a problem with your ISP or your system. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m somewhat confused, too......<br /><br />If you can&#039;t use Yahoo Mail, it&#039;s got nothing to do with SMTP/servers/port 25/forwarding, or anything else like that.&nbsp; Yahoo Mail is accessed with a web browser, and therefore is not related to &quot;real&quot; email at all.<br /><br />If you have a broadband account with Mediacom, you certainly do have a Mediacom email account (or maybe you never set it up, but you could).&nbsp; In my opinion, a &quot;real&quot; email account like that is FAR superior to web-based email accounts such as Hotmail, Yahoo Mail. Gmail, etc. etc....<br /><br />Once you get a Mediacom email account set up (probably done somewhere on the support section of their website, not real sure as I don&#039;t use Mediacom), you could use something like Kmail, or Evolution, or Thunderbird (my personal choice) to access your email via POP3.&nbsp; No setting up of any servers/ports/forwarding will be needed.<br /><br />Not sure why you can&#039;t access the Yahoo website, or use Yahoo Mail, but it certainly doesn&#039;t seem like something that would be caused by Mediacom.&nbsp; I can do both just fine from here, although I&#039;m on Cox Cable.&nbsp; I&#039;d suggest you clear out your browser&#039;s Cache/cookies/temp files and then try again.<br /><br />Good luck, <br />Dan<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I can not even connect to Yahoo at all or Linuxquestions.org or upload my SETI results. I have had my Yahoo account for almost 10 years. I don&#039;t want a mediacom account, but only if I can some how reach my Yahoo account through it. I found five pages of complaints about Mediacom / Yahoo problem on a broadband message board. So its a widespread problem caused by Mediacom, Now on the fourth day!<br />Last month it was my Mediacom phone that didn&#039;t work for over three weeks now this!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just don&#039;t see how it can be a Mediacom problem, if you can&#039;t connect to just those couple of sites.&nbsp; I&#039;m assuming you can browse the rest of the internet normally...?<br /><br />Did you clear out your browser as I suggested above?&nbsp; Perhaps try using an alternate browser?&nbsp; Try connecting from another computer?&nbsp; Did you do any of these things?<br /><br />Are there any other Mediacom users reading this that can try to reach Yahoo and LQ.org with a browser to confirm...?<br /><br />Doesn&#039;t make much sense to me.<br /><br />Dan<br /></div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The problem is a firmware upgrade Mediacom did to thier modems, it effected 3 models. Someone found that changing the MTU to a shorter length will allow it to work, just a little slower.<br />I now realize Yahoo is web based never paid any attention to it before, didn&#039;t care. I just scanned around the net trying to find a fix, so of course there is a lot of old or bogus info floating around. Like mail using port 25 / 110, now I know.<br />Yahoo&#039;s pop mail I heard you have to pay for it....???<br />&nbsp;I did find YoSucker app for Linux that will download mail using command line but the MTU would still be an issue anyway.<br />Yahoo, msn, gamil, x-box gamming, SETI/BOINC and some home banking sites were unaccessable for Mediacom customers.<br />Anyway setting ifconfig eth0 mtu 600 works but just for that cuurent session, so that&#039;s good enough for me!<br />Its still screwed up today, 5th day....</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you are having a problem with your MTU, then you wouldn&#039;t be getting to any sites. MTU has to do with a lower level protocol (Ethernet) than TCP/IP.&nbsp; If you had a true MTU problem, then none of your traffic would get ANYWHERE. IP and subsequently TCP and UDP all function at higher levels and have nothing to do with the MTU. They could care less about it. That is the beauty of encapsulated protocols. <br /><br />Programs such as Fetchmail and your &quot;YoSucker&quot; use POP3 and/or IMAP to download mail. This would not solve your problem with Yahoo Mail. Would you like a Gmail account? You would get free POP3 access with it.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="index.php%3Ftopic=3030.msg14901.html#msg14901">Quote from: danc on October 16, 2006, 09:56:19 pm</a></div><div class="quote">Most people find &quot;real&quot; email to be FAR superior to web-based mail.<br /></div><br />I prefer Gmail&#039;s interface, fast search capabilities and labels. I use Thunderbird now since I&#039;m hosting my mail locally, but I miss Gmail.<br /><br />Alan, I think you&#039;ve heard a lot of unrelated &quot;causes&quot; because everything you&#039;re saying makes absolutely no sense for a networking point of view. You need to contact Mediacom and play dumb. If you really want to know the problem, ask for tier 2 support. If you get any hint of hesitation or stumbling from tier 2, ask to go up higher. You may get a free month of service out of it.</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I too find web based email to be superior to regular email.<br /><br />The main reason?&nbsp; Well, when you use regular mail, you have to decide if you want to leave mail on the server when you download it, which can result in you seeing old mail as new, especially if you use a combination of regular and web-based clients.&nbsp; OTOH, you could tell the program to delete it off the server, but again, this presents problems.<br /><br />Another thing, I&#039;d love to get my email setup through a console program, but most console programs require a MTA installed to send your email.&nbsp; I&#039;m a big believer in the mantra &quot;the fewer services you have, the more secure you are.&quot;&nbsp; If graphical email clients can get by using the remote pop3 and smtp server, all clients should as well.&nbsp; I&#039;m not about to go through the hassle of setting up a mail server, just so it can route it through ANOTHER isp mail server, when you could have done that directly.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Danc...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;When Yahoo mail works I&#039;m happy when it doesn&#039;t I&#039;m not happy. I never really was too concerned how it worked, what color it was, layout,&nbsp; etc, I just didn&#039;t care, maybe I have more pressing things to worry about. If for reason I jumped up and screamed why its web based!&nbsp; sadly it still would not have worked. I tried using the command line YoSuker didn&#039;t work either, grasping at straws.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Mediacom&nbsp; has no advantages to me, none , zero, 0. I can check my Yahoo mail in any country and move anywhere and its always available, Mediacom isn&#039;t. I have had my Yahoo mail account for almost ten years. I don&#039;t want to have to go all over the web to update&nbsp; a new address, like bill payment, statements, resumes, etc. Plus if someone trys to find me even after years they can. Like if Ed McMayon was looking for me to give me a million $ he could find me.<br />&nbsp;I did tell Mediacom about changing the MTU and they shugged thier shoulders at me this morning! Sad but ture. They still no idea whats wrong and no idea when it will be fixed. I hope this make sence. Maybe I&#039;m not writting this clear and its causing confusion???? Let me know if there is still anything you don&#039;t understand.&nbsp; Later..........<br /><br /><br />Oh , I forgot, in the middle of this episode I was scrabbling to get to my mail. I was collecting references for a job interview so I was in extra spaz mode. That probably added to discombobulated posts, sort of like this one!</div>

It seems MTU issue effects only users that have the phone and interent bundle.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Mediacom didn&#039;t tell you to reset the modem?! You could be having DNS problems and it doesn&#039;t matter. They always have you reset the modem. Wow.<br /><br />If I were you, I would be moving away from Mediacom simply for their inept technical support. There are a lot of DSL options in the Pensacola/Pace/Milton area and you should be able to get good rates. The speeds won&#039;t be as fast as cable, but Mediacom sucks anyway. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">&nbsp;I read to reset the modem on a DSL web site Wednesday morning. I think there was a fix that required a reset, maybe it was downloaded on the reset??? We will probably never know. <br />&nbsp;That morning I was in Big Lots and ran into one of the Mediacom Ladies from our local office, out on lunch break. She was talking to me that they were told five different stories on what was wrong. I told her again I had found that changing the MTU got things working. She said sorry about the problem and had no idea when it will be fixed. I told her they fixed it already earlier that morning! She shook her head and walked away. Looks like the customer service people were victims too of thier own management. DOH!<br />&nbsp; I had issues with Hellsouth and was so happy to go to Mediacom. I&#039;m affraid the others may include smoke signals, strings, yelling from the roof top etc. I love the free long distance with the phone.</div>
