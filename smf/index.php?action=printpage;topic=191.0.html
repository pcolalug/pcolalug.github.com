					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I tried to order parts to upgrade my system with, but they still haven't shown up. &nbsp;Actually, I placed my order monday (oct 7) and as of Sunday (oct 13) they still haven't even shipped.<br /><br />I dunno, maybe it's in part with the west coast shipping strike that's been in the news, the company is in CA I believe. &nbsp;But this is starting to suck.<br /><br />I called their customer service line friday, I had to call back several times before someone actually answered. &nbsp;They told me that I couldn't cancel my order because the parts were already sent to their shipping department and would ship out that day. &nbsp;Well, as you can see, they didn't.<br /><br />Anyway, the company / website is www.buyxtremegear.com, they have decent prices and some good deals, but it's not worth this kind of wait. &nbsp;Stay far away if you can.<br /><br />Nick<br />imnes@go.com</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">They never shipped anything. &nbsp;I ended up filing a complaint with the Better Business Beauru and canceling my order. &nbsp;I can highly recomment Thompson's Computer Warehouse (Florida company) www.tcwo.com , their staff is very knowledgable, courteous, etc. &nbsp;Plus they have resonable shipping prices (Case, motherboard, and Ram, ~ 28 lbs cost $6.95 to ship). &nbsp;And actually, my motherboard was on backorder which delayed my shipment by 2 days, so they gave me free shipping which was nice. &nbsp;<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for the link. They seem to have pretty good prices. <br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: imnes</div><div class="quote">their staff is very knowledgable, courteous, etc.</div><br />That is a pleasant change.<br /><br />So have you gotten this stuff? Were they prompt about the shipping? Or are you still on back order?<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">As soon as the procesed my order (next business day because I placed my order around midnight), they saw my item was on back order. &nbsp;They called me to let me know about it which was nice as opposed to just letting me sit here and wonder where my stuff was. &nbsp;But everything shipped out promptly and arrived exactly as order, and working fine. &nbsp;<br /><br />Nick</div>
