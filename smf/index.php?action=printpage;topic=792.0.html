					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi, My name is Ed. I llve in Jay and work for ExxonMobil in Atmore, AL. I am 54 years old and been using linux for a couple of years but really got interested in it this year. I run Mandrake Linux 9.0 and 9.1 and like it very much. 9.1 has become my os of choice. I only use win98 because of a vb5.0 application I use and I am too new to try wine just now. I am not even sure wine supports the vb runtime libs. I plan on being at the meeting Saturday at Oscar's. Looking forward to meeting all of you there!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Howdy, Ed! If you used the ISP from EREC, I bet we have talked before. I haven't worked there for a couple of years, but there are a couple of customers that come to mind that might possibly use linux. Glad to have you and look forward to seeing you Saturday!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome, Ed!! &nbsp;I think you're right about Wine. &nbsp;I'm about the only one here with a lil Wine experience from sources other than Crossover plugin. &nbsp;I do have this nifty trick involving Windows 98 inside Linux tho... &nbsp;which reminds me... &nbsp;I need to write up that article on PC Emulation</div>
