					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">For enterprise :<br /><br />- Turbolinux (good integration with server grade ?)<br />- Debian<br />- Redhat (most popular ? but != the best ?)<br />- Redflag (this outbeat windows2k servers in China) &nbsp;:shock: <br /><br />any suggestions ? <br />(http://foolfish.chinaemu.net/iconpic/hm/hm02.gif)</div>

Redhat, because they are the standard and most server apps have RPMs built for RedHat. SuSE because their enterprise server has gotten some of the best reviews around. It is designed from the ground up in both performance and functionality.<br /><br />If you're looking for workstations, I'd consider SuSE workstation and possibly Mandrake. Mandrake, because they have been rated as one of the best &quot;desktop&quot; distros on the market. SuSE, because their workstation is designed for the corporate environment and to interact with their server product.<br /><br />This is all just my opinion, though.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'd have to second steve on SuSE, especially for enterprise desktop users. Though I don't have direct experience with the distro as a server nor any version after 8.0, the reviews are really good. emnes has been using SuSE a bit as an Oracle server, any comments, Nick?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would first have to ask what you're going to be doing, is it really 'enterprise' business requiring big machines, expensive software, and very expensive 24/7 guaranteed support?<br /><br />I'm using SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 7 where I'm working now. &nbsp;It's actually about half the price of RedHat's comparable offerings, and has great support from Dell and Oracle.<br /><br />I started with one machine, now up to 4 (each is dual p4 1.5ghz, 4gb ram, dual 75 gb RAID mirror arrays). &nbsp;They are load-balanced and clustered using combination of cisco hardware and oracle software. &nbsp;They run Oracle 9i Database and Oracle 9i Application Server. &nbsp;<br /><br />It doesn't really matter which one you choose, linux is linux. &nbsp;They'll have different tools to help you maintain the systems, but they will all function great. &nbsp;Depends on how low-level you want to get with the system (in SuSE you can't really modify config files yourself because the GUI config tools will just overwrite them). &nbsp;And also depends on how much you want to spend, last I checked I think SuSE is &lt; $1000, RedHat is in the $2000-$3000 range. &nbsp;<br /><br />If you really need enterprise support I would go with SuSE as a first choice, RedHat second, and I wouldn't consider any of the others. &nbsp;If you don't really need enterprise support than go with whatever makes you feel good, for me that's FreeBSD and Slackware at home. &nbsp;<br /><br />Oh, if you are going to be running enterprise-class applications then you will most likely be buying support contracts too, better check the support for which version of Linux they tell you to use, that might make the decision for you.<br /><br />Oh one other nod for SuSE - according to reports, SuSE (and I guess Connectiva and Turbo also) aren't threatened by the SCO vs Linux lawsuits because of their partnership on the United Linux venture, so that would be another reason to stick with SuSE.<br /><br />Good luck,<br />Nick</div>
