					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">My father is a major labor proponent. He is a supporter of buying anything Made in the USA. I never really understood that until now. Now that my chosen profession is moving jobs overseas, making it harder for people in my profession to find jobs, I too see why I should buy American made products. The economy is driven by consumers and we place our vote of support by every dollar we spend.<br /><br />So who benefits from jobs moving overseas? Not you or me, not the small business owner. The one who benefit are the very richest of the rich. In this global economy, we are going to lower the standard of living here in the states and raise the standard in other countries. Yes, we are more expensive employees, but don't we deserve to protect our standard of living? <br /><br />Why will I go out of my way for this? Because I want a job after my time in the Air Force. Will I be able to go to India or whatever country is selling labor the cheapest and maintain the same level of living that I do here? No! I probably won't even be able to get a job in one of the Asian countries because I am American. Is business fair? Hardly, but I don't have to play into their game. Americans need to show American companies that they need to employ us or we won't buy their products.<br /><br />Oh yeah, one final jab at the quality that comes out of cheap Indian IT labor...anyone dealt with Dell Tech Support lately? It's bad when two techs can barely understand each other.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">this is only the tip of the iceberg.. a small appeasement to be sure.. but great ripples are formed by a small single stone.<br /><br />Dell Moves Some Customer Service Operations Back to the U.S.<br />By LAURIE J. FLYNN<br /><br />Published: December 8, 2003<br /><br /><br />DELL'S recent decision to direct some customer service calls to help desks in the United States, rather than to its call center in Bangalore, India, shows how companies with customer support operations overseas are having to tread a fine line with their clients, some of whom are still surprised to talk to technicians on a different continent. <br /><br />To analysts and consultants, the outsourcing of technology jobs is a trend that will only grow. In Dell's case, some of its most coveted business customers complained to management that Indian technical support workers relied too heavily on scripted answers and were unable to handle more complex computer problems. While most questions phoned in by home computer users tend to be fairly straightforward - like how to update software or install a wireless adaptor - greater expertise is needed to respond to corporate network problems. <br /><br />A spokesman for Dell, Barry French, said the company was responding to concerns from business customers when it decided last month to route calls from many large business customers to American call centers, though he maintained that it would not be sending fewer calls over all to its operation in India. <br /><br />&quot;We just flipped a switch,&quot; he said, explaining that some consumer calls that had been handled by domestic call centers would now be sent to India. <br /><br />&quot;What companies are finding is that offshore can be good for generic, commodity services,&quot; said Howard Rubin, executive vice president of the Meta Group Inc., a consulting firm. &quot;Corporate customers have problems very local to their applications and very specific to their companies.&quot;<br /><br />Analysts say that along with skill considerations, some companies may be worried about criticism from labor groups and some customers who object to sending jobs overseas. Governments are under particular pressure. This year, half a dozen states are considering that workers hired under state contracts be American citizens or documented workers. <br /><br />Stephen Lane, research vice president for information technology services at the Aberdeen Group in Boston, said, &quot;There is a backlash and it's building, particularly in sectors like information technology that is still being hard hit by the economy.&quot; <br /><br />Clearly, information technology workers will face more difficulty as technology jobs move to cheaper labor markets abroad. According to a new survey by IDC, a market research company, nearly a quarter of information technology services will be sent offshore by 2007, sharply higher than the 5 percent of technology services being handled offshore this year. <br /><br />The first wave of offshore outsourcing began with the movement of customer-service call work to offices in India, Malaysia and Indonesia, but American companies are also beginning to send back-office work, like the processing of forms, abroad as well.<br /><br />While the outsourcing of technical service jobs is reminiscent of the movement of manufacturing jobs overseas in recent decades, analysts say the difference is that the change in the technology industries is occurring faster. And the jobs that are beginning to leave are considered white-collar jobs that have traditionally been protected from competition with foreign workers. <br /><br />&quot;Companies are getting more aggressive about it,&quot; said Chris Disher, an outsourcing specialist with the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton. &quot;The economies are straightforward - you get an $80,000 engineer for $12,000,&quot; he said, alluding to wages in India.<br /><br />The challenge for the United States technology companies, according to industry consultants, is to distinguish between the tasks that can be effectively handled offshore and those that cannot. Some, like Dell, have learned that they need to be sensitive to the reaction of their customers.<br /><br />&quot;In times like these, your business is attached to customer sentiment,&quot; said Atul Vashistha, chief executive of NeoIT, a California company that advises companies on outsourcing to India. &quot;It's primarily a question of market timing.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;There are truly some areas where complexities'' make sending work offshore difficult, Mr. Vashistha said. He recounted the experience of one client, a skateboard manufacturer with almost all its customers teenage boys, that found sending its support services overseas disastrous. The cultural nuances, and the constantly changing jargon of skateboarding, made it necessary for support calls to be handled by like-minded young American men. The company, which Mr. Vashistha declined to name, moved its support operations back to the United States last year.<br /><br />By contrast, Scotiabank, a Canadian company, has kept its customer service operations in Canada, using technology to keep labor costs low. Higher customer satisfaction is worth the slightly higher cost, said John Parkinson, chief technologist for the Americas region at Cap Gemini Ernst &amp; Young, a consulting business that works closely with the bank. <br /><br />Many offshore call centers are becoming more sensitive to the need to tutor workers in American customs as a crucial part of their training. Some workers in customer service jobs in Bangalore, for example, are being instructed to watch reruns of &quot;Friends&quot; to acquaint themselves with the cultural norms of American consumers, said Mr. Disher, the Booz Allen specialist. Trainees at many firms are also asked to read American newspapers and magazines, and are coached on American consumer habits. <br /><br />Still, many callers do not seem to care where the help desk is. &quot;Most of the time, they're just happy to be talking to a human,&quot; Mr. Parkinson said. &quot;The vast majority of people are indifferent to whether it's an American if they're getting good service.&quot;</div>
