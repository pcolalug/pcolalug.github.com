					Post by: <b>imnes</b> on <b>October 13, 2005, 01:20:58 pm</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ubuntu has released their latest version (Breezy Badger) 5.10 today.<br /><br />http://www.ubuntu.com/newsitems/release510<br /><br /><b>Major new features:</b><br /><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><li>Thin Client Integration: Ubuntu is the first distribution in the world to include deeply-integrated thin client technology. This allows you to deploy Ubuntu in large scale networked environments or, for example, in classrooms, with a lightweight Ubuntu image booting over the network. All Ubuntu management tools work for the thin client image as well as for the server.</li><li>OEM Installer Support&nbsp; This release of Ubuntu has special support for OEM hardware vendors. Ubuntu can be pre-installed and tested without configuring end user information. The user will be asked to complete that configuration (name, timezone and password) upon first startup.</li><li> Launchpad Integration&nbsp; Launchpad.net is the new infrastructure that Ubuntu and its derivatives use for translation, bug tracking, sharing code patches, fixes and technical support. Users of Ubuntu 5.10 can make technical support requests for any package in Ubuntu, and can help to translate their software, directly from the built-in Help menu in every desktop application.</li><li>GNOME 2.12.1</li><li>An enhanced tool for easily installing new applications (see &quot;Add Applications&quot; on the Applications menu)</li><li>Support for writing audio CDs (Serpentine)</li><li>Graphical startup process with progress bar (USplash)</li><li>Kernel support for cluster filesystems (OCFS2 and GFS)</li><li>Plone 2.1 &amp; Zope 2.8.1</li><li>PHP 5</li><li>Support for automatic storage allocation into LVM volumes</li><li>Simple NFS root setup with automatic hardware detection through initramfs-tools</li><li>Linux 2.6.12.6 with many updated drivers from third parties</li><li>Further enhancements to laptop support (hot keys, and working suspend/resume on more models) -- I&#039;ll let you know, so far SuSE is king of laptop support for my system </li><li>GCC 4.0.1</li><li>New early userspace infrastructure based on initramfs-tools</li><li>More modular X.org packaging (Not exactly sure what this one means)</li></ul><br /><br /><br />Nick<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Me and patrick installed ubuntu last week.<br /><br />Gota say, the 5.10 stable release is spot on.&nbsp; Not only does ubuntu automagically do alot of things for me, but it actually got them right (which imho is more important, and much harder to do).&nbsp; I would still use slackware as a server, but as a desktop, ubuntu&#039;s level of integration is simply unsurpassed.&nbsp; The media setup needs some tweaking, I prefer xine or mplayerover gstreamer any day, but that doesn&#039;t take long to fix.&nbsp; The biggest thing I love about ubuntu thus far is the package system.&nbsp; I can install software with a few clicks, or one line in the console, and have it *done*.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only come across a scarce few packages that I&#039;ll actually have to compile, thanks to debians huge repository.&nbsp; Now, I haven&#039;t even bothered compiling in the latest nvidia drivers, or roll my own kernel (something that I&#039;ll likely get around to eventually), but thus far, this has been the best &#039;out of the box&#039; distro I&#039;ve seen yet. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok, now for the wierd stuff.<br /><br />For some reason, last night, at about 1:30, ubuntu started up my computer.&nbsp; Ok, I went in and disabled all Wake up events in my bios.&nbsp; That should fix things right?&nbsp; Two minutes later it came on AGAIN.&nbsp; Notice, I said I disabled ALL wakeup events.&nbsp; I&#039;ve honestly never seen this before with any other distro than ubuntu.&nbsp; If this keeps up, I&#039;m gona have to fly dpeach in to exorcise my computer.&nbsp; &quot;...The power of god commands you!&quot;<br /><br />Till then, I&#039;ll be relying on the trusty power switch on my UPS.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The OS has nothing to do with powering a computer on. You may have a faulty powersupply or motherboard. Try an update to your BIOS and try some searching on google to see if others have similar issues with your particular PS or Mobo.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Riiight, ok, then tell me why this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only</span> happens with ubuntu. <br /><br />Sorry but I&#039;ve had this compy for three years now, and the only other time i&#039;ve had it do this, was when I had the ubuntu preview release installed.&nbsp; Whatever is causing this, I&#039;ve never seen it happen any where else, and I&#039;ve seen alot of wierd stuff in the shop.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you were having sudden power-offs, then I would say it could be something with a patch that Ubuntu has applied to its kernel. Once your computer turns off, the OS and all programs are dumped from memory. I call this a coincidence unless you have proof (documented by other sources) that ubuntu is the cause. Otherwise, it makes no sense.</div>
