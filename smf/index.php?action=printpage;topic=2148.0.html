					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here we go I have a massive cluster now and a shiny new laptop.<br />What I want is to use the dlink dwl-650 in my 166mhz laptop as an ad-hoc point to my cluster so I can link in from my new laptop from anywhere in the house to test scripts and so on. I am working on getting the dlink up right now and I already have a lan card already setup on the sane switch as the cluster. I want the Laptop to be the gateway. Any thoughts.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">well this is going to much more difficult than first thought.<br />I have the laptop running redhat 7.2 with 2.4.18-4 kernel with source.<br />Card is D-link dwl-650 rev j3 apparently running the prism2 chipset.<br />found 2 diiffrent ways to go {1] the linux-wlan-ng driver or {2] adac driver<br />both have ups and downs.....Stilll can not get the card to compile.<br />Question I have can I installl 2.6 kernel in such old equipment.<br />Since the OpenMosix 2.6 kernel is out I could upgrade. Most systems are 133-166 mhz systems with 32 megs of ram.<br />The D-link card works well with the 2.6 kernel.<br />A lot of you are probaly wondering why go thru all this.<br />Well there is a lot of advantages to card to card ad-hoc over card to router ad-hoc<br />Increased range<br />tighter security<br />better bandwidth<br /><br />down side you are seeing it, been working on this all last week and this weekend.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just an update!<br />Got the Ad-hoc network going. Could not get my dwl-650 up and running prperly, But when I was over at Mr. harolds trying to help him he had a dwl-520 that uses the realtek 8180 driver which is already there for the 2.4.18-4 kerenl just a simple insmod -f rtl18180_24x.o and what do you know no compiling or anything. Now have control of my OpenMosix cluster froom the comfort of my couch.<br />This has been a very interesting project with me learning alot about kernel modules and wireless devices. <br />Project complete.</div>
