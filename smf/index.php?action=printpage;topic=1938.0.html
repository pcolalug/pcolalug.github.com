					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've got an nForce3 250 motherboard that seems, as far as I know, to work okay in Linux. &nbsp;Should I download and attempt to use the &quot;official&quot; latest nForce chipset drivers from nVidia? &nbsp;I don't use the onboard sound at all (I've got a Santa Cruz soundcard) but I'm wondering if it would increase my performance at all. &nbsp;This wasn't the kind of thing I really knew how to google as it's more of an opinion, sorry if it sounds obvious. &nbsp;I'm just used to isntalling all kinds of drivers from Windows, don't know if it would really do anything here.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">wish i had gotten a mobo w an nforce chipset, instead of this dang blasted via crap. &nbsp;Via says that they have linux drivers for their hardware, but they leave much to be disired. &nbsp;I ended up disabling embedded sound and networking and buying a real &nbsp;sound and nic card.<br /><br />For future reference, does anyone know of a decent mobo manufacturer that makes a mobo with the latest features (pci-x) &nbsp;(8x agp) etc but sans anything embedded? (sound, networking, video)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">WITHOUT anything embedded? &nbsp;No, not anymore. &nbsp;I mean, personally I like having my ethernet embedded, but I'm not aware of anything without all that that's &quot;latest.&quot; Personally I'm having great luck so far with this Chaintech, awesome performance, too.<br /><br /><br /><br />You mentioned that I might need the driver for some other stuff on the board like built-on sound and so forth, but here's the odd thing: &nbsp;I've already got my sound card (Turtle Beach) working (though there's some to be desired of course, more on that later), my ethernet works fine, and my FX5700 seems to be working, too. &nbsp;So I guess I'm now into the idea of, &quot;why install the drivers if everything seems to be working?&quot; I'd hate to break it.<br /><br /><br /><br />Currently though I'm still hating having to run windows most of the uptime on the box to play my games. &nbsp;I HATE running Windows now that I've gotten used to using Linux. &nbsp;I've just got to get a handle on this Wine and WineX stuff, screw 5 less fps.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Been a while since I've been in the forums.... FYI If you're running ANY 2.6 kernel, don't use the latest drivers. &nbsp;There seems to be some compatibility issues with the 2 items. &nbsp;I've spammed various Linux Help and nvidia forums and no one has answered thus far. &nbsp;There were also quite a few issues with the 2.6 kernel and the new nvidia display drivers too. &nbsp;If anyone comes across the fix, PLEASE LET ME KNOW!!!</div>
