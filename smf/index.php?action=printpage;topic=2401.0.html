					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">tar -xzvf is just decompressing and unpackaging the archive. Go into the newly created directory and look for a README or INSTALL file for further instructions. Usually, to compile, it goes something along the lines of ./configure (and some options), then make and then (as root) make install, but consult the documentation for specific compile options.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Actually, If you don't have it you should just visit the site that it gave you in ./configure output. <br /><br />Four simple steps to compiling software:<br /><br />tar -xzf foo.tar.gz or tar -xjf bar.tar.bz2<br />./configure (setting up compile options)<br />make (actual compiling)<br />make install (putting everything in it's nessesary place)<br /><br />Of course from time to time you run across packages that may need other packages to build correctly, but fortunately this is rare in slackware.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you don't have a prereq installed, you don't have a prereq installed. It doesn't matter what distro you are running. Granted, Slackware doesn't leave out the -dev packages needed to compile things from source, but it's sort of silly saying that Slackware has less problems than others. It all depends on what you are trying to compile and what that needs.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">So you install curl? Did you compile it from source and install it? What steps have you taken so far and where are you at? If you have successfully compiled and installed the program you started out to install, more than likely, it was installed in /usr/local/bin. You should be able to open up a terminal and type whatever the name of the program is. Look in /usr/local/bin to see if it is there.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Try <div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">whereis amule</div> It should give you the executable, the library, and the man page path for amule. Or, if you just want the executable, just do <div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">which amule</div><br /><br />Normally, if you install an app yourself, it goes into /usr/local. You can prepend the installation path if ou want it to go into /usr/bin or /bin. Some distros even put your installed apps into /opt, if you do not tell it otherwise.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Patrick,<br /><br />I really hope you've read over those README and INSTALL files that came with the packages you're trying to install. &nbsp;Remember, I told you that sometimes certain packages will do things differently, but they will ALWAYS tell you exactly what to do in the INSTALL or README files.<br /><br />Those files are there, and they're fully capitalized (unusual in linux) for the sole purpose of telling the user how to install it.<br /><br />To read those files, go to your console, and type:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">less filename</div><br /><br />Heck you can even view them through your web browser if you want too.<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"> firefox filename</div></div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">whereis and which will only work if the program is installed in somewhere in his path. What I think is that his compile failed and did not install anything. <br /><br />What you should do is go into the directory that you built the source and look for an executable, amule. Remember that the command line is case sensitive, so you may have to type it in aMule or something like that. <br /><br />Have you looked for a Slackware package of this program?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">One of the nice things is that when you get all of the prerequisit programs for amule, then you have that many more prereqs for future programs you install.<br /><br />With packages from linuxpackages.net you don't have to untar them. Just navigate to the directory where you downloaded the file then get root privileges and type: <div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">installpkg amule*</div><br />That should be it for that. I have just downloaded it and installed it using these instructions. I then exited from being root and ran the program by typing &quot;amule&quot; without the quotes. I got this error:<div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">amule: error while loading shared libraries: libwx_gtk2_xrc-2.5.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory</div><br />So now I go in search of what that file is. I find out that it has something to do with wxBase and wxGTK (found this information on LinuxPackages). So, I downloaded the files and navigated to the directory in a console. su'd to root. Then typed:<div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">insallpkg wx*</div><br />After those two installed, I tried typing amule again. Same error (not surprised, I need to reinstall it). So I type:<div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">removepkg amule</div><br />After it is done, I install it again. Then I get the same error over.<br /><br />Hmph! All of that was typed to show you how easy it is, and then it goes and doesn't work for me. Any thoughts someone?<br /><br />I look and find that there are several similar libs installed in /usr/lib/. So I did the symlink thing and linked to the most recent version of the same file. Then I followed a whole string of those linking away. Then in the end I get this error:<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">amule: /usr/lib/libwx_base_net-2.5.so.3: version `WX_2.5' not found (required by amule)<br />amule: /usr/lib/libwx_base-2.5.so.3: version `WX_2.5' not found (required by amule)<br />amule: /usr/lib/libwx_gtk2_core-2.5.so.3: version `WX_2.5' not found (required by amule)</div><br />So there is more to it. <br /><br />Patrick, this is not normal. Someone here can help you out...eventually. You just have to stay with it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Slackware has Swaret and Apt available for package management. They will handle all of your updates and installing new software, taking care of dependencies for you. Perhaps one of the Slackware folks will tell you how to get one of those setup. That, or you can use a distro that already has a good package manager setup for you.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok, I tried it with slapt-get (the normal way I install things) and swaret. Swaret did not have it available. slapt-get, got it, but I had the same problems. I even uninstalled the wx packages and amule. Then reinstalled amule from slap-get. That should have taken care of any dependencies. Did not work. Same problem.<br /><br />I would venture to say something is wrong with that amule build. At least for me. Not that I really care about amule, I was just trying to be helpful in getting it running for Patrick.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I took a look at the wx packages on linuxpackages.net, there are several version of them. &nbsp; This one looks closest to what you need, so download and install it http://www.linuxpackages.net/download.php?id=6231<br /><br />It still won't work correctly because the library your amule package wants is called libwx_gtk2_xrc-2.5 and the one in the package is slightly different: libwx_gtk2u_xrc-2.5. &nbsp;But this will be the right version (2.5).<br /><br />I have a feeling making a link to the expected filename will work with this, so after installing that package, type these commands as root:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">cd /usr/lib<br />ln -s libwx_gtk2u_xrc-2.5.so.4.0.0 libwx_gtk2_xrc-2.5.so.3<br />ldconfig</div><br /><br />That will create a link to the library you installed with the name that amule is expecting. &nbsp;<br /><br />Now install your amule package and try to run it. &nbsp;The above steps *may* need to be done again for any of the other wx libraries that are named wrong (look in /usr/lib/libwx_*u* for other possibilities) if amule is looking for more.<br /><br />I'm at work right now and can't test this out, could some other slack user (dpeach) give it a shot?<br /><br />Nick</div>
