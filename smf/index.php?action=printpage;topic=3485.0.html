					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello the group:)<br /><br />I live in Milton, Florida. I&#039;m a 47 YO granny geek. And errr, I don&#039;t know the first thing about Linux. I&#039;m fairly proficient navigating in several of Window&#039;s operating systems. I usually do my own troubleshooting, research the problems,&nbsp; and then do my own repairs. I learned all this stuff through a whole lot of research, reading, and trial and error! But I can yell real loud for help when I need it, and I&#039;m not afraid to do it, LOL.<br /><br />I just tried to update a two year old Vista machine that I haven&#039;t used for a year or so, because I hate Vista so much.&nbsp; Yeah, I know but I did my homework first. I did some reading and research. I tried to download the SSU patches before I did anything else. But the Microsoft site informed me my system didn&#039;t need the SSU patches, and refused to install them on the system. Sigh. It&#039;s an Acer AMD 64 machine. And sure enough, after I downloaded the updates and tried to install them. I got caught in a never ending reboot cycle, and I can&#039;t even get the darn thing to boot into safe mode. Grrrr. I&#039;ve got a system I spent nearly 1,000.00 on playing the role of an expensive paper weight.<br /><br />So.... now that I&#039;m thoroughly PO&#039;d with Micro_____________ (you fill in the blank with your favorite&nbsp; expletive).&nbsp; I have several options with this machine. I can use the restore disc, and wait for Windows 7. I can buy a copy of Windows XP, reformat the disc and load it up. Or I can try out Ubuntu, which I&#039;ve been curious about for a while now.<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking Ubuntu is probably the easiest/simplest way for me to get my toes wet in a Linux OS, from what I&#039;ve read,&nbsp; without being overwhelmed with too much new stuff.<br /><br />I&#039;m just not sure how to go about loading it on my machine, or what to expect. Or if I need to hunt down drivers and all that jazz for it to work properly with my hardware. I figure with just 2 Gigs of memory, this box should fly with Ubuntu loaded on it.<br /><br />Suggestions please?<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well first of all welcome to our little piece of the Internet.<br /><br />And you are correct Ubuntu would be a great choice and it should find everything without too much work.<br />You should be up and running in around 15 minutes and yes it should fly pretty good.<br /><br />Give us a shout if you have any problems</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi GeekWeek,<br /><br />I live in Pace and can probably help you out installing Linux.&nbsp; Really, in most cases you just stick the CD in, click, click, click, and in 15 minutes or so, you&#039;re done.&nbsp; If you need help, just let us know.&nbsp; I already have various Linux CD&#039;s if you don&#039;t want to fool with downloading the iso.&nbsp; My recommendations for a Linux beginner would be Linux Mint, Simply Mepis, or Ubuntu, but there are plenty of other good choices too.<br /><br />Welcome to the lug and leave the dark side behind!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just realized that I don&#039;t have any 64 bit Linux CD&#039;s, which is probably what you need.&nbsp; If you are unable to download and burn the CD yourself, let me know and I will burn one for you.&nbsp; Also, fair warning if you do it yourself, make sure your CD burning software is capable of creating an iso file.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome to the group. As previously stated, if you have questions, just ask.<br /><br />If things get completely out of control and you can&#039;t even get the machine up enough to post a question, bring it to the next meeting and we will get you running. I bring my notebook to each meeting asking someone to help me with something I have recently broken.<br /><br />And I also think Ubuntu is a great choice. I have not run Linux Mint, but I hear it is great too.</div>
