					Title: <b>Comparison of XFS, JFS, ReiserFS and EXT3</b><br />
					Post by: <b>rugmonster</b> on <b>April 22, 2006, 10:27:18 am</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I found a recent benchmark (http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/388) of the top four Linux filesystems, XFS, JFS, ReiserFS and EXT3, at Debian-Administrator.org. Their conclusion is that XFS is the best overall filesystem for a home or small-business file server.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * It uses the maximum capacity of your server hard disk(s)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * It is the quickest FS to create, mount and unmount<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * It is the quickest FS for operations on large files (&gt;500Mb)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * This FS gets a good second place for operations on a large number of small to moderate-size files and directories<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * It constitutes a good CPU vs time compromise for large directory listing or file search<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * It is not the least CPU demanding FS but its use of system ressources is quite acceptable for older generation hardware<br /><br />What is your experience with these or other filesystems? I personally use EXT3 for my root, boot and main storage partitions (mostly media files). I then use Reiser3 for usr, var, tmp, opt and home since it has always been touted as been best for small files. This article suggests otherwise, though.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I use XFS.&nbsp; I have alot of movies and mp3&#039;s floating around, and XFS *does* handle them faster than other file systems.<br />Overall, XFS and rieser feel pretty equal.&nbsp; XFS mounts faster, and handles bigger files better, but otherwise there is little difference.<br /><br />Those of you who use multiple partitions, or obscess about your pc booting in 20 seconds (like me&nbsp; ::)) might find it useful.<br /><br />As for EXT3, It feels painfully slow to me, but it is easy to recover data.&nbsp; If I was hosting a server with priceless data, I&#039;d go EXT3 all the way...BUT, if you&#039;re relying soley on your file system to recover data and excluding golden rules like daily backups, raid, etc...your data must not be that important.&nbsp; <br /><br />For a home desktop, imho your better off going with a faster alternative.&nbsp; <br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve got a single XFS partition, the rest is ReiserFS.&nbsp; The XFS houses my qemu images (files weighing in at gigs and gigs apiece,) and runs really well.&nbsp; The ReiserFS works really well on the /usr/portage stuff, but NWN actually has/had issues with ReiserFS, you had to mount the partitions with a special option to make the game load faster than 2-3 minutes!<br /><br />As for ext3, it is tried and true, I use ext2 for /boot, never gets mounted anyways.&nbsp; I have the same opinion on using a filesystem solely on the idea that you can recover data easier.&nbsp; If it&#039;s important, back it up!<br /><br />Ian</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yes, I&#039;ve seen those benchmarks.&nbsp; The author did *so* many tests on *so* many factors, any benchmark wide conclusions aren&#039;t very reliable in my opinion.<br /><br />Fact:&nbsp; EXT3 isn&#039;t known for speed.&nbsp; It&#039;s known for backwards compatibility and the ease of data recovery.<br /><br />Don&#039;t believe me?&nbsp; Go ask some of the groups on usenet.&nbsp; EXT3 has a universal reputation of being slower than EXT2, XFS, JFS, and even rieser, however, many of the folks that are professional linux admins prefer it, simply because it&#039;s easier to recover.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve seen other benchmarks that support EXT3 spanking reiser than the one dan posted lol they all are rather amusing. <br /><br />I simply prefer EXT3 due to the fact that it&#039;s tried and true and a rather responsive FS compared to my tests with reiser and xfs ;)</div>
