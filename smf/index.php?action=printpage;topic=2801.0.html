					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">There&#039;s been news lately about Google censoring content for the government in China, but what about right here in the US?<br /><br />http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4258374615945369026&amp;q<br /><br />(Found in an entry on planet.gnome.org)<br /><br />Nick<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I dunno.&nbsp; It seems like this should bother me, but it really doesn&#039;t seem to.&nbsp; I mean, Google is a company that runs a service (for free to users like me), and they can do it any way they like, IMHO.&nbsp; If I am serious about searching for something on the internet that Google chooses to filter, there are other ways to look.&nbsp; Basically I think they have a right to run their service in any way they choose.&nbsp; This is America, after all...&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />Dan<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I agree with danc on this. If they don&#039;t give me all the results, that is their decision. At what point do we require that a company provide us every bit of information they have. Especially since we pay nothing for this service.<br /><br />Maybe they are holding results back for some premium service. hmmm.<br /><br />Of course, if enough people think this is a bad thing, then people move on to something they consider better.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It&#039;s one thing not to withhold content, it&#039;s a completely different thing when the company is withholding it based on the country of origin due to pressures from the country of origin&#039;s government when it&#039;s available to those outside that country. That&#039;s censorship and censorship is a bad thing in my mind. Yes, there are certain things which must be protected for national security reasons, but when you start applying censorship to content that is available to people outside of the nation, then you&#039;re crossing the line of infringing on freedom of information. This doesn&#039;t appear to be a situation of a corporate entity protecting secrets, national security or gear itself up for &quot;premium content&quot;. Here is what the link says:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: Google</div><div class="quote">We&#039;re sorry, but the provider of this video has not authorized Google to display this video in your location.</div><br />That&#039;s censored due to location, being the States.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If someone asks you to provide nude pictures of your wife and you don&#039;t provide them, then that is censorship, and therefore a bad thing. Am I following the thinking correctly here? Maybe those pictures were taken because of a medical condition that a Dr. needs to see. You are making the pictures available, but not to me. You have censored the information. &quot;Information wants to be free&quot; they say.<br /><br />What if you give those pictures to a courier to deliver to the Dr. and I stop the courier and tell him that he must show me the pics. Is it wrong that he does not?<br /><br />I love the freedoms we have in the US. But to think that we have a right to every bit of information that might be available is a bit rediculous.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That&#039;s a great way to kill an argument. Take it to an extreme that doesn&#039;t apply...&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />The big issue here is that Google has decided it would be best if they lay down and give in to the censorship that the Chinese government wanted. The Chinese government wants to keep the Chinese people as ignorant of the freedom they are being denied and wants to sheild them from knowing anything about labor rights, voting rights and democracy in general. Should those people be denied access to such things so that their government can continue to make money, and lots of it, on their backs and through their ignorance? <br /><br />These are things we are against in America. Freedom of information is something that people have fought long and hard for. How can we make informed decisions about electing our governmental representatives when those in power are limiting what we know? This mindset that so many people have that questioning our government, one that should be a reprentative of our wishes, is wrong and bad for the country is absurd. It is our responsibility as good citizens of this reprentative democracy to be informed and to speak up when our government is doing something we don&#039;t like. If our government is putting pressure on non-governmental entities to withhold information from the American people to save face and there is no valid national security interest involved, then that goes against the First Amendment and the United Nation&#039;s Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Our government is just that, <b>our government</b>, for the people and by the people. We cannot blindly follow and accept that all the politicians are doing what&#039;s best for us when it has been shown time and time again that they are human, can error and certainly can be enticed by the lure of money and power, something you or I have little to give. That is, unless the majority come together, act as a unified voice and tell <b>our government</b> what <b>we</b> want. But then again, if they keep us from knowing what <b>our government</b> is doing, then we can&#039;t tell them to do anything different.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">So do we just overlook it now when they do it for China and hope that if our government makes Google a really nice offer that they will not do it to us? Even if there are other ways to get to the information, Google is one of the most used. And the more reliable sources you can find on something, the better informed your decision should be. Censorship can be a very slippery slope.</div>

But Google is not there to run the country, they are there to sell a product. Google is providing a wonderful service to the people of China. No, you cannot have every ingredient on your &quot;google pizza&quot; that is available here in the US, but at least you can get a taste of what is out there. That has not been available in the past.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="index.php%3Ftopic=2801.msg13973.html#msg13973">Quote from: geekforGod on February 26, 2006, 01:04:20 pm</a></div><div class="quote">So do we just overlook it now when they do it for China and hope that if our government makes Google a really nice offer that they will not do it to us?</div><br />Who is to say they already aren&#039;t doing this.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Even if there are other ways to get to the information, Google is one of the most used. ... Censorship can be a very slippery slope.</div><br />Yes, it can be a very slippery slope. But at least Google is moving the direction to make some information available.<br /><br />There is a car here in Mexico that gets 74 MPG. When imported into the US (next year is the plan), it is expected that it will only get around 50 MPG. This is because of all the emissions controls that the tree huggers have made our government put in place. So now you lose 24 MPG because you are trying to have cleaner emissions. The choice is import the car at a lower MPG rating, or don&#039;t import the car. Of course those who make the car don&#039;t care if they lose the MPG as long as they can open up their car to potentially hundreds of thousands of new car sales. In the US people will buy it because it gets them approximately 15 MPG further down the road. Or the company can walk away because they are not allowed to provide their car as is.<br /><br />I see this as where Google is. They can take their marbles and go home and not provide any of their services, or they can see the potential to at least get their product on hundreds of thousands, if not several millions of computers. Money in their pocket. They are not breaking any laws to provide this limited service.<br /><br />Google sells advertising. They do that by sticking an ad on a search result. If they do not give you, a US citizen, all the information that they could, do you think they care? Nope, they just want to make sure that advertising gets in front of your face.<br /><br />What the Chinese government is doing, is wrong. Plain and simple. What Google is doing is business.<br /><br />If we want to change the Chinese government, then lets go to war and overthrow them. Google&#039;s presence there does not change anything in the government. What it does do, theoretically, is generate a stronger economy in the tech industry. I think all of us here could appreciate that.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Chinese censorship isn&#039;t that big of a deal to me, but the trade defecit is.<br /><br />We import just about *everything* from china, and what do we export?&nbsp; Mostly, raw materials.<br /><br />The current administration is completely ignoring the fact that china puts huge tarrifs on products from western nations.&nbsp; If anything warrented punishment, this does.&nbsp; Heck, with any other nation we would have issued trade sanctions by now, but walmart and the like are making some rather tidy profits from it, and the average american consumer saves a few bucks on consumer goods.&nbsp; The question is it worth loosing a large percentage of american manufacturing jobs?&nbsp; It would be one thing if we lost manufacturing jobs due to <i>fair</i> trade, but this is far from fair...</div>
