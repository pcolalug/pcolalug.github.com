					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Long story short, I cannot run Knoppix or the derived LiveCDs. &nbsp;I don't know why, but they don't seem to run on any system I put them on. &nbsp;It gets to the probing for ide-scsi (about two lines) and hangs. &nbsp;What am I doing wrong?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don't know what you're doing wrong. &nbsp;Check the help functions available at bootup, and see if there are some kernel options you could pass to help. &nbsp;Things like &quot;noacpi&quot;, &quot;noapic&quot;, &quot;noloapic&quot;, &quot;noscsi&quot;, &quot;nousb&quot;...<br /><br />Very strange indeed.<br /><br />Will you be coming to the LAN Party? &nbsp;If so, please bring this intriguing system with you, and we'll see if we can fix her up. &nbsp;Ever seen the TV show &quot;Overhaulin&quot; ? &nbsp; :lol: <br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">On a lot of the livecd's, they supply a 2.4 and 2.6 kernel. By default, they usually run on the 2.4 kernel. 2.6 did away with ide-scsi, so see if you can find in the boot option to try the 2.6 kernel instead. Best of luck!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Those are definitely some ideas, I'll see what I can do.<br /><br /><br />When is the LAN party (I have a feeling it's on the front page)? &nbsp;Depending on that I &quot;might&quot; be able to bring some stuff over to it but my wife is going back to the sandbox next month so I'm trying to spend as much time as I can with her. &nbsp;Heh, humorously once she's over there I'll have all KINDS of free time. &nbsp; :lol: <br /><br />Also, depending on the time, I might be messing with my new TV. &nbsp;I've never had anything that big entertainment wise in my house and I don't know if I'll be able to pull myself away from it. &nbsp;But I'll see what I can do. &nbsp;;)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That depends, the TV I have a feeling will sneak up on me. &nbsp;Like, I'll be trying to sneak out of my living room but it'll be there! &nbsp;Watching me! &nbsp;Seeing me go!<br /><br />But really, we'll see. &nbsp;Nothing about my schedule is static anymore unfortunately so I can never say for certain, but I can try.</div>
