					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This article &nbsp;(http://desktops.linux.com/article.pl?sid=04/04/13/0425202)does a good job of reviewing the next version of SuSE Linux. I can't wait for it to come out and am actually considering dropping my 4 year investment in Mandrake and switching to SuSE. <br /><br />From what I've experienced with 9.0 and am reading about 9.1, SuSE just seems like it's a more professional looking distro. Some people refer to it as commercialized but it seems to be more mature than what I've experienced with Mandrake.<br /><br />Do we have any SuSE advocates in the group?<br /><br />Steve</div>

Does it have problems with something that I'm not aware of?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I run SuSE, and Sun's linux which is based on SuSE. &nbsp;I like them both.<br /><br />Here's my SuSE 9 desktop (http://www.homeweb.org/~imnes/linux/suse/screens/suse9.0-001.jpg).<br /><br />Here's my Sun desktop (http://www.homeweb.org/~imnes/linux/sunjavadesktopsystem/screens/jds_001.png). &nbsp;Running the java media player (nice how java apps take on the gnome theme, not all of them do it though I think only the ones compiled with java sdk 1.4). &nbsp;<br /><br />Nick</div>

I think I'm actually going to buy that one and install it on my main machine. It'll be so long to Mandrake for a while. What are differences between the personal edition and the professional edition? SuSE used to have a page a long time ago listing what's included in Professional that's not in personal, but I can't find it anymore. Are there any commercial apps in professional that aren't in personal?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Not sure, at work we have SuSE Enterprise Server 7, and SuSE Pro 8 I think, but at home I just use the free FTP install. &nbsp;<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Steve,<br />I have been running suse 9 professional on my laptop for about 6 months now. &nbsp;I think I like it better than mandrake. &nbsp;I had fooled around with mandrake on my desktop since mandrake 7.0. &nbsp;I started running suse because of the toshiba &nbsp;laptop support pretty much built in. &nbsp;I have messed with it enought to know that I prefer it over mandrake and &nbsp;that I am really looking forward to the 9.1 release in May. &nbsp;I will purchase it on the spot. Here is the link for the comparison of personal to professional. &nbsp;http://www.suse.com/us/private/products/suse_linux/i386/pers_prof.html</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">From what I've seen, the only differencec between Pro and Personal edition is all GPL that can be downloaded. I think I'll go with the Personal edition.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Steve</div>
