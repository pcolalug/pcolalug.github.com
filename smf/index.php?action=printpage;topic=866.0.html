					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This is a tutorial I'm working on (it is still a work-in-progress) for getting oracle installed on SuSE on a Dell PowerEdge server. &nbsp;Most of the information is specific to those three products working together, so this probably won't be of much use to most of you. &nbsp;I'm posting it here because I know our site gets indexed by Google and someone else on the web will probably need this info!<br /><br />If you look it over and notice errors, typos, hard-to-understand spots, let me know please.<br /><br />It's HTML, can be viewed / printed at:<br />http://www.students.uwf.edu/nes3/gouge/oracle-on-suse/<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Nicely done, Nick! I wonder, though, why you had to use an older SuSE.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">They bought it a while ago (probably over a year ago) and never had anybody to install it, so it's just what they had on hand. &nbsp;And I don't think SuSE Enterpirse 8 has been certified for Oracle, so that would cause a problem with their support contracts.<br /><br />I would have rather used RedHat personally since I've had some experience with it. &nbsp;Unfortunately it cost about 4x as much as SuSE. &nbsp;Oh well...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">After installing 9ias you have to manually start your services and make a boot script to start them on reboot. &nbsp;You can read all about it in the official documentation, or better yet, run it under a support distribution and open a TAR with oracle. &nbsp;Good luck.<br /><br />Nick</div>
