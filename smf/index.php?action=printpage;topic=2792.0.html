					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey there.<br /><br />Does anyone have a recommendation for a local provider of audio (cassette) and video (vhs) to digital conversion services? As in, convert the analog output to digital, then convert that .mp3 or whatever to an au file that can be played back in a standard audio cd player. For the VHS, would want to convert the analog to DVD format.<br /><br />Thanks in advance for any and all suggestions!<br /><br />m</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Why not do this yourself? With a sound card and a male-to-male 1/8th&quot; jack audio cable, you can capture audio and then it is trivial to convert said audio to mp3 or any other audio format. Video is simple as well utilizing any video capture card. Hauppauge makes some great MPEG-2 hardware encoder cards that work superbly in Linux. You can pick up a PVR-150 for less than $100 online.<br /><br />Using all F/OSS tools, you can create DVD video discs with menus and the works.<br /><br />If I remember correctly, Brent bought my PVR-150 and I&#039;m sure he has a sound card. If you are really itching to pay someone, I&#039;m sure he would take some cash to convert your stuff&nbsp; :P</div>

Rather send them to someone who they can pay to do the job. :)&nbsp; Thanks for the heads up!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I used to work for a company called Camera America there in town. Now it is Ritz Camera. We did film to VHS (back in the day). You may check with a place like that for the video conversion. Not sure about the audio work.</div>
