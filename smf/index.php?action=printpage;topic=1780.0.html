					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello!<br /><br />Just want to make a quick post to introduce myself. &nbsp;<br /><br />My wife and I will be leaving California and moving to the Pensacola Area by mid August. &nbsp;I'm looking forward to seeing what's going on in the area as far as Linux and Open Source goes.<br /><br />I would have to describe myself as a late comer to PC's. Except for a Tandy TRS80 that my family bought way back in 1983, I hadn't used computers until I bought my first PC in 1998. My interest in computers started out in the Marine Corps where I fixed F/A-18 armament and navigational control computers.<br /><br />After getting my first PC, I started getting curious, and I've never stopped trying to learn since then. Since that day not long ago, starting out as a fledgling, not knowing what I was doing, I now have several computer certifications. &nbsp;Unfortunately, they are all Microsoft... lol<br /><br />I've been using Linux since about 1999 or 2000. My first experience was with Debian 1.3. I had just gotten my first cable modem and a friend of mine showed me how one of my junk computers that was laying around gathering dust could be put to work as a firewall/router. Since then, my interest sparked and now, after 4 years I've still only begun to see just a little of the potential that Linux has. The proverbial tip of the iceberg.<br /><br />Since then, I've used Debian, Red Hat, Mandrake, SuSe, IPCop (a Firewall distro,) Gentoo and Knoppix.<br /><br />My personal favorite distro would have to be Knoppix. I've found a use for it in so may applications, from data recovery to testing bad computer diagnosis's. Of all the distros I've installed, I use Gentoo on all of my computers except my firewall. <br /><br />I'm currently the secretary for the Fresno Open Source User's Group. &nbsp;[Brief history] FOSUG is a break off of the FresnoLUG, we broke away at the beginning of this year due to lack of organization and effort of those in charge, last minute canceled meetings, presentation givers not showing up, etc. &nbsp;Since then, Fresno LUG seems to have desolved away. [/Brief history]<br /><br />Besides serving as Secretary, I've been teaching a Beginner's Linux class at the beginning of our meetings. &nbsp;Through the hard work of the officers of the group, we’ve established regular monthly meetings with informative topics. &nbsp;Our numbers went from a small handful of 4 to 6 people meeting each month to an all time high of 34 attendees.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welome to the Sunshine State!<br /><br />Moved back here full time about 6 mos ago, after being gone 12 yrs.<br />I lived in the Bay Area 5 years prior to the move. There will be alot of changes, but change is GOOD! :) The reduction in stress level has done wonders for my health and sanity. I'm starting to feel human again.<br /><br />What prompted the move, if I may be so bold? <br /><br />Respectfully,<br /><br />ms</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hmm... What prompted the move?<br /><br />Well, I just got laid off from my 3rd job in a row... &nbsp;Seems each time I've started getting ahead, something like losing my job happens out here.</div>

What prompted the move?<br /><br />Well, I just got laid off from my 3rd job in a row... &nbsp;Seems each time I've started getting ahead, something like losing my job happens out here.</div><br /><br />Understood! &nbsp;A nice thing about Pensacola vs. San Francisco, is that the cost-of-living is soooo much less. I get a really nice two bedroom/2 bath condo here on Scenic Hwy, for LESS than what it cost me to rent a ROOM in Palo Alto. :)<br /><br />Another lively Pensacola community to check out is www.dream-pensacola.com . They are a diverse crowd of local digerati, whose underlying connection is electronic music. Not sure what your employment situation will be, but there are some folks who work in IT operations, system integration, w. Citigroup, Bearing Point, &amp; other local companies in the area over there. That seems to be where the mid 20's/30's newcomers to the area like to introduce themselves. (DP also covers the Gulf Coast nightlife). Another nice thing about DP, is that alot of people on there are former Pensacolians who now live in New Orleans, Atlanta, Panama City Beach, Orlando, and even overseas, so you get a nice variety of perspectives on a wide range of topics.<br /><br />Again, welcome to the Pensacola Bay Area!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Man...<br /><br />I've been in Pensacola since Sept, a week before Hurricane Ivan hit and since then I've been hoping to make it to &nbsp;a meeting! &nbsp;Every month so far, something has come up that has made it impossible to attend.<br /><br />Either my car broke down, or work or family, or a really big wind storm kept me from going.<br /><br />I hope to make it to a meeting soon, hopefully next month!<br /><br />Keith<br />aka Drac0</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Good to have you back. If you need a ride to a meeting don't be shy to post the need here in the forum. Someone can probably give you a lift.</div>
