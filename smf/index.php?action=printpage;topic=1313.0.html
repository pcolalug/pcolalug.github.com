					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It was kind of nice when Microsoft ignored linux. &nbsp;Now they're taking it head-on. &nbsp;Almost every single Linux site I frequent lately has had ad space bought by Microsoft. &nbsp;Today I followed a link from http://www.justlinux.com directly to http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/facts/default.asp<br /><br />This page urges customers to &quot;Get the Facts&quot;, don't be fooled by the Linux Hype. &nbsp;Microsoft is cheaper to own, cheaper to maintain. &nbsp;Windows 2003 is better, and faster as a web server. &nbsp;Windows 2000 is better than linux as a File server. &nbsp;And the .NET platform is cheaper to develop on than J2EE/Linux. &nbsp;(I like how Java = Linux now, when did that happen?)<br /><br />The only competition to this seems to be IBM, all they push lately is Linux. &nbsp;You think anybody else will get behind them and continue to push for linux? &nbsp;Does anybody buy into the M$ hype?<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: Bill Gates in his FUD page</div><div class="quote">Windows Server 2003 Far Less Expensive to Operate Than Linux Mainframe.<br />&quot;Mainframe Linux Benchmark Project&quot;<br />Meta Group<br />Microsoft-sponsored benchmarks prove that multiple Windows Web servers perform better than a Linux mainframe acting as a Web server consolidator. An independent review by Meta verified the integrity of the results. The superior performance of Microsoft Windows Server&#8482; 2003 costs just:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * <b>$40.25 per megabit of throughput per second.</b><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * <b>$1.79 per peak request per second.</b><br /></div><br /><i>emphasis mine</i><br /><br />At $40.25 per second to operate, I don't see that as less expensive than Linux. That comes out to $1,269,324,000 per year. I don't do anything really complicated with my Linux machines, but I certainly have never even spent close to that.<br /><br />They either need to lower thier prices or learn to write better press releases. Because, for some reason, I am having trouble seeing where almost $1.3 Billion is cheaper than what I paid for my machines.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok, <i>how many</i> Windows servers versus <i>what</i> mainframe? This is a rediculous statement without the setup. Hey, I can run a triple-homed (agrigated) OpenMosix cluster of 256 quad Xeons with 4GB of memory and fibre channel and blow the doors off of their Windows setup. So what?</div>
