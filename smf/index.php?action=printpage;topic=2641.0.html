					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">For me this is a new type of hardware that I had no knowledge existed till yesterday. A stand alone, or external, hard drive that sits on the network solely as a storage device. It is similar to an external hard drive that connects via IEEE-1394 or USB 2.0. The biggest difference is that this does not connect to just one machine. Since it is attached to the network via standard CAT-5 cabling, it is available to all the computers on the network.<br /><br />I guess I am familiar with file servers which are essentially the same thing. But this device is an enclosure that you put your own drive into. Just like a Firewire or USB 2.0 drive. Enclosure sells for about $100.<br /><br />A review can be seen here: http://www.tomsnetworking.com/Reviews-223-ProdID-ADSNASKIT.php<br /><br />The company and product are here: http://www.adstech.com/products/NAS-806-EF/intro/NAS_806_intro.asp?pid=NAS-806-EF<br /><br />This one happens to have a bittorrent client built in. Also a web server. Not sure how robust the web server is.<br /><br />Sounds like a very nice addition to a network. As an example of where this comes in handy is if you share a drive on one computer with others. That requires the computer that the shared drive is on to be powered up, even if you do not need that computer for anything else but to share files. Some of you may have file servers running. For me, I share a drive with my wife on her machine. When she cuts out at night (hours before I do), I either lose my share, or have to make the trip downstairs to shut off her computer when I am done.<br /><br />Just thought I would share this product I found with you (pun intended).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I tried the Linksys NSLU2 a few months ago. You may remember it from this thread (http://www.pcolalug.org/smf/index.php?topic=2487.0). Anyhow, that unit was awful and worked by attaching a USB external harddrive to the unit. Because of that experience, I am very skeptical about the quality of any of the &quot;consumer level&quot; network attached storage units.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I do remember that now, but did not realize that is what your post was about.<br /><br />The nice thing about this one is that it is a standard hard drive, does not have to be a USB2 drive. <br /><br />Reports are that it is noisy. One complaint was that it does not allow spaces in the file names on the web server. :o The complainer must be used to IIS or something. I don&#039;t have experience with web servers that allow it. Complaints I have read have been minor.<br /><br />Ruggy, you can be the guinea pig for us and buy one of these and let us know. ;)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">My old NAS (that never worked right) used a standard hard drive put into a USB enclosure that worked fine. Unless there is a really loud fan in it, I would imagine a quiet hard drive would make it pretty quiet. That&#039;s weird about the spaces in the file names. I guess their http server is something seriously cut down for sake of space.<br /><br />And I think I&#039;ll pass on paying money on one of these. Did you see the opinions (http://www.tomsnetworking.com/ProductOpinions-ADSNASKIT.php)?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: rugmonster</div><div class="quote"> Did you see the opinions (http://www.tomsnetworking.com/ProductOpinions-ADSNASKIT.php)?</div><br />Yes I did. They are 100% negative. But if you actually read the 6 posts, only 2 of them have real complaints. The rest are registered as negative because they gave no score to the product. 1 of the 6 was not even a comment about the product, but about the company. I don&#039;t think there is enough of an opinion there to draw a good conclusion. Someone would have to research it more.<br /><br />Actually sounds like a good device for my needs. Even if it is loud, I can locate it in a place where it is out of the way. Beings that it is just a file server, it would not have to be within earshot of my office.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That&#039;s exactly why I got the NSLU2. I just wonder about the quality of the devices, that&#039;s all. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think we have to do some more research and see what others might be saying. May take some time to get many reviews out there. I saw Jim Louderback talking about it on DigitalLifeTV (http://www.digitallifetv.com) from episode 8. He liked it, but complained about the noise factor too.<br /><br />My wife loves the idea of this device (which means that I can buy one in the not too distant future). So I guess I will have to do some research and let you know what I find. Probably won&#039;t happen until just before I am ready to plop down the money.</div>
