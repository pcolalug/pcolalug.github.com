					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Alright, I just made three Knoppix coasters since none of them are bootable, apparently. &nbsp;How do you make a CD bootable when burning in K3B? &nbsp;Apparently just burning the ISO isn't enough.<br /><br />EDIT: &nbsp;Oh, I did just have a thought. &nbsp;I just double-clicked on the ISO from within K3B and assumed it was intelligent enough to realize I wanted that disc burned, not a disc with that ISO, but haven't had a chance to check. &nbsp;Is there another way I'm supposed to burn ISO?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Also, if you're using KDE, you can right-click the .iso file, choose <i>Actions</i> from the service menu, then choose <i>Burn with K3B</i>.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Interesting, but if you double-click on teh file from within K3B it only burns the image itself. &nbsp;Very, very interesting.<br /><br /><br />Hmm, if that's the way it works okay, I suppose I would've liked it coded a bit different but I won't complain given how well the program works. &nbsp;Now I've just got to see if I can upgrade cdrecord so I can start doing crazy stuff.</div>

The only reason for this in my mind is so that if you have several smaller .isos that you want to burn to a single CD or DVD, this makes it possible.<br /><br />Should it be the default action? I don't know, but the way it does it works for me.<br /><br />Try burning a bootable ISO image in XP. If you can do it without an add on program, you have figured out something that has alluded me.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Without an add-in program I can't even boot-up XP! :lol:<br /><br />Just kidding, but in all seriousness I boot over into Linux everytime I want to actually do something worthwhile and not have to worry about add-in programs since Linux comes with so many and many more are freely available.<br /><br />I found something for XP called &quot;ISO Recorder&quot; or something like that. &nbsp;I'll see if I can dig up its name when I get home. &nbsp;Wonderful small program that rips ISOs and records ISOs and copies CDs but for whatever odd reason will NOT copy or rip an audio CD. &nbsp;Weird. &nbsp;Still, it rips those ISOs which is the only reason I've got Slack 10.0 disks now.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Oh, I got Knoppix v.6.3 and Knoppix-STD v.0.1 and they're bootable, just neither boot any of my systems. &nbsp;They go to SCSI probe and they both hang. &nbsp;Wonderful. &nbsp; :roll:</div>
