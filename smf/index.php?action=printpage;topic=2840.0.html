					Title: <b>Dual boot option not working</b><br />
					Post by: <b>Perquisitor</b> on <b>April 13, 2006, 02:32:35 pm</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Two days ago I bought a new monitor, a Viewsonic 1912wb.&nbsp; Previously I had a Viewsonic CRT monitor.&nbsp; <br />To install the new monitor I followed the instructions.....shutting down the computer, disconnecting the old, connecting the new, turning on the new, then turning on the computer and booting the system.&nbsp; &nbsp;Here is the problem........ I have a dual boot system, Mandriva and Windows XP;&nbsp; I have always been able to select which OS I want to work in by &quot;highlighting&quot; either Mandriva or Windows with my up and down arrows on the keyboard.&nbsp; &nbsp;After installing the new monitor however, my keyboard remains disabled during the boot-up process and because I have Mandriva as the default OS, I can only boot into it.&nbsp; After my desktop installs, when the boot-up process is complete, my keyboard is fully functional again.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how my new monitor could be effecting the keyboard during boot-up...... and I never had this problem before installing this monitor.&nbsp; &nbsp; I tried connecting the old monitor back to my system to see if I could isolate the problem, but the keyboard does not work with that monitor during the boot-up process any longer either.<br /><br />If someone has the answer, or an idea........ that would be appreciated.<br /><br />system:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Asus A7N266-E motherboard&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 512 MB RAM&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mandriva 2006&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PNY GeForce 6200 AGP 8x 128 MB video card<br /><br />thanks</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you are using a USB keyboard, I would suggest finding the legacy device support in your BIOS and turn it on. This will make the BIOS treat your USB devices as legacy device (PS/2 style keyboard/mouse).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Rugmonster,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks so much for your help.&nbsp; &nbsp;Your suggestion solved the problem.&nbsp; &nbsp; I have no idea how the problem initiated......as I said, the previous monitor worked fine, and I&#039;ve been using this same keyboard for a couple of years now.<br /><br />No matter......... it&#039;s now working.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks again.</div>
