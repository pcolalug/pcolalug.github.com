					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay fellow slackware (and dropline gnome) fans. &nbsp;What's going on? <br /><br />According to the Dropline Gnome (http://www.dropline.net/forums/) site, the maintainer Todd is quitting for lack of time and energy to put into the project. &nbsp;He's looking to hand it off to someone else. &nbsp;<br /><br />Also the Slackware Linux founder and developer Pat V is sick and nobody is sure when / if he'll be coming back . So slackware itself might even be over.<br /><br />Any thoughts / updates? &nbsp;<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Pat V is indeed very sick... &nbsp;He is being treated at the Mayo Clinic, and the outlook so far is not so great...<br /><br />Here is an update from him, posted just this evening:<br /><br />http://slackware.osuosl.org/slackware-current/PAT-NEEDS-YOUR-HELP.txt<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Why should an open source project cease to exist should the founder or project lead leave? I think there are enough people surrounding these projects to step up and who is to say one of us couldn't be one of those people. Rather than be chicken little, let's find out what we can do to keep the goodness going.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">As an outsider and one who has not followed Slackware, nor am I a huge fan, here are my comments. (I may get a flame war going finally :twisted: )<br /><br />That is just the way Pat V wants it...a one man show.<br /><br />This whole distro has risen and fallen on him. Slackers worship the ground he walks on. And &quot;if Pat V didn't approve of it, then I ain't gonna touch it!&quot;<br /><br />I really know nothing much about Slack, but this is the feel I get from the community when Slack is brought up. I could be way off base, but that is my assesment.<br /><br />I do want to say though, from what I have been reading over the last two weeks, he really is probably a real nice guy. And I really feel bad about his situation. Our medical situation is all messed up.<br /><br />My insurance will fly me back to the States to have certain proceedures done, but sometimes I wonder if I would be better off having it done here. When I go back home for something they are going to want to go through all the tests again, &quot;Cause we cannot trust what a Dr. from another country says.&quot; By which time, I may be dead.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">One of the reason he has a following is due to the nature of<br />slack... right out of the box installed and KDEed, it works.<br /><br />No real issues. Only thing i've had a problem with is updating Apache with SSL and PHP. &nbsp;So i just upgraded to slack 10 and i'm fine. &nbsp;8)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, Patrick is back on his feet and is home once again, and released a pretty good chunk of slackware updates which is definetely a good sign.<br /><br />http://slackware.com/changelog/current.php?cpu=i386<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote"><br />Sat Dec 18 23:22:21 PST 2004<br />&quot; &quot;<br /><br />Hi folks. Well, I'm back in California and I'm happy to let you all know<br />that I'm feeling much better. :-) Here are a few updates so you can see<br />that I'm trying to get back into the swing of things. Hopefully 10.1 won't<br />be too far off (I'm still trying to figure out just how far behind we are,<br />and what other fixes need to get merged in), and then we can look at what<br />exactly needs to be done to try to switch over to the new kernel series for<br />11, or sometime later on. I still don't think it's time for that yet (it<br />will be best to wait until 2.4 can be abandoned). Besides, I should<br />probably be trying to take it easy as much as I can.<br />There's no need to try for an encore...<br /><br />I offer my thanks and gratitude to the many people who sent me kind words<br />and good advice, or indeed anything at all. I figure it was all for a<br />reason, and that there were always lessons to be learned. Hopefully I'll<br />learn them now! ;-)<br /><br />Most of these fine people will remain anonymous, however, one of my<br />doctors was Leonardo Faoro, a medical resident at the Mayo Clinic. He's<br />running a support site for cancer patients at:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.cancerforums.net<br />and if you feel his site might be useful for yourself or anyone you know,<br />please spread the word about it. Leo is a good guy and one heck of a<br />great doctor, and giving his site a little plug here is the least I can do.<br />He didn't ask for it, but don't think he'll mind.<br /><br />Very best wishes to all, good luck in 2005, and THANKS AGAIN!,<br />It's good to be back. :-)<br /><br />I think I've been helped now, so this text file won't hang<br />around forever, but I'll leave it at<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://slackware.com/~volkerdi/PAT-NEEDS-YOUR-HELP.txt<br /><br />for a little while in case anyone is still interested.<br />It's the closest thing to a blog I've ever done. (ooooo! ;-)<br /><br />Take care,<br /><br />Pat<br /></div></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That's great news! &nbsp;I hate hearing about how great, positive members of humanity always seem to be taken from us for inexplicable reasons and I'm quite glad that so far it seems he's not going to be one of them.</div>
