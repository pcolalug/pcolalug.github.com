					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you havn't read bhoff's report on O'Reilly, go do that now. &nbsp;There are exciting things afoot. &nbsp;In a reply, &nbsp;steve sugguested someone do a presentation each meeting. &nbsp;I think that this is a great idea and something that Liang and I had discussed previously. &nbsp;I would sugguest that we start some sort of signup sheet on the forums for folks who want to present. &nbsp;Then a moderator could get with the person in charge (who is that, btw?) and get put on the agenda for a future meeting.<br /><br />Ok, so Liang, would you be interested in doing a presentation with me about Qt? &nbsp;I havn't done as much as you with it, but we could get a good presentation together in a month or so, don't you think? &nbsp;Also, I'd love to see what you've been up ro with OpenGL.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have a notebook computer that can be used for presentations (assuming that I am in town for the meeting). If you need to do &quot;show-and-tell&quot; then this machine is available.<br /><br />David</div>
