					Title: <b>Southeast Linuxfest</b><br />
					Post by: <b>djs</b> on <b>August 13, 2008, 06:36:34 pm</b>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Good Evening:<br /><br />My name is David Stillman.&nbsp; I am a part of growing community that is starting a LinuxFest for the Southeast US.<br /><br />We, as a community, have come up with a letter to give you some more info:<br /><br /><br />Hello, we are writing to introduce to you the Southeast LinuxFest, and event being planned for<br />June 13, 2009 by several LUGS in the Southeast United States.<br /><br />Our goal is to be very similar to Ohio LinuxFest and the now defunct Atlanta Linux Showcase - a<br />fun, diverse, and community-oriented Linux convention.&nbsp; Our official mission statement is:<br /><br />&quot;The Southeast LinuxFest is a community event for anyone who wants to learn more about Linux and<br />Free &amp; Open Source software. It is part educational conference, and part social gathering. Like<br />Linux itself, it is shared with attendees of all skill levels to communicate tips, ideas,&nbsp; and to<br />benefit all who use Linux/Free Open Source Software. LinuxFest is the place to learn, to make new<br />friends, to network with new business partners, and most importantly, to have fun!&quot;<br /><br />We have made significant progress towards holding this event - we have filed for non-profit<br />corporation status in South Carolina, and have several potential sites in the Greenville-<br />Spartanburg, SC area. Several groups have already contacted us, offering volunteers and/or requesting booth space.&nbsp; We have also been in touch with Chris DiBona (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_DiBona) and Mark<br />Spencer (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Spencer), who have confirmed that they will attend our<br />event, barring any conflicts that may arise. While we are making spirited progress, we cannot do this without the support of other LUGs.&nbsp; Having<br />strong LUG support is vital to the success of our event, both in it being a memorable and enjoyable<br />experience, and in seeking sponsorship.<br /><br />Please consider officially supporting our efforts to have this annual LinuxFest in the Southeast. If your LUG is interested, we would ask that you show your support for the concept of this event by<br />allowing us to add your group to our website as official supporters, and appointing somebody in your<br />LUG to join our mailing list and attend our weekly IRC meetings (Every Tuesday at 9pm EST) so that<br />they can keep your LUG up to date on our plans as we move forward.<br /><br />There are other ways to support S.E.L.F., too.&nbsp; Help us reach your local media outlets, so that we<br />may spread the word.&nbsp; Suggest event sponsors, potential speakers, or those who might want event<br />floor space.<br /><br />This event is for you, the Linux/FOSS users in the Southeast.&nbsp; Let&#039;s make this event truly enjoyable.<br /><br />To learn more, and to keep up with our news, please visit our website:<br />http://www.southeastlinuxfest.com/wiki/<br /><br />If you are interested in attending, please register.&nbsp; It is important to us for planning venue size<br />and other considerations.<br />http://www.southeastlinuxfest.com/signup.html<br /><br />If you have any questions, suggestions, or ideas, please let us know via our IRC channel, or by emailing<br />our mailing list.&nbsp; We look forward to talking to you soon.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />The S.E.L.F. Leadership, and our supporting LUGs including UCLUG, ColaLUG, CSCLUG, LUG@NCSU, GLUG,<br />TriLUG, LUG@GT, MGALUG, Ubuntu Florida LoCo<br />http://www.southeastlinuxfest.com/wiki/index.php/LUGs_Backing_this_Event<br /></div>
