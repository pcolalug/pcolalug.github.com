					Title: <b>Blog Software</b><br />

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">My church's youth group leader has been asking me to get some blog software setup so that the youth teachers can post things and the youth can read it and post comments or questions. I've looked through quite a few blog programs and can't find one that fits the bill quite right. <br /><br /><br />I have on the server:<br /><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perl 5.6.0[/list:u]<br /></ul><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Python 1.5.2[/list:u]<br /></ul><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mod PHP 4.3.0[/list:u]<br /></ul><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">MySQL 3.23.56[/list:u]<br /></ul><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Java 1.4[/list:u]<br /><br />I need:<br /></ul><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ability for multiple posters to have their own blog(if this could be done by one program controlling them all that would be best, but if I have to set up one program multiple times on the server I suppose I could do that too)[/list:u]<br /></ul><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Obviously has to be able meet the specs above. [/list:u]<br /></ul><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Easy to use interface. Doesn't need to be fancy. Just being able to change fonts, font size, colors, bold, italic, add links, and pictures should be enough. Of the youth leaders, only myself and one other guy are computer savvy. The rest are borderline computer illiterate. I don't mind teaching them how to use it, but I don't want anything that requires them to know HTML or CSS. <br />[/list:u]<br />I want:<br /></ul><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ability to use it from any browser. I run firefox in linux and if it doesn't work right for me then I'll have to find a windows box with IE to post from. I can do it from school, so this isn't that important, though I would prefer to try to get them to use firefox on windows since I have already cleaned most of their computers of spyware.(I know firefox won't end my spyware cleaning, but it helps)[/list:u]<br /></ul><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It would also be nice if it had some themes so that I don't have to write up CSS for it. I enjoyed writing CSS until I realized I had to write a million hacks to get it to work under IE.[/list:u]</ul></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Have you looked at PHPWebSite (http://phpwebsite.appstate.edu/)? Not really blogging software per se, but has quite a bit of what you are looking for. I have not done too much with it, but have it installed with the thought of converting my whole site over to it.<br /><br />Advantages that I can see for your situation is that anyone visiting the site can suggest content. But it would be up to an admin to allow the content to be shown. Dealing with teens (even church ones) can turn up content on your church website that you may not want. Having an admin approve each item before it goes up would be a smart move. You are not talking about hundreds of posts a day (I don't think). So taking 10 minutes each day to approve or deny content should not be too time consuming.<br /><br />Configuring the software and the site to my liking has taken quite a bit of work. But adding content and approving new content is a breeze.<br /><br />I use it from Firefox on Linux without any issues.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">PHPWebSite looks like it may be able to do the job with a little bit of tweaking, thanks for the heads up. I didn't find any software that I liked 100% though I saw one or two that seemed like they could work from Hotscripts. CMS Made Simple looked like it could have some promise. I will certainly check out Hotscripts in the future when looking for something for my site. I think I'll use one of those in the meantime while I work on tweaking something to be just what I want. I guess maybe I am too picky sometimes. Thanks again for your suggestions guys.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, now that you mention it I have been thinking of making a Java applet that does all of the admin stuff as well as providing a simple text editor like interface for posting that automatically uploads files when they are linked to by the post to some sort of server cache. That way they can post from anywhere and it should run in any browser(with java installed) and all of the tech stuff is hidden from the posters. Then using php to display the posts. Comments would be handled by php and would only allow for plain text. Probably on a mySQL db since that is what is usually offered. Anyways, I'll let you guys know if I make myself finally start coding that.</div>
