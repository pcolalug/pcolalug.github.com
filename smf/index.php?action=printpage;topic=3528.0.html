How about publishers who insist on maintaining their print list price for the e-version? Btw, for the record, at O&#039;Reilly we typically fall somewhere in between; our &quot;digital list price&quot; is generally less than the print list price and, of course, Amazon is free to discount to an even lower price. As a consumer, when I see a Kindle price over $9.99 I&#039;m highly likely to skip it.<br /><br />More Geo-Games: Ship Simulator on Google Earth<br />At Google I/O 2008 the Google Earth API was released. It brought Google Earth&#039;s 3D capabilities to the web (with the help of browser extensions). Since that release they&#039;ve started supporting Macs. One really nice part of the Google Earth API is the ability to create games in the 3D world.<br /><br />Scribd Store a Welcome Addition to Ebook Market (and 650 O&#039;Reilly Titles Included)<br />The document-sharing site Scribd has launched a new &quot;Scribd Store&quot; selling view and download access to documents and books.

(Scribd will soon be adding EPUB as a format, and we&#039;ll make that available as soon as possible.)<br /><br />Being a Suggested User Leads to Thousands of Twitter Followers<br />Ever since Twitter started suggesting accounts to new users, it was clear that those on the suggested users list were gaining thousands of followers. Setting aside the fact that number of followers is a poor gauge of influence (see our Twitter report for details), I wanted to know how many followers a suggested account gains by appearing on the list.<br /><br />Announcing InsideRIA Conference<br />Yep, you heard correctly in association with the 360Conferences guys, InsideRIA is having its first conference August 23-24, 2009 in San Jose, CA at the eBay facilities. This 2-day event will get into the nitty gritty of developing for the Rich Internet Application (RIA) space. Sunday will be hands-on workshops to get you familiar with a few of the RIA platforms. Monday will be a full day of sessions with 3 distinct tracks: Development, Design/User Experience and Business Development. All 3 tracks will be aimed at the RIA platform in general.<br /><br />Until next time--<br />Marsee Henon</div></div>
