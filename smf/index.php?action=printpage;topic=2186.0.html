					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi guys,<br /><br />I've most likely landed myself a 'programming' job. &nbsp;Its a company up here in auburn (http://www.commerce-networks.com/). &nbsp;<br /><br />While I'm excited about getting some on the job experience programming, it's tempered by the fact that these guys absolutely love all things microsoft (their shop uses C#, and .Net for the heavy work), and the pay is $7.00 an hour. &nbsp;Of course, this is my first programming gig, and I don't really know what to expect. &nbsp;<br /><br />I'll keep an eye out for other positions, but this'll likely be it for this semester.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I hope you get it. I'm not an experienced programmer by any stretch, but from what I understand, any experience is good experience.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Congrats! Expectations will get you in trouble though. Programming skills evolve pretty much regardless of the language/platform (VB excepted, of course; avoid this at all costs). If you pay attention and recognize the patterns in what you are doing, the rest is syntax.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Wow, somebody dug up and *old* post.<br /><br />I&#039;ve since moved back to pensacola, and i&#039;ve been semi-hunting a job since then.&nbsp; I have one that I&#039;m gona apply to soon, and I&#039;m more than likely gona land an internship this summer working *somewhere for the fed*.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping to land a gov job somewhere in pensacola for the internship, then I could transition into a coop with them.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how well government jobs pay vs the private sector, but I would really like to get a job with the fed, as they treat their employees well, and they have outstanding benifits for those who stick with it.</div>
