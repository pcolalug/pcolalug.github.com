					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">How-to get a Lexar Usb-Drive working.<br />By: Brett Hoff<br /><br />First I have not did this on my own!<br />I have brought all the information together and tried it for effect, But that is all.<br />As they say &quot;If I have seen further than other men It is because I was standing on the shoulders of Great Men!&quot;<br /><br />I recieved for Christmas a brand new Lexar 128 meg Usb-Drive and found out right away that it was not supported to in Linux.<br />But that did not sway me. Being Linux is so flexible I simply did a google for Lexar usb in Linux and immediately was flooded with several pages of information.<br /><br />Thankfully There are already modules built for Usb support as early as Kernel 2-4-7 and probaly earlier. I am using the 2-4-18 kernel with Redhat 7.2 and the following had me going quickly.<br /><br />First I did a nice tail /var/log/message to see if my default kernel saw the Usb device and saw that there where several usb messages. At this point I knew that I had usb suuport and did not need to load any modules. If there had not been any listings in /var/log/message then I would have to load the following modules.<br />usb-storage and usb-uhci<br />they then list my Usb-Drive under /dev/sda1 showing as a scsi device.<br /><br />All that is needed is to mount the Usb-Drive.<br />First create your mount point<br />mkdir /mnt/usbkey&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#that is what I called mine anyhow...What ever you like.<br /><br />Second mount the Usb-Drive<br />mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /mnt/usbkey<br />now you should have your Usb-Drive mounted under /mnt/usbkey<br /><br />Note: you may note that you have to use the -t vfat option to mount it.<br />I tried all the other options and that is the only one that worked.<br />Someone may try to convert to the ext2 or ext3 format...<br /><br />To make things easier you may go ahead and set up the fstab file for the Usb-Drive. I set mine up so anyone could drop files to the drive.<br /><br />vi /etc/fstab<br />Goto the first blank line at the end of your present listing and<br />i to insert then<br />/dev/sda1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/mnt/usbkey&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vfat noauto,users,umask=000,gid=600 0 0<br />then the esc key and :wq to save.<br />There you go you are all setup to use your Usb-Drive .<br />It does not automatically mount you will have to type <br />mount /mnt/usbkey to do this.<br /><br />Hope this Helps <br />Brett Hoff</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ignorant little me. I got a Lexar 128MB drive for my birthday. I just plugged it in and expected it to work. It did! I was happy.<br /><br />Running Mandrake 9.2. It built it's own mnt point. I think it was /mnt/removeable.<br /><br />Actually, come to think of it, I may have had to go into the Mandrake Control Center and search for mount points. But then after doing that it was available at /mnt/removeable.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I will have to add a line stating this is for kernel 2-4-20 and lower.<br />2.5 kernels and higher had very good usb support. But prior to that it was so so. I am using Redhat 7.2 with 2-4-18 kernel.<br /><br />But atlast I was on a roll with USB that I decided to get my ephoto cl18 camera to work also and after a code session last night I manage to get control of my camera too. Also works with most major usb camera's.<br /><br />Anyone interested in these how-to's ?</div>
