					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I read an interesting &nbsp;article by Dvorak &nbsp;(http://abcnews.go.com/sections/scitech/ZDM/MS_word_commentary_pcmag_040824.html)tonight. It is basically about some of the frustrations that he has come to experience with Word recently.<br /><br />Does anyone here use Word (by choice or force) that has experienced some of the things he mentions? Or other frustrations? I am not a Word user. I have not used Word regularly since Word for Macintosh way back in my college days (88-94). So I really have no opinion or experience.<br /><br />I am in love with OOo (OpenOffice.org). There are some things that I don't like about it, but I can forgive it since I am not paying anything for it. I couldn't forgive Word if I paid $250 (or whatever it costs) for it and it required me to install a component every time I opened a document.<br /><br />Besides being a Microsoft product, why would you not use Word? Is it really that bad?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I really haven't used it very much in the last couple of years, and that's been mostly to view documents that others send me at work. The reason I don't use it, even though it is the &quot;standard&quot; word-processing program at my job, is that any document I need to create is expressed just fine in an email or with notepad. I rarely need to insert graphics or formulas (the latter is a bit of a PITA in Word anyway), and the &quot;help&quot; Word provides as one edits a document has driven me to blinding fits of rage on more than one occasion.<br /><br />Oh, and if I do need to layout a document with graphics, formulas, links to other documents, and text, I generally use HTML. Its simpler, easier to get the layout right and, most of all, very portable (the way I write it, anyway). I see and hear a lot about the TeX family of layout languages and keep meaning to learn more about it, but never really have the time when I have the need. Anyone here know about LaTeX or its kin?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">We use MS Word at work and it's really frustrating. &nbsp;I can open existing documents with it, but if I try to just start Word (or any MS Office app) to create a new document, it prompts me to insert the MS Office Pro CD (which I don't have, and can't find from anyone at work). &nbsp;And that gets me into the infinite Retry / Cancel dialogs that won't go away until a reboot. &nbsp;<br /><br />Yeah that's annoying.<br /><br />Taking Physics at school this semester and we have to submit a lab report every week in MS-Word format with embedded spreadsheets with graphs to present our data. &nbsp;I'm doing my first lab on OpenOffice (actually StarOffice but basically the same) this weekend. &nbsp;I'll let you know if I hit any shortcommings / conversion problems.<br /><br />On another note, I'm posting this from Links so if something looks strange that's probably why.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I know programs get corrupted and have to either be reinstalled or repaired. Do you think this happens to MS Word more often than other programs?<br /><br />I get frustrated by the extra features in OOo sometimes. I have gotten pretty good at ignoring whatever that thing is that comes up in the bottom right hand corner. I can turn it off but have never let it bother me enough. I think that someday it might be helpful. I have been typing outlines the last couple of weeks. Whoever thought up the automatic outlining tool in OOo ought to be taken out back and shot. It is really stupid. Either I don't know how an outline is supposed to be built or that person was on dope when they thought they were helping the cause. And on top of that, OOo included it as a feature!<br /><br />The automatic features are turned on so that you will know that they exist. I doubt a new word processor user would think to look and see if there was such a thing as Autocomplete feature if it were not turned on to begin with. I can see making you turn it off manually as being the default, but I still don't like a good number of those features, and I haven't talked to many who do like them.<br /><br />My point here is not to bash MS Word necessarily. Just wondering if you guys think it is as bad as Dvorak has experienced. It seems for some it is. And for others it is just par for the course of any program. Dvorak can be somewhat stupidly opinionated at times. Though I enjoy reading him, sometimes I want to check up on him to see if he just has a corn cob stuck up somewhere this week.</div>

(You have to remember, there are a lot of computers running Office out there. How many of them have problems with Office)<br /><br />I've been working at a local retailer part time for two years supporting computers and of the probably 1000+ computers I've worked on in that time, I've never had a corrupted MS Word.<br /><br />I've supported 150 Users at my full time job for 5 years now and have seen corrupted Office installs not more than three times. Those were normally due to Virus infections, Users trying to clean up their drives and deleteing needed files, &nbsp;or trying to add components from Office Disks that aren't the same version as they were running. ie, trying to add components to Office 2000 using Office 2003 CDs.<br /><br />Prior to that I suspported 900 Users for the Navy on a closed network (No access to the internet and locked down workstations) We had 0 corruptions in Office files. <br /><br />Office has had &nbsp;problems in the past and will in the future. But that's why, like most apps on the market, there are knowlege bases for troubleshooting the problems.<br /><br />I've read where users have continueous probalems with Office, but I normally chalk that up to incompetant users or incampatible hardware/software. Remember, If your car is broke, it doesn't matter what grade of gas you put in, it's not going to run.<br /><br />Anyway, if you need any help with Office problems, let me know and I'll do what I can.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for all the tips, steve!<br /><br />This thread has made me realize that the less time I have to spend in a &quot;modern&quot; word processing application, the better... ;). <br /><br />Once upon a time, the Office Suite (TM) was <i>the</i> killer application. Microsoft fought and won that battle a decade or so ago. I honestly think that it was/is a decent product, but I'm wondering if its something that most user's even need. As for my Un-answerable Question of the Post (TM), how many folks shell out the bucks for Office and only use Word and maybe Excel on occasion? How many folks take the time to download and install OO.o/StarOffice and never start the program (mostly because the bulk of their coorespondence takes place in tiny text fields on web sites and email)? Maybe its just my prejuices, but these suites don't seem like the &quot;must-have&quot; for the general computer user (both home and office) that they once were.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">rburt3,<br />I think they still have their place. It is hard to pin down who the average computer user is today. I think many first time buyers are probably students going off to college. They definately need a word processor. As much as you people in the computer industry would like to think that computers and email will put paper out of business, it isn't going to happen soon.<br /><br />People like you who work with computers don't understand us who use computers. A computer as a tool, I think, requires a word processor, at least. Spreadsheet may not be that necessary. Database? Let's face it, most people don't know how to set one up and it is so easy to buy something specific to your needs today. Presentation software I think is growing in need today. And believe me, I have seen enough cheezy presentations to know that it is not just the professional doing them. I have done a few of those cheezy ones myself. What else does Office come with?<br /><br />I have obtained both Office 97 and 2000 for the use of PowerPoint (the best software Microsoft made). I got the whole suite because of the off chance that I might use one of the other components. I never have.<br /><br />I agree that there is alot more to do with a computer these days, but the office suite is not dead. OOo is doing a great job of providing a good suite that does what anybody really needs to do with a suite. And the price is great. The problem with many of the word processors today is that they are trying &quot;to be all things to all men.&quot; Too many people are trying to do page layout with a word processor. That is not what it was originally designed for and it really does not do that well. Buy a real program if that is what you want to do. Someday we will see whole magazines laid out in Word. Perish the thought!</div>

As for purchasing a layout tool, I've was hearing really good things about Scribus a few months back with their latest release. As for mags laid out in Word, I doubt it. I think you'll pry Macs from publisher's cold dead hands. From what I hear, their layout and graphics tools just can't be beat in a desktop machine.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">/. pointed to an article (http://www.flexbeta.net/main/articles.php?action=show&amp;id=78) comparing Abiword and MS Word the other day. The article leaned heavily toward Abiword, but I have used it in the past and honestly like it. For just word processing, I like it over MS Word and OOo.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: rburt3</div><div class="quote">...these suites don't seem like the &quot;must-have&quot; for the general computer user (both home and office) that they once were.</div><br /><br />Depends on what you're doing. I use Word and Excel off and on. When I have to give a briefing, Powerpoint comes in quite handy. Outlook is my email and management software at work and use it every single day. Do I use Access or Publisher? Not at all. If I have to use a db, I would rather make up an asp/php and sql web based application. At home, I hardly ever use a single component of MS Office. Excel is about the only thing and that is for tracking my finances, which could be done much better with software designed for that.<br /><br />As for OOo and StarOffice being a free to low cost replacement for MS Office, I know it can be in the right circumstances. My uncle Larry, not the most computer savvy person surprised the crap out of me when he told me he bought StarOffice and loved it. He raves about the savings and the quality of the software. When I told him about OOo, he was thrilled and have heard recently he has installed it and is using it over his older version of StarOffice.<br /><br />When I was running Linux on all of my systems at home, I used OOo. A lot of the emails I get at work have MS Office attachments in the form of PowerPoint presentations, as well as MS Word and Excel documents. PowerPoint presentations just rendered terribly and some Word documents came out very poorly. Keep in mind, at work, we use Office 2000 and Office XP which are one or two releases old.<br /><br />In my case, I was not satisfied with the handling of the MS Office documents by OOo. My uncle on the other hand, who doesn't have to worry about interaction with MS Office users so much, has found a low-cost substitute that meets all of his needs and then some. If I were a college student and merely had to write papers, I would probably be using a combination of Abiword and OOo, but in my current situation, I'm locked into using MS Office if I ever want to see the stuff I get from work that I sometimes read at home.</div>

I don't know if they are a replacement simply because of the compatability issue. I think you can do everything with the componets in OOo that most people would need to do that correspond with their Office counterparts. But I don't think they are compatible enough for most business use. If you can get your organization to use it, then it would be great. But if you are having to interact with Office alot, then maybe not. For me, when I interact with Office documents, it is not a life or death situation and I can reformat anything that I need. I realize not everyone else can.<br /><br />I am pleased with OOo for my use and my whole organization uses it (all 2 of us). So it is not a compatability issue at all.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I know this is a bit tired as a gripe, but do even a <i>fraction</i> of the documents that are blasted around on corporate networks and the internet require all the formatting and crap? I mean, really. I know I sound like a 1337 jackass, but if I get .doc files at home then I either 1) delete them without even trying to open them if I'm pretty sure they're useless (like the &quot;jokes&quot; my MIL sends us on occasion), or 2) send a polite email response to the person asking for a more standard format like text, rtf (ugh!), or even pdf (if you've <i>got</i> to have all of that fuzzy formatting). Do I just not get enough attachments?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I do one thing with attachments in MS format. I delete them.<br /><br />I don't open them. I don't care what they are. I don't care who they are from. <br /><br />Now I know I am also not in a corporate environment, so I don't deal with that much. But, no, I don't believe that they need all of that frilly stuff. It is just irritating junk mostly. The only time that is useful is if you are collaborating on a project and obviously you know what the project is and what program to use.<br /><br />I think that most stuff sent with formating can easily be taken care of by PDF, or no formatting at all. I think even if you sent me a OOo document, unless I was checking your formatting for a flyer or some kind of advertisment, then just the content is important.<br /><br />This is a good idea for a poll question. I think I will do that.</div>
