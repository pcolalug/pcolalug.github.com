					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Lindows has just changed their name to Linspire.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote"><br />In the US, we have the rule of &quot;double jeopardy,&quot; which says you can't be tried for the same offense multiple times. This is because putting defendants through multiple identical trials is patently unfair - regardless of the outcome. This is exactly what Microsoft is doing. They sued us over the trademark in the U.S., where both companies reside, and we have repeatedly prevailed. After about two years, they began suing us in multiple foreign countries over the exact same issue, while delaying the U.S. action. At about sextuple jeopardy, we had no choice but to select a different product name internationally. (I had to look up 'sextuple' - it's not a word that I use every day, and it means 6 times.) The simple truth is that the sheer number of lawsuits launched by the richest company in the world is tough for any company to withstand. In addition to our victories in the United States, last week we won our case in France when the Court in Paris rejected Microsoft's demand for a preliminary injunction, but we must still change our name - what a shame. This is not how the legal system is supposed to work. <br /></div><br /><br />Out of all the distro's I run currently, this one is my favorite. &nbsp;I've got it installed on two systems at home right now. &nbsp;Once the new version is released with KDE 3.2 and kernel 2.6 some of you guys might wanna give it a try. &nbsp;My brother is not a linux user and has XP on his machine right now but I'm going to be replacing that with lindows. &nbsp;His system needs a reload anyway this will give me a chance to see if this is really as usable as windows is for a non-tech type.<br /><br />Nick</div>
