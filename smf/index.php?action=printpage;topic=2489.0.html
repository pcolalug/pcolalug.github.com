					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><b>The Official Gnome 2 Developer's Guide</b><br /><br />(http://www.nostarch.com/images/gnome_cov.gif) (http://www.nostarch.com/frameset.php?startat=gnome_foundation)<br /><br />I got this book to use as sort of a reference / guide to the Gnome libraries while learning the Java-Gnome bindings. &nbsp;This book was written by C programmers for C programmers. &nbsp;It's usefulness as a guide / reference for other languages is kind of limited (unless you happen to know C). &nbsp;This would probably be better if I knew C or the Gnome API coming into this, but knowing neither it can get tough to follow some parts.<br /><br />I started off trying to learn the Java-Gnome bindings, but started toying with the Mono project early on - and found it to be a much easier platform to get started with. &nbsp;(But I still think GNU's Java Compiler is the right way to go, I plan to pursue this some more). &nbsp;The mono-GTK# platform will run on older software (Gnome 2.6) than Java-Gnome (Maybe Gnome 2.8, or 2.10).<br /><br />As an overview of the Gnome / GTK platform, this book is great. &nbsp;You can get a good overview of how the various libraries work together. &nbsp;The book covers the basic GTK and GDK libraries (sort of the base libraries that Gnome is built on). &nbsp;It also covers the Gnome libraries which cover services like Gconf (a registry-like service for storing program configurations). &nbsp;<br /><br />Gnome-VFS is covered briefly with some examples but I didn't have a chance to try any of it yet. &nbsp;<br /><br />The book also covers the Glade toolkit. &nbsp;Glade is a program that allows the programmer to easily build a GUI by visually laying out components in the screen. &nbsp;This is much easier than trying to hand-code windows in your programs source. &nbsp;Glade stores your windows in standard XML files so you can easily open them and make changes at any time without touching your source code. &nbsp;Once a window is built, the programmer can use the Glade Library (libglade) to parse the XML file, and render the window on-screen. &nbsp;(It will also automatically connect your code to the window components, for example attaching code to a Quit button to shutdown your program). &nbsp;<br /><br />This book is most helpful if you use it to learn about the Gnome / GTK component you want to use, then supplimenting the material by finding examples (maybe on the web) showing details about how to actually code the component in the language you're using (Python / Java / Mono C# or VB.Net).<br /><br />Nick</div>
