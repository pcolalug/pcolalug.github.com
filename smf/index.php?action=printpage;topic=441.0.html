					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Not for those pure anti-MS at heart, but if you are working in the web dev field this may appeal to you...<br /><br /><b>Gulf Coast .NET Users Group Inaugural Meeting</b><br /><br />A group of locals are establishing the Gulf Coast .NET Users’ Group (GCNUG), a non-profit organization of .NET programmers, IT professionals, and managers in the Northwest Florida/Southern Alabama area. Since Microsoft released the .NET suite of development technologies in early 2001, there have been a growing number of developers and other IT workers who are interested in learning more about .NET and discovering opportunities for deploying it. In our area, there is a healthy community of programmers who are interested in .NET. The GCNUG is intended to meet the needs of that community.<br /><br />The GCNUG was created to provide the following services to its members:<br /><br />· Provide in-depth technical presentations and seminars on Microsoft .NET Technology and Software Engineering by leading local, regional, and national .NET experts. <br />· Provide a means for establishing contacts with colleagues in the Northwest Florida, Southern Alabama, & Southern Mississippi Area. <br />· Foster camaraderie and a spirit of cooperation and learning among GCNUG members. <br />· Improve communication with Microsoft. <br />· Establish a channel for disseminating information about new techniques and tools related to .NET <br /><br />The first meeting of the GCNUG will be on Tuesday, February 11, 2003 from 6:30 PM to 9:00 PM at:<br />University of West Florida<br />Small Business Development Center<br />401 East Chase St.<br />Suite 100<br />Pensacola, Florida 32501-6160<br /><br />We expect an audience of 30-40 for our first meeting, and plan to stage GCNUG events on a quarterly basis. There will be no charge for this meeting.<br /><br />Our speaker will be Joe Healy of Microsoft, who will present a seminar titled “Deploying .NET Applications”. The topics presented will be: <br /><br />· Successful VB.NET deployment <br />· Installation <br />· Application manifests <br />· Versioning <br /><br />The technologies discussed will be: ASP.NET, Web Services, Windows Forms, and Mobile applications<br /><br />DOOR PRIZES: A Full Retail Copy of Visual Studio.NET will be given away as a door prize as well as other nice giveaways.<br /><br />The Gulf Coast .NET Users’ Group has established a Website where anyone interested in attending this seminar and/or joining the GCNUG, can register. This site will also host group information, discussion groups, and other useful information. The Website is located at http://www.gulfcoastdotnet.org. <br /><br /><br />This article was found at:<br />http://www.accessgulfcoast.com/COMMUNITY/article.asp?aid=3957<br /><br /><i>Nick</i></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">So much for UWF. I don't know who to be more disgusted with, myself for not persuing them as a sponsor, or UWF for entertaining this farce.<br /><br />C'mon! .Net Users Group! Earth to Microsoft: You have *no* clue how to build a community and aren't equipped philisophically to do it.<br /><br />Sorry. This just struck me as trajic when I first heard about it at the last IT Gulfcoast luncheon. I shouldn't bitch, I guess and I do wish them success, I guess, but why build and be a part of a *community* based around a technology that will be forced down our (developers trying to turn a buck in this $DIETY-forsaken technological cess-pit) throats soon enough.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">YEAH! d**n the man! Kill Microsoft-y!<br /><br />*disgruntled and resistant to .NET<br /><br />On a more serious note, maybe since I have never used anything .NET, I still don't exactly get what it is all about. I heard something about some shared source and being XML based, but it just sounds like some crap to me. I wouldn't use it because I personally would like to have the freedom to make my code free if I were a programmer...but that's why I use Linux and other OSS products.<br /><br />In a related story, here is a link (http://www.netcraft.com/survey/) to the latest from netcraft (http://www.netcraft.com) web server survey. Scroll down the page and read the article about Intel and the new Winders 2003 Server (formerly known as .NET Server). Hmm...gut feeling tells me that it isn't slower hardware that is causing that slower performance. But hey, maybe they redid IIS so that maybe it won't be the cause of the downfall of the Internet...but probably not.<br /><br />*still bitter and resistant to .NET</div>

If it's going to be shoved down our thoats and we will be &quot;forced&quot; to use it, we might as well have a community or users ready for it. <br /><br />Personally, I haven't seen much of the .net stuff so I can't say whether it is a good thing or a bad thing. <br /><br />do while Soap Box time;<br /><br />One thing to remember, if it wasn't for IBM and Microsoft, we'd all be running Apple Lisa's having to use both, proprietary software and proprietary hardware made by Apple. For those that weren't around in the &quot;old&quot; days, Apple started out as an all proprietary company not releasing any specs on their hardware or software. IBM and MS won many years ago because the both used an &quot;open&quot; architecture. IBM used it's open hardware specs and MS used it's open programming specs. Anywone remember bios calls and gwbasic?<br /><br />So, back to my original point, just because MS does it, doesn't necessarily make it bad.<br /><br />end while &nbsp;Soap Box time;<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You are right, Steve, and I probably flew off the handle a little too quickly. Sleep depravation will do that to you... ;)<br /><br />Though, with a clearer head (relatively speaking, of course), I still found myself flabberghasted at the folks from the ITGC lunch the other day who described themselves as &quot;Microsoft Supporters(TM)&quot;. How can you be an MS &quot;supporter&quot;? What's to support? All your desktops are belong to us and all that. Does it mean that you support the technology itself, the morally questionable business practices, or what?<br /><br />Even back in my unenlightened days of dronery, I never considered myself an MS &quot;supporter&quot;. I loved working with computers and programming, I just didn't know there were alternatives, and so used the only platform I thought was reasonably available.<br /><br />So, the question boils down to this: What has MS ever done for you (personally or as a business) that would engender such support? Everything you get from MS is at a price. The only interest MS has in improving the state of computing technology is in filling their coffers, plain and simple. Now, this is not a value judgement and MS certainly has contributed, but contributions from OSS, generally, seem more deserving of &quot;supporters&quot; because contributions from this arena are made (generally) out of a desire to attain and propogate knowlege. Even in the case of, say, Red Hat, who's contributions to OSS are made so that their products sell, its still there in the wild, open for folks (even competitors) to learn from, emulate, expand, and improve.</div>

For someone to be a &quot;supporter&quot; would mean to me that they go out of their way to promote a company/team/product. I'm as much a MS supporter as I'm a Ford supporter, Crest Supporter, Pepsi/Coke supporter. <br /><br />I consider myself more of a user than a supporter. I don't exclusively support MS or Linux. I use both of them. <br /><br />I guess in some respects I could consider myself a &quot;supporter&quot; of both products, though. (I do support both of them when it comes to maintenance support) Anyway, I guess I support both of them for different purposes when it comes to recomendations on which to use for a customer. Depending on what's being done I support one ofr the other. <br /><br />IMHO, both MS and Linux have their strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br />Bottom line, I like both Windows and Linux. I'll probably continue to use and recommend both products for years to come.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I look at it like this. You show your support for a product/company by using and recommending to others a product or products by said company. Free software projects have a greater sense of community surrounding their products because they are made by the community. No one pays for that product because it belongs to the community unless they feel motivated to donate to the project. In the free software world, the supporters are easy to identify because they are the ones who use and contribute to the software in one way or another.<br /><br />The commercial world doesn't give us this option. They give us, the consumer, a product and we show our support by giving them money and recommendations to other consumers. Microsoft may try to encourage a community around a product or group of products, but those &quot;supporters&quot; will only be loyal to them until they find a better product with a better price or more features. Supporters of open source projects can either make suggestions to make their product better or make the change themselves. Nothing stops them from adding something to make their product exactly what they want from it to be other than their motivation and knowledge.<br /><br />One thing I have noticed is you don't find near as many &quot;evangelists&quot; out there spreading the joy of closed source software, or any other commercial product for that matter, like you do with open source software projects. Those you do find are usually motivated by the all mighty dollar and are getting paid for their outgoing support. I'm not saying that everyone in free software is oblivious to money, I'm just saying that people don't feel the sort of allegiance to commercial entities when compared to free software products and projects.</div>

Yes, they are in it to make money, as any business would be. Right? What's wrong with that?</div><br /><br />It isn't that money is evil and all corporations should die. I think the point rburt3 was trying to make is, what kind of support does a consumer give outside of spending some money on said product? The returns for your support to a commercial product are not nearly as satisfying as what you get from supporting a community based open source project. People truely believe in their open source projects and not because they have to for their job or their pay check. They believe in it because they contribute to it and feel like they are involved. No, money isn't bad and showing support to companies isn't wrong or impossible. You just tend to have stronger, more loyal supporters behind products that they can contribute to and can attribute some sense of ownership and pride that comes from being able to make that product whatever they want.</div>

The general consumer supports what works for them. I don't see that very many average Joes or Janes care whether a product is open source or whether it is comercial. The bottom line is does it do what they want to do. <br /><br />Here's an example:<br /><br />You just bought a new digital camera and you're looking for some software to be able print sheets of pictures like they do for the kids school pictures. You'd like to be able to mix pictures on the page. You narrow it down to two products. They both accomplish the above however one is open source and the other is comercial. The open source does it all but you have to do it from a command line. The comercial uses a GUI WYSIWYG interface. Most people would spend the money on the commercial app rather than getting into the open source community and helping to develop a GUI interface. <br /><br />Same as above but both products have a GUI interface and both satisfy your needs. Most people would go with the free one. Thereby supporting the open source movement but that is an after affect. It's not the reason for using and supporting the product. <br /><br />Support will be shown for the product that satisfies the consumer's needs not the product that promotes community involvement. Community involvement is just a side affect of a succesfull open source project.<br /><br />Go to sourceforge and look through the thousands of applications they have on there. What percentage have more than one or two people involved? That's not community involvement. The community involvment comes after the success of the project and is an side affect of support.<br /><br />Steve</div>

To me, when an individual says they support a product or company, they like the product and want to help it succeed.

Personally, they haven't done a thing for me. I don't agree with the freedoms they want to take from me and I don't like their ideals. IMO, they are almost the worst of what true capitalism can lead to. Why people would consider themselves supporters of this is beyond me, unless they were somehow getting some kind of kick back from MS or just didn't know any better. I'll pray for the latter. That is why we, the OSS supporters, need to educate these poor lost souls.<br /><br />Okay, I now have to say that I do use Windows and other Microsoft products, but I don't give them money. I may recommend an MS product to a family member, I do it only because there isn't a viable alternative for their level of computer knowledge. They do a great job of dumbing things down and sometimes, they have the right tool for the job, but I know my options and I am willing to look into non-MS products. It isn't that I don't like them because they are so successful; I hate them for their anti-competitive business practices and lack of regard for the consumer. Their products are generally not worth the money they charge and I refuse to waste my hard earned money on mediocrity.<br /><br />*this has been the product of three rewrites</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">One of our better discussions, don't you think?<br /><br />Anyway, I did mean supporter in the way both steve and rungmonster defined it. Supporter such that you feel so empowered, so thankful that a product/service/football team/color/whatever exists and fulfills a need that you would, and this is the essential part, form or join a group of others who feel the same way about the thing. How could one feel this way about .Net??!!<br /><br />I just can't identify with someone who would look at what MS has wroght and the price paid for same and say, &quot;Gee, I'd sure like to share this with friends and family in a group.&quot;<br /><br />See, with OSS we *can* share these things with eachother. In fact, its encouraged that we do this very thing. MS fosters an environment of secrecy and mistrust. Don't share your code. Don't share your knowledge. I have been in several shops now with programmers who didn't want to share because then you'd know what they knew and that might be a threat. Now I certainly don't blame MS for this, but that's the attitude they unwittingly foster.<br /><br />Anyway, to all. Yes, one can support MS by buying their products. But what choice do most people *feel* that they have? But buying a product is no more the &quot;support&quot; I meant than is buying a Ford. Feeling that Ford provided you with a vehicle so dependable, so economically exceptional, so smooth, sleek and sexy, that you go and hang out with other Ford owners and talk about your Fords, is what I'm talking about. I don't get it with .Net any more than I get it with Fords.<br /><br />Velveeta user's group, anyone?<br /><br />PS. Rugmonster: A couple of years ago, Ken and Linda where looking to buy their first computer. I, not knowing any better (and they not having much of a choice), reccommended an HP with Windows ('cause, hey, Windows is easy to use, right?). The calls have slowed down to only a couple a month, but in the beginning, Heather and I thought about charging them for tech support.<br /><br /><b>Windows is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> easier to use for the novice/casual computer user</b>. The <i>experienced</i> computer user will be comfortable wherever he or she finds themselves, given time and an ability to read and follow instructions.<br /><br />Now, my reccomendation to newbs is Apple if they can afford it, one of WalMart's Lycoris or Mandrake PC's if they can't. I'm going to spend less time on the phone with them in the case of the Mac, and in either case, I can have a good time locking them out of stuff until they are ready.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">(just to break it up a bit...)<br /><br />With OSS we (yes, even you) can point to Linux, xmms, Gnome, KDE, the BSD's, $FAVORITE_APP and say &quot;Look what *we* have done. Share it with us and with your friends.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;We&quot;. That's right. I've never written a line of code (yet) for any of the projects I love the most, but I have bought swag and cd's so that others can work on these projects. I've submitted bug reports. I've helped folks to learn the software. I've made sugguestions on how to make it better/faster/more user friendly. I belong to this group and through it and my personal life, promote OSS and spread the word, so to speak. I feel that I have contrubuted in some way and have gained the benifits of same. Most of you too have done these things, and if not, you will someday. If for no other reason, you tried it out and told somebody why you didn't like it, you helped because someone can get the word out to do something about it.<br /><br />With MS, *they* did it and if you don't like it, tough (well, unless you are a multi-billion dollar corp or the government of a medium-to-large country). I cannot &quot;contribute&quot; to MS's products, and if I could, I would have the privilege of *paying* to benifit from it or be sued.</div>

However, if a friend has never driven a standard and I don't have the time to teach them, I'll recommend an automatic. <br /><br />In another example: The last full computer system I bought was a 386 back in 1990. I prefer to build my own as I think I get a better product that way. But, I still recomend Dell, HP, Compaq, E-Machines, etc. to my friends and family. These systems, IMHO, are inferior machines, but I also know they are something my friends and family could handle without too much difficulty. &nbsp;Just because I can build a good computer for half the cost of a comparable Dell, does that make Dell evil?

I have been using it for several months now and I don't think it is quite there for pure computer newbies. I am using Mandrake 9.0 and half, if not more, of the tools under Mandrake Control Center do not work. Printing is not intuitive and numerous programs are crap from the CD. They regularly crash and I had to go find sources and compile myself. You guys can go look in the Mandrake section for the list of stuff I had to do to get my system working. A newbie won't even know where to get started with that. I'm okay with dealing with raw config files and reading docs and howtos, but my Dad or Grandfather would have no part of it. From what I hear about OS X, I would recommend it, but I would like to see what Lycoris is like before I give out a recommendation for it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">From what I understand, these .NET users groups are started by Microsoft directly. I read an article about that a couple of months ago. I have not googled to see if I can prove that.<br /><br />I appreciate what Microsoft has done in the past. They have worked at &quot;putting a computer on every desk.&quot; But they have lost their vision.<br /><br />If they would do today what made them great back in the early 90's, then I would be for supporting them (however you want to define support). In the past, they have innovated (maybe a little stealing of better products) and given us a useable interface for the computer. Now for the last several years they have sat on their laurels and not really given us anything new.<br /><br />For example, since Office 97, they have not given us a singnificantly more mature product today than what they had back then. Same with Windows since 98 (just a serious service pack for 95).<br /><br />That is why I dislike Microsoft. They continue to charge us for upgrades that is not really giving us more useability. And with .NET (as I understand it) you will have no option but to go with the upgrades.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Printing is a definite sticking point for me in Linux. &nbsp;There's not even a central way to configure all types of printers under a single distro. &nbsp;If I have a standard printer I can use one program to configure it, if I have a PCL printer (which I do now) I have to use apsfilter. &nbsp;Really tough to sort through sometimes.<br /><br />Nick</div>
