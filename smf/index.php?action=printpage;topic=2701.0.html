					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just taking a moment to vent.<br /><br />During the middle of doing some important work on my Win XP machine, I received a BSOD.  For a brief moment, I think it is just my screensaver kicking in, since &quot;BSOD&quot; is my Ubuntu Linux screensaver and sometimes still scares me when it displays.  I quickly snap back to reality however, once my XP machine begins rebooting.<br /><br />Thanks for listening.<br /><br />dennis</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">What were you doing to get a BSOD anyway? I swear that the majority of those come from shotty drivers. The last BSOD I got was from an experimental reiserfs driver for Windows. It didn&#039;t like directories with lots of subdirectories... :-\</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Not sure...<br /><br />One of our desktop support techs recently installed &quot;some software&quot; on my machine one day while I was working from home.  Since then, I&#039;ve had 4 or 5 BSOD&#039;s or other strange behaviours.  Since that is the only changed variable I&#039;m aware of, I&#039;m sure the problem is related to that.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">No way. Don&#039;t you know that &quot;Windows XP is the most stable, reliable Windows release&quot;? (I want to choke the next person who says that to me...I get the BSOD all the time while I am programming in Java or MATLab/Simulink.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Honestly, I gota say, I&#039;ve never had win2k bsod on me.<br /><br />However, I am forced to reboot sometimes when my fps or somesuch degrades.&nbsp; To be fair, I&#039;ve had the same thing happen (rarely) on linux, but in that case a quick hop in and out of single user mode has it purring again.&nbsp; Honestly, though, I use windows as my gaming os.&nbsp; I do my work in linux, because it&#039;s naturally better when it comes to programming.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t even have windows installed if there was a native version of civilization out for linux.&nbsp; I thought about upgrading this box over the past year, but with the next gen consoles coming out, I figure why bother.<br /><br />I see my pc becoming primarily a work machine in the future.&nbsp; I&#039;ll more than likely get a xbox360 next year, and hook it up to my computer monitor (HiDef gaming baby!)<br />There doesn&#039;t seem to be any real difference between console gaming and pc gaming anymore.&nbsp; <br /><br />*sits back and feeds the flames of a console vs pc war*&nbsp; &gt;:D </div>
