					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey guys I have been talking to a few people on this and think it would be a great idea.<br /><br />So without further ado I give you the idea.<br />A wardriving contest. <br />a mobile access point will be traveling between 17th and A st. and the bay and Cervantes.<br />the goal is to find the ssid and scan it for the webserver then associate with AP and open the webpage<br />and use the contact info to contact me to verify the winner! <br />teams must be limited to 2-4 players per vechile!<br />All teams must pre register! with team memebers cell phone info!<br />No cheating all cheaters will be disqualified!<br />there will be a special contest inbedded that will be released at race time!<br />I have sponsors lined up all ready and would like to get some input and really push this and get <br />advertising going for a march or april race to give people time to get ready and practice.<br /><br />So that is the basics let me know what you think!!!!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think it&#039;s a fantastic idea, I&#039;ve spoken with my current employer about getting a radio spot or two before the event, so we should be able to get radio coverage before the event.&nbsp; I&#039;ll also run it past as many members of the amateur radio community that I can this coming Thursday at the club meeting.&nbsp; They have experience doing fox hunt activities, should be able to provide some solid input and maybe give us a couple teams! :D<br /><br />An event like this should be great for getting the LUG exposure, great idea!<br /><br />Ian</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sounds like a fun and creative way to hopefully generate some interest in the lug.<br /><br />Depending on the date/time, and my schedule, I may be willing to be a driver in exchange for an opportunity to learn something new.&nbsp; Brett, do you need a driver?&nbsp; I&#039;ll even buy your supper.<br /><br />Nothing personal, but if I haven&#039;t met you, I probably don&#039;t want to be your driver.&nbsp; The idea of a complete stranger sitting in my car and attempting to hack as I drive is kind of scary...<br /><br />Anyway, it does sound interesting.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yossarian I have been to one of these before and generally you use laptops and one or many wireless antennas! Often more so than not it is homemade gear!<br />On the last wifirace at phreaknick there was over 60 teams and it ws a blast took over 1.5 hours for someone to win it and it was renderman and his 2 kids with there psp and one magnetic mount ant. was very funny!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I regret the excursion off-topic.<br />I think a fox-and-hound event, while not my cup of tea, is probably a good idea. Wardriving is, after all, something a lot of people are familiar with, at least on a conceptual level. That is, they&#039;ve probably at least heard of it.<br />I don&#039;t know whether having heard of it will entice them to come out, but I think that if they do come to the event, it will be a good opportunity to introduce them to some of the open-source tools available. I think that, if such an event is done, there should be a short presentation before or after the running of the fox to show off some of those tools. Perhaps, this could even be folded into the intro stuff, say as a primer on how it&#039;s done.<br />&quot;And here we&#039;re using sniff-package-xyz to etc, etc.&quot;<br />If people come to it, this could be a great thing for OSS visibility.</div>
