					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Actually, the original xbox used usb ports that were modified to make it harder to connect non-sanctioned hardware to it.&nbsp; That didn&#039;t stop modders (including myself) from getting it to work with a lil help from a soldering iron.&nbsp; <br /><br />With the 360 microsoft figured they could grab a bigger market share by making it compatible with hardware people already own.&nbsp; Thus the usb ports on this one are the bonifide real thing.&nbsp; The 360 has actuall built in support for usb keyboards and mice from the start.&nbsp; Since input is abstractly handled through the dashboard you might indeed be able to play some xbox games with a keyboard and mouse.&nbsp; This is more likely for RPG and strategy games though. I imagine there has to be at least some game side code to handle it.<br /><br />You are correct though, a controller will never be as precise as a keyboard and mouse.&nbsp; Keep in mind though, that the game is designed around the controller, and when you play online, everyone your up against is using a controller.&nbsp; From the time I&#039;ve spent playing halo, ghost recon, and the like, the games tend to handle this problem fairly well.<br /><br />The big thing to me though, is you get a modern gaming system that is *almost* par graphically with even the best pc system today (see the COD 2 review on gamespot) for 400 bucks.&nbsp; You&#039;d almost spend that much on JUST a high end graphics card.&nbsp; Also, realise that developers are porting all the latest fps titles to console, (with I might add, very little loss in visual quality).<br /><br />Anyway, my 10 cents...<br />&nbsp;:P</div>

Of the current ones that are out, the Xbox is probably the most advanced and I own one. You know what I use it for...a front end for my computer to play music and videos. Yes, it&#039;s modded and I love it for that. I will play racing games on it, but I don&#039;t like sports games. FPSs and RPGs are just better on a PC, no matter how you cut it. There is a lot that is cut down or just left out for console versions of PC games.<br /><br />There have been plenty of times that I have played games on a console and had them slow down. 10 frames per second is not smooth and I&#039;ve had this happen in Splinter Cell, Fable, GTA, Halo, etc. While the next set of consoles will be much more powerful, I can&#039;t see myself spending the money on one. I would much rather spend $300 on a good video card and have a much more robust system that I can do a whole hell of a lot more on. That and my TV isn&#039;t high definition and I&#039;m not planning on buying one any time soon, so no matter what those consoles can push out for graphics, they will still look like crap. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve experienced slowdowns in halo, and other games, but only a hand full of times, and only for a few seconds.&nbsp; It&#039;s not unheard of, but it&#039;s certianly rare.&nbsp; I dunno what&#039;s up with your system.<br /><br />Just a note, I know the 360 (and possibly the PS3?) will ship with a vga connector in the $400 pack..., so It&#039;ll hook straight up to your computer monitor.<br /><br />Related:&nbsp; Does anyone know where I can find something that will take in two vga inputs and output 1?&nbsp; Something along the lines of a dumbed down (and CHEAP!) kvm.&nbsp; whoever thought a cramped vertical vga hookup is a good solution on an lcd needs to be drug out and shot...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I personally prefer the console over computer gaming, but then again my computer is old and only runs linux. I do have a few Computer games that I love, but mostly older ones like Xcom II Terror from the Deep or Age of Empires 2. I used to play some Enemy Territory before my graphics card died. Mainly RTS is the only thing I find a need to play on the computer instead of on a console. I don&#039;t care if the graphics look better, gameplay is what makes it fun. In fact, the closer they get to realistic looking graphics the easier it jars me out of the game when I see something that just doesn&#039;t look right. I prefer when they don&#039;t try to make it look realistic but give it a style and make sure everything follows that style. As far as FPS on console goes, I can enjoy a good game of Halo, but it is not the best FPS ever like the Xbox lovers seem to think it is. I would actually prefer to play Goldeneye or Perfect Dark from the N64, but with the added ability to play online(or at least a LAN), against more players, more game modes, and with Halo&#039;s control style. Yes, mouse and keyboard are more precise, but I like some imprecision in the game, adds a little bit of believability for me. No one in real life can run and jump and hit someone in the head every time while being fired upon, but then again people in real life can&#039;t carry mulitple weapons, respawn, or take a few hits to the chest with an assault rifle either. Although, in Goldeneye I could kill other experienced players that were armed with the RPC 90 when all I had was the PPK. I guess it all comes down to personal preference and what we will let slide and what we prefer to see represented in a game.<br /><br />My views may be odd though, considering my favorite console of last generation was the Gamecube. Metroid Prime, F-Zero, Mario Kart, Pikimn, and Harvest Moon being some of my favorite games. Xbox and PS2 had a few titles that caught my eye, but never enough to get me to pay for one. Playing at my friends&#039; houses was enough. Though now that the 360 is out I may find a modded Xbox for cheap and use it as a Media center/NES and SNES emulator. I have a friend that does the mods if anyone is interested.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Man, I haven&#039;t played a good game of GoldenEye or Perfect dark in ages, it seems.&nbsp; I feel EA killed the 007 games. :)<br /><br />I can&#039;t really express a preference either way for console or PC, I&#039;m fond of both.&nbsp; A console is great for getting a few friends together for some fun.&nbsp; Now I think I&#039;m gonna bring the N64 to the upcoming LAN party. :)<br /><br />I&#039;ve also got an Xbox with a failing DVD drive in it, wish to get it modded and make it useful.&nbsp; So I&#039;d be interested in that.<br /><br />--Ian</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">i think it just boils down to personal preference.&nbsp; i myself prefer consoles, because no matter how much i try, i can&#039;t play with a mouse and keyboard, especially with fast-paced games.&nbsp; RPGs are okay with keyboards.&nbsp; my real problem is i&#039;m used to using the arrow keys with my right hand, and i also use my mouse with my right.&nbsp; my left hand skills are worthless for moving or aiming.&nbsp; my left thumb is the only part of my left hand that&#039;s worth a d**n.&nbsp; so, i&#039;m about halfway decent at console games, and the worst player in the world when it comes to any and all PC games.</div>
