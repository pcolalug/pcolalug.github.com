					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here is a USA Today (http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/2003-02-26-desktop_x.htm) article about open source software.<br /><br />For the most part it was very good. I did not appreciate the end of the article stating that OpenOffice.org does not have the features of MS Office, but that for basic word processing it can get you by. Obviously they have not used the OO.o suite. I agree that it does not have <b>all</b> the features of MS Office, but it does have most. They make it sound like it will work to get you by, but not really featurefull enough to be a solution.<br /><br />Mostly good read.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Most of the &quot;features&quot; in MS Office are bloatware and crap, put in because some whiny VP somewhere complained that Word didn't have his personal favorite feature and he played golf with Bill Gates.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The only feature worth having that's missing from OO.o is Enterprise network support. You can't use it on an Enterprise network with roaming profiles.<br /><br />Steve</div>
