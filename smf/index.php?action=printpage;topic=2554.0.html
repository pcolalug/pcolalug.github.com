					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome to the group, bfold369. When you say you bought Knoppix, you do realize it's freely available for download, right? As for membership dues, read our Mission Statement (http://www.pcolalug.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1090). We don't have a group mailing list; that's what these forums are for and our IRC channel, #pcolalug on Freenode (http://www.freenode.org). You don't have to make meetings, but if you can, that would be great. I live in Montgomery, but I'm active on the forums and the IRC channel. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask and we will do our best to help.<br /><br />I also removed your email address from you post since the forums are crawled by numerous bots and would hate to have you mailbox slammed by an excessive amount of email.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome to the group. Glad to have you.<br /><br />The group does not charge for dues, but since I live in México, I have learned how to do some under the table dealings. You are welcome to send me small unmarked bills to keep your connection to the forums going.<br /><br />But just keep this between you and me if you will.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome. &nbsp;There is a lot of information here on these forums for a beginner, and of course much more available through other Internet sources.<br /><br />In case you didn't know, there is a (new) Linux Users Group closer to you, in Fort Walton Beach. &nbsp;Not sure how organized they are, but you could say hello on their site: &nbsp;http://www.fwblinux.net<br /><br />Don't hesitate to ask if you have questions.<br /><br />Dan</div>
