					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: 1.3em;">Zalman VF700-CU VGA Cooler</span><br /><br />(http://images10.newegg.com/NeweggImage/productimage/35-118-117-01.JPG)<br /><br />I recently purchased the Zalman VF700-CU VGA Cooler from Newegg to replace the failing stock cooler on my Sapphire ATI 9800XT.&nbsp; The stock cooler&#039;s fan was dying.&nbsp; It made the commonly well known buzz, spun too slowly and worst of all, was making my video card unstable.&nbsp; I was seeing temps of 98C under load.<br /><br />Included in the package was the cooler, eight memory heat sinks, power adapter, thermal paste, screws and mounting bracket.&nbsp; <br /><br />(http://images10.newegg.com/NeweggImage/productimage/35-118-117-02.JPG)(http://images10.newegg.com/NeweggImage/productimage/35-118-117-05.JPG)<br /><br />Installation went vary smoothly.&nbsp; I wish I had taken pictures, but was being rude enough to the guests that were over.&nbsp; Basically, you remove the old cooler by unscrewing the mounting screws and with a slight twist and a pull it pops off.&nbsp; One thing that you will notice is the original thermal grease.&nbsp; My GPU was covered with some old, nasty stuff.&nbsp; To take care of the old thermal compound, I got the ArcticClean Thermal Material Remover and Surface Purifier.<br /><br />(http://images10.newegg.com/NeweggImage/productimage/35-100-010-01.JPG)<br /><br />Applying a few drops of the cleaner to the GPU and letting it sit for about a minute, I was able to wipe away all remnants of the old thermal grease.&nbsp; I repeated with the cleaner on the memory as well as the bottom on the new heatsink.&nbsp; On all of the metal surfaces, I applied the purifier part of the ArctiClean set, which is supposed to prep the surface for the thermal compound.<br /><br />One note on the installation, I mounted the cooler prior to applying the memory heatsinks.&nbsp; Yeah, that doesn&#039;t work too well since the fins on the heatsink cover a memory module on my card.&nbsp; The heatsinks have an adhesive thermal pad on them and go on by applying pressure to them.<br /><br />Rather than using included thermal compound, I used ArcticSilver 5.&nbsp; You can&#039;t use very much of this stuff or else it actually acts as an insulator, which is baaaaad.&nbsp; Mounting went very easily.&nbsp; The included instructions were very straight forward.&nbsp; To aid in removing the hot air coming off of the cooler, I put in an exhaust fan in a PCI slot below the video card. Some pictures...<br /><br />(http://img262.imageshack.us/img262/4546/img16645pp.jpg)<br /><br />(http://img288.imageshack.us/img288/5903/img16656lh.jpg)<br /><br />What were the results?&nbsp; Before, I was at 98C when I played Battlefield 2.&nbsp; Now, without overclocking, I run at about 46C. Overclocked by ~10Mhz on GPU and memory each, I run about 48C.&nbsp; I&#039;m extremely pleased.&nbsp; The other cool thing is that as the ArcticSilver bonds more with the cooler and GPU, I should see cooler temps.&nbsp; To top everything off, I think my system is actually quieter now without the bad fan even though I have two more fans in the box.&nbsp; Overall, I&#039;m extremely pleased.</div>
