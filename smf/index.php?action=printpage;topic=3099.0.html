					Title: <b>How to Listen to Podcasts in Linux</b><br />
					Post by: <b>dpeach</b> on <b>January 02, 2007, 12:28:10 am</b>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This won&#039;t be near as complicated as the Podcasting from Linux (http://www.pcolalug.org/smf/index.php?topic=3096.0) post. Listening is fairly easy. Whatever program you use to listen to MP3s is what you can use to listen to the podcasts.<br /><br />The trick is getting the podcasts into the computer to begin with. You certainly can go to the website of each podcast every few days to see if there is a new episode. Then manually download each show. But what makes a podcast special is the fact that you can &quot;subscribe&quot; to them. By subscribing you are not asking them to send you the file, rather you are telling your computer to go get them. You do this by using a podcatcher and simple RSS technology.<br /><br />A podcatcher is a program that gets the mp3 files for you. There are several command line programs that do this. There are also some GUI programs that supposedly work as well. But, I recommend that you use a command line option. Unless you have a program that interfaces well with your portable player, the command line options work great.<br /><br />This program will download the new episodes when they come out. You can set these up to check for new shows every day, every hour or manually on an irregular schedule. It will download the MP3s to a folder and then you can transfer them over to your portable player or listen to them on the computer.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have a recommendation on how best to manage shows that you have already heard. You will amass quite a few shows after a short period of time, so you want to figure out a system. Maybe someone can post in here as to how best to manage these shows. I personally use iTunes on a Mac to manage my podcasts. Therefore, I don&#039;t have experience doing this in Linux.<br /><br />There are two questions that will come up by new podcast listeners. First is wondering why you need a program to do this for you. After you get the bug for listening to podcasts, you will find more and more that interest you. You don&#039;t want to have to go around to 20 websites each week and manually download shows. I am subscribed to over 60 shows and am thankful for the automatic nature of podcasts and podcatchers.<br /><br />The second question is about &quot;used&quot; shows. &quot;Why would you need to manage shows that you have already heard?&quot; As much as you may think so now, you will not go back and listen to old episodes. And, you will have thousands of these old files in a short time. If you do need to go back and listen to an old episode in the future you can go to the podcast website and grab it again.<br /><br /><b><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.3em;">Podcatchers</span></b><br />Here are some tools that you can use to download the podcasts. You don&#039;t need all of these, but you may want to try them out to see which one you like the best. In all of these programs you will need to find out how to add the podcasts RSS feed URL. Then the program will do the rest.<br /><br />BashPodder (http://linc.homeunix.org:8080/scripts/bashpodder/): This is an older client that uses a very simple bash script to do the job. I have not used it, but just taking a casual look at the script, it seems to be very straight forward.<br /><br />GoldenPod (http://goldenpod.nongnu.org/): I have played with this a bit. It was very easy to use. Basically you just load up a .conf file with your list of RSS feeds and it does the rest when you run it. The only glitch I had here was that the .conf file was not automatically created for me. I had to make the file and add the first feed address in there. But, simple enough if you can read directions and follow them.<br /><br />Armangil&#039;s Podcatcher (http://podcatcher.rubyforge.org/) is a very old tool. But, it is actively developed and therefore I would guess it has great features. I have not used this, but it has gotten good reviews. Apparently it runs on a Ruby framework.<br /><br />There is also Amarok. It is great if you are just listening on your computer. You can subscribe to feeds and it will keep you current as to what is available. But, I have not found a way (nor have I really looked) to make it download the shows. It just gets the RSS feed and lets you stream the show into Amarok. I am sure there has to be a way to download them.<br /><br />There are many more options out there. There are closed source programs for Linux from PodcastReady (http://podcastready.com/) and PodNova (http://www.podnova.com/index_for_listeners.srf) as well. But many people object to the fact that they are closed.<br /><br />Those are some ideas to help you get started. Please post discussion in this thread so that we can all benefit.</div>
