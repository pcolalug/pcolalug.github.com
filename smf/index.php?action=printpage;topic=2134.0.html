					Title: <b>SuSE Kernel Update</b><br />

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I just experienced a first. <br /><br />I've always dreaded running the major distros update utility when it came to an update to the kernel because I have an Nvidia video card installed. I've always had to download and reinstall the Nvidia drivers, then tweak them back to where I had them before the kernel update. <br /><br />Tonight, I got a notice from YOU (Yast Online Update) that there was an update to the Kernel. I gritted my teeth and told it to install the update. It downloaded the new kernel, installed it and recommended I reboot. So, with eyes closed tight, I rebooted the system. Well, when it went to start X I saw the familiar NVidia Logo.(I had my eyes open by this time) At that point my heart, and nerves, jumped for joy. It finally looks like a distro is starting to get kernel upgrades seemless. <br /><br />After that, i just had to let everyone know. (One more reason I don't regret switching from Mandrake) &nbsp; :D <br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Wow...I wonder if Debian has figured that out yet. It's been so long since I have run X on any distro.</div>
