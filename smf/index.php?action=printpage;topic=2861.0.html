					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well I have finally moved up in the world from Redhat 7.2 to now running Slack 10.2 with hand rolled (With the immense help from Lloyd) 2.6.16-11 kernel.<br />Atheros is working and sound so far`so good.<br />Install was really fast and the first night I actually recompiled the kernel about 6 times before finally settling with what i wanted in it and what I wanted it to do.<br />boots in about 39-43 seconds to command prompt with dhcp not started with it started 69 seconds much nicer than the original boot.<br />The only thing I don&#039;t like is the fact that my usb mouse and thumbdrives do not automatically setup and ready to go when I plug them in like Fedora did.<br />But oh well , Something to work on.....Got all my tools loaded nessus,nagios,ethereal,tcpdump,kismet,fish,tripwire and snort all working.<br /><br />Now my OpenBSD 3.9 disk I broke down and bought with real money go figure ...<br />I will be installing it now with the lastest kernel wow.........Welcome to the here and now Brett<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Brett, If your using a laptop with that atheros chipset, I&#039;d highly recommend ubuntu to you, as it supports the whole wifi shebang right out of the box.<br /><br />Not to knock slackware though, its just about the only distro that I can live with for long periods of time.<br /><br />Pre-orders are being taken for slack 11, and while I&#039;m not about to pay money to get slackware two weeks later than I coulda got it off bittorrent, I am seriously thinking about getting one of those stylish slackware hats.<br />(http://store.slackware.com/images/ss/slackcap.gif)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Meh sry, mis-read that part, thought he was still having trouble.&nbsp; Ubuntu&#039;s wifi setup is really fast and easy compared to all of the manual configuration you have to do with other distros.<br /><br />From my experience setting up wifi in slack is kinda touch and go.&nbsp; I will say that I *greatly* prefer the madwifi driver over the conexiant ndis driver.&nbsp; At least with the madwifi you don&#039;t end up fighting with with third party software that &#039;tries&#039; to autoconfigure you onto the network, but often fails miseribly.<br /><br />Also, I don&#039;t know what the deal is with dhcp and wifi, but for some reason it increases boot time *insanely* in slackware.&nbsp; I think with a little tweaking, maybe you could get the wifi setting up concurrently with the rest of the boot.</div>
