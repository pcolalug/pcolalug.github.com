					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">We all know how those unwashed gentoo hordes are aways raving about the speed up you get from compiling software for your specific arch.<br /><br />Well, I ran across an optimized build of firefox called swiftfox.&nbsp; It&#039;s built off the same source as the standard release, and all the extensions I&#039;ve tried work as well on it as they do on firefox.&nbsp; You can find it http://getswiftfox.com/<br /><br />Let me know if you notice any real speedup.&nbsp; I have, but that could just be suggestibility talking<br /><br />Brent</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Err oops, apparently, it&#039;s an optimized build for *ubuntu*&nbsp; :-[ though it doesn&#039;t say anywhere on the website.<br /><br />I figured that out after I went back and installed slackware today.&nbsp; You know, it&#039;s funny though, in ubuntu, normal firefox took about 10 seconds to load and render slashdot.&nbsp; Swiftfox did it in 4 seconds.&nbsp; Today, I timed firefox in slackware under fluxbox.&nbsp; My time? 4 seconds!&nbsp; Go figure.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Where did you get that it was optimized for ubuntu? I just installed the 1.8.0 branch for athlon-xp on my Debian Unstable box and it&#039;s rockin&#039;. I didn&#039;t think it would make much of a difference, but this build is amazingly fast. Took about 3 seconds to resolve, download and render slashdot for me. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It is NOT only for Ubuntu...&nbsp; I don&#039;t see any noticeable difference between it and regular Firefox.&nbsp; This is on a Slackware system, a Mandriva box, and a Ubuntu box.<br /><br />To be fair, I&#039;ve tweaked my &quot;regular&quot; Firefox a little.&nbsp; If you didn&#039;t know about this, open up &quot;about:config&quot; in Firefox, and scroll down to &quot;network.http.pipelining&quot; (and similar settings in that area).&nbsp; I&#039;ll leave it as an exercise for the reader as to what to do once you&#039;re there...&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />It makes quite a difference on most pages.<br /><br />Dan<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok, perhaps it was my goof.&nbsp; When I tried running it in slackware it complained of a pango-cario dependency.&nbsp; As long as you have that installed, you should be fine.&nbsp; However, it is NOT part of the default slack install, so I&#039;m guessing you&#039;d need gnome to satisfy it.<br /><br />As I previously reported though, firefox was just as fast on slackware as swiftfox was on ubuntu so it may mainly be useful for the more heavyweight binary distros.<br /><br />Also, regarding the net tweaks, there&#039;s a extension out now called fasterfox which will change all those net speed settings for you.&nbsp; I recommend setting it to one above normal, as the highest setting actually seemed to slow things down for me.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I was running fasterfox and found it still to be slower than swiftfox. On Debian, binaries are compiled with i386 optimization. I was using swiftfox for athlon-xp (I have an Athlon64 in 32 bit mode). Once again, I notice a <i>huge</i> difference.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">So here we are a month and a half later. Anyone still using this? Did it get an upgrade last week when Firefox did? Is there really any compelling reason to switch?<br /><br />If this is so good, why doesn&#039;t Firefox make these builds officially available?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m still using it. Stability is sometimes sketchy, but it is faster. It&#039;s updated quite frequently (several times a week). I&#039;m using the 1.8 branch myself.</div>
