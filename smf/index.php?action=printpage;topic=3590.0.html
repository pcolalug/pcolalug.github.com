					Title: <b>Proposal for change of LUG structure</b><br />
					Post by: <b>dpeach</b> on <b>October 14, 2009, 04:50:52 pm</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">There was a proposal by bhoff a few days ago for a change of structure in the LUG. While bhoff suggested that there may not be enough of an interest locally to support a monthly meeting, I want to propose a change of direction as opposed to an absolution of the group. I am quite supportive of the idea to change direction. As you read through this please do not read this as a mandate from the President. I have purposely held off from spewing my ideas until someone else brought it up.<br /><br />Even if we move to an on-line presence as opposed to physical meetings, I think we still need a set of officers. There needs to be at least 2 or 3 people who are guiding this ship. We need to have moderators for the forums and a couple of people who feel responsible to keep some discussion moving and promote whatever events might come up.<br /><br />My proposed officer structure would look something like this.<br /><br />President (though another name would be better), would be the person that just generally kept peace among the tribe. He would be responsible to promote any events that come up and would be the contact person for anyone wanting information about the group or have the group&#039;s involvement in an event. Maybe we could call the three officers that I am proposing Captain, Engineer and First Officer. Or something equally geeky; i.e., Ford Prefect, Arthur Dent and Zaphod Beeblebrox. The President could be Arthur Dent, the guy who thinks he knows what is going on, but lives in constant confusion.<br /><br />Sys-Admin (Engineer/Ford Prefect) would be the person that makes sure the site is up and running. This responsibility could (and probably should) be shared with one other person (First Officer). We need someone who will keep the forum upgraded and any other web presence we want to have. I envision some type of interactive community that would involve more than just a forum. I think some people fall away from the group because they feel like they can&#039;t make it to the meetings and therefore just are not active in any way on-line. When, in reality, if the LUG were a web based group only, then they would be more inclined to take part. Ford Prefect, the real brains behind everything going on.<br /><br />First Officer/Zaphod (the guy with the real power, but needs someone to slap him around occasionally to make sure his head is still screwed on). I don&#039;t know a good title for this person, nor really a good job description. But I think having a third person that can just be a sounding board for the group is wise and will keep this from becoming a one-man show. This could be the second web admin. He could also serve as just the voice of reason in any discussions (maybe Zaphod is a poor choice).<br /><br />This would allow people who are not right here in Pensacola feel like they are just as much part of the group as anyone else. While having quarterly meetings can be cool, this should not be the focus. I think we have lost some of our appeal when we started really making a push to be at the meetings when we originally defined a member as someone who was active on our forums. Coming to a meeting was just fun, not something that you needed to do.<br /><br />There are events that we as a group can participate in even though we don&#039;t get together on a monthly basis. The Nerd Invasion that is coming up is a great example of this. There is no reason that we need to be a group of people who get together monthly to be able to pull off an Install Fest for an event like this.<br /><br />I have talked with people who are avid Linux users here in Pensacola and in Mobile whom I knew would never make it to a meeting. I have even fallen into the trap of pushing them to come to at least one meeting when they could get all the benefit from just being a part of our forum. I tended to play down the forum in those situations when I really should have been pushing the people to the forum as a first introduction to the group.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if just a forum is enough of a presence any more though. It seems like the forum idea is a bit too static. But when you have so few members, trying to catch others on-line at any given time can be difficult. Does anyone else have an idea for other things we can do to have an on-line community? I can imagine a podcast that would have a central format as part of the group, but anyone could record content and toss it over to our sys-admin to upload it. That way no single person has to feel like they have to do all the work, but any person could record an interview with a Linux big-wig (or wannabe). Or, if you find some neat tip to some software you can explain it in an audio, video or screenie type recording and toss it into the feed. This would appeal to people way outside of the Pensacola area, but still tie the content to our group.<br /><br />I don&#039;t mind being the President who saw the collapse of the group as we know it. I have been part of the group since meeting number 2. I am really excited about seeing a change of direction for the group. It may also be that it is time for the group to go the way of the do-do bird.<br /><br />What think?<br /><br />Do we want to postpone the elections tomorrow night for another month? I think at this point all the by-laws are being trampled upon. If anyone has a problem with the anarchy that I am creating right now, please speak up. We can go back to the original plan. But if we can leave this open for discussion, then I think we can hammer out something very nice.<br /><br />I will be in Tennessee tomorrow night during the meeting, but if someone wanted to put me on speaker phone when you discuss all of this, I should be available for a call.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know the answer to all my questions, but I do know at least 1 answer: 42.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I plan on showing up tonight for the LUG meeting, though I may be a little late.&nbsp; Hopefully others will show up as well and we can further discuss it there.<br /><br />I personally like the idea of keeping the LUG as it is now, but having less-frequent meetings.&nbsp; Possibly one every other month.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I like the idea of quarterly meetings. January, April, July, October. That would also have time away from meetings during the busy holiday months and get back together after the first of year.<br /><br />As far as name for president. What about director? </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If we leave the structure as it is with less frequent meetings then we can keep the officer structure the same too. No needto change anything in the steering committee. Just need the new officers to make the changes as necessary going forward.&nbsp; </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I was a bit late for the meeting tonight (half an hour), didn&#039;t see anyone there.&nbsp; Quarterly&nbsp; meetings sound practical, and maybe a push for some impromptu meetings in between?&nbsp; I for one wouldn&#039;t mind fiing up my grill on a nice weekend and hosting a small eat and chat, perhaps others could offer the same some times?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I was there for about 20 minutes.&nbsp; If I&#039;d known you were coming I&#039;d have stayed a bit longer.</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It sounds like there is enough interest in keeping the meetings going even if the frequency is altered. In that case, I think we should stick with the current Steering Committee structure.<br /><br />Now we need to do an election to turn this ship over to the next crew.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yes.&nbsp; I propose the elections just take place online.&nbsp; I doubt that anyone&#039;s going to care about the lack of a &quot;secret ballot&quot; system.</div>
