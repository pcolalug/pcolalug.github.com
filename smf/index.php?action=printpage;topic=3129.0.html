					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Has anyone experimented with Mono on Linux or Unix?&nbsp; If so, what were your impressions?<br /><br />A couple of related articles:<br /><br />http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page<br /><br />http://www.linux-watch.com/news/NS5656359853.html<br /><br />Sounds interesting.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Have you used Java?<br /><br />The whole .NET thing is sort of the same thing. The major difference is that you can write your app in one of several languages, the most popular being C#. When you compile the source, it is translated into the Common Runtime Language and then compiled to bytecode. The bytecode, like in Java, is then handled by a Just-In-Time compiler which is platform specific. Microsoft has their official .NET JIT compiler in the form of the .NET Framework, just like Sun has the Sun Java 2 Standard/Enterprise/etc Edition Runtime Environment. Mono is attempting to bring the standard libraries of the MS .NET Framework, as well as some additional libraries, with their own JIT compiler, much like the various third part Java Runtime Environments from GNU, IBM, etc.<br /><br />So the idea is that you can write an app that uses the supported libraries in Mono and run that app in Linux, Solaris, Windows, Mac OS X, etc, and use any of the Mono supported languages, C# being the primary one at this point. The idea is that you can bring any other language to the framework provided you provide translations to the common runtime language.<br /><br />My impression of it is that the libraries are expansive. The classes have too many properties and methods to remember all but the most common, so you&#039;ll likely be doing a lot of reference searches for a while. This is true of anything .NET. I&#039;ve never become a fan, but I&#039;m not a developer. I know folks that love the .NET stuff. I know Java guys that find things in .NET &quot;interesting&quot;, but nothing especially new or exciting. Generally, the focus is different with the Java crowd. I wish I could tell you more, but my experience with it is very limited because I was turned off by it. <br /><br />If you&#039;ve ever used Beagle, F-Spot, Tomboy notes, or Blam RSS Reader, you&#039;ve used a Mono app.</div>
