					Post by: <b>rburt3</b> on <b>May 04, 2004, 10:17:11 pm</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The Steering Committee shall consist of five officers, nominated via the forums and elected by simple majority by the general membership of the Pensacola LUG. <br /><br />Nominations shall be accepted from the first of September until the Friday before the September general meeting. All votes shall be cast in person at the September general meeting. &nbsp;A nominee need not be present at the general meeting to be elected. Newly elected officers will begin their duties on October 1st, following the elections.<br /><br />The committee has the right to request that a position be added to the committee. If the group as a whole approves, by simple majority vote, then an election will be held for the new position at the earliest possible time. The committee can also call for a reduction in offices, via a method to be determined. <br />&nbsp;<br />Each position will be up for election in September, regardless of time served by the incumbent. <br /><br />There are no term limits. In the event that an officer can no longer fulfill their duties, current members of the Steering Committee will be elevated in position to fill the void. A special election will be held at the next general meeting to fill the position(s) remaining vacant.<br />&nbsp;<br />Additionally, a unanimous vote of the members of the committee may call for a re-election of any office. This gives the committee very limited control over its membership. <br />&nbsp;<br />The web master and Vice President are the only persons to have admin privileges on the forums. This does not exclude anyone else from filling moderator rolls in individual forums. The Librarian would have admin privileges to the Library forum only. The Secretary will have posting privileges on the Announcements forum and have the responsibility for keeping the membership informed on club happenings. <br />&nbsp;<br />The responsibilities of the committee as a whole will include: <br />&nbsp;1. Public relations and publicity <br />&nbsp;2. Ensuring that issues raised, either in the forums or through other means are addressed in a timely manner <br />&nbsp;3. Recruiting <br />&nbsp;4. Ensuring that meetings run smoothly and efficiently <br />&nbsp;5. Ensure that the mission of the group is manifest through our activities <br />&nbsp;6. Ensure that persons posting to the forums are treated with respect and that each question receives feedback in a professional and non-condescending manner, regardless of complexity or platform. <br />&nbsp;7. Others to be determined</div>
