					Title: <b>Hugin - a Panorama Stitcher</b><br />
					Post by: <b>green_dragon37</b> on <b>December 18, 2009, 03:26:33 pm</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">After a recent trip to Kentucky, in which I put my digital camera in to its &#039;panorama assist&#039; mode and set up in a couple locations for some photos, I was looking for some software to stitch together the resulting images.&nbsp; Up until now I had been using Arcsoft&#039;s Panorama Maker, but it&#039;s a Windows tool, and I couldn&#039;t find my CD for it.&nbsp; I fired up Synaptic, and just searched for &#039;panorama.&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp;The only 3 results were libpano -- the Panorama Tools Library and CLI Tools, Hugin -- a frontend to libpano, and Pandora -- a GIMP plugin which I didn&#039;t even bother installing, based purely on its description.&nbsp; Clearly there wasn&#039;t much competition, so I was somewhat disappointed and had a rather dim outlook on the results I would get from Hugin.&nbsp; I was surprised, to say the least.<br /><br />When you first start the program, you&#039;re greeted with a very nondescript screen where the only active button is &#039;Load Images...&#039;&nbsp; Point it at a set of images, and it goes to work in a fully automatic mode, comparing each image to every other image you&#039;ve selected, and generating sets of points in each image that correspond to points in other images.&nbsp; After a few minutes (have coffee handy) the program presents you with a &#039;rough draft&#039; preview of all the hard work it has done.&nbsp; In my case, of the 2 sets of images I loaded in to it, it got one mostly right, and one mostly wrong.&nbsp; After this step has completed, though, you can go back and fine-tune the points created to have the images line up properly, or in some cases, create the points from scratch to get them to appear in the final product at all!<br /><br />After I got all the points where I wanted to, I told it to re-optimize the image, and the program stitched them together again and gave me a preview.&nbsp; Now, the preview doesn&#039;t show you anything near what the final product would look like, since it shows just the stitching, and not the blending/post-processing it does to the image to make it look nice, so don&#039;t worry if it looks terrible, just focus on whether or not everything is lined up properly.&nbsp; With the preview window up, you can adjust the horizon, and choose different projections for the image to show as.&nbsp; Play with these, they will give you a sense of what can be done with the program.<br /><br />The resulting generated image is a huge uncompressed TIFF image, uncropped.&nbsp; The program itself will not crop it down for you, so after getting it how I liked, I imported it in to the GIMP, cropped it, adjusted contrast/color/brightness, and saved it as a humble JPEG, which I have linked below for you to examine.<br /><br />Not only can you do simple horizontal or vertical stitched images, but you can do a large grid if you wanted to, say 3x3 images, or 5x5, or as many as your computer will handle without catching fire!&nbsp; The things you can do with this program are quite nice!&nbsp; I give it a solid two thumbs up.<br /><br />Ian<br /><br />Resulting Image: http://aj4ar.org/img/ky-2009-11-a.jpg<br />Hugin: http://hugin.sourceforge.net<br />Tutorials: http://hugin.sourceforge.net/tutorials/</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Cool work!&nbsp; To my totally untrained eye the &quot;stitching&quot; appears seamless.<br /><br />sandspur<br />living and dying in runlevel three</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That looks great. I will have to look into that sometime. I have been interested in doing some of those gigabit pictures.</div>
