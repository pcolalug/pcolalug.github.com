					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I got an email this weekend from the Northwest Florida Association of Computer User Groups (http://nwfacug.org/) talking about their upcoming annual one day training program in Niceville. It will be January 23. We had a representative (mall0ry) go over last year and set up a table and share some things about Linux. This is not a Linux only event, but general computing. Their main goal is to help promote home computing. This is not targeted to big workplace installations, but helping the average user learn about different aspects of multi-media, gaming, homework, home networking type of computing.<br /><br />Here are the relevant parts of the email I got from them this weekend:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Hi David,<br />....This is your invite to give a presentation at our annual one day computer training program at Northwest Florida State College, Niceville, FL on Jan 23, 2010. The 2010 event is named “Computer Tech ’10”. This event is free and opened to the public. Sponsors are the Northwest Florida State College (NWFSC) Prime Time and the Northwest Florida Association of Computer User Groups (NWFACUG). Vendors are welcome to attend and setup a free venders table. <br /><br />This is our fourth year of providing the home computer user an opportunity to learn new computer skills from the best instructors in this area. Attendees will have a choice of 22 different subjects to choose from. At our last event 270 computer users attended plus a number of computer vendors.... Please visit our web site http://nwfacug.org/default.htm to get a better idea of who we are and what we do. <br /><br />We will provide each presenter a class room with a projector and internet connection for PowerPoints and live demos. We post all presentation on the NWFACUG web site after the event. Handouts are left up to the individual presenter. <br /><br />.... Send your subject as soon as possible to avoid duplication.<br /></div><br />Can we get a couple of people to commit to putting together a presentation? I know this is a ways off, but if we can get someone in promoting some of the cool and useful things about Linux, that would be great. If I went (which I can&#039;t because I will be out of the country by then), I would focus on some application. My application of choice would be OpenOffice.org. While it is not Linux specific, I would present on a Linux machine.<br /><br />What can you present? I think it would be good to have 2 options to suggest to the event and let them choose one or both. I would like to let him know about a possible presenter by the end of the September meeting which is September 18.<br /><br />Please discuss.</div>
