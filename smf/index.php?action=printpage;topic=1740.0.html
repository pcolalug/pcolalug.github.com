(Nasdaq: SUNW - News), the creator and leading advocate of Java(TM) technology, today underscored its commitment to open source and desktop technology leadership by contributing Project Looking Glass and Java 3D(TM) technology to the open source community. This contribution will unleash a new dimension of developer innovation by making Sun's cutting edge technology available at Sun's 3D Desktop Technology Open Source Project on java.net.<br /></div><br /><br />I've been using Sun Java Desktop since it's release, and will try to get Looking Glass installed to show off at the next meeting.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I honestly can't see the major advantage this has over our current solution other than it being pretty. What is the difference between minimizing a window, or putting it in shade mode and turning the window on it's side? Cool, yes...big improvement, I don't know.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I feel ya, ruggy, but anything that has the possibility of shaking us out of our current taskbar/window/applet/dock paradigm is good (ok, yes 3-DD has all of those things I mention, but its something...).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don't know if you all watched the demo video on the web site but there are all kinds of advantages of Sun's solution over current desktops. Two of the biggies I liked are the ability to flip windows around and make notes on the back. For example, if you get to a web page you like, flip the window around and make a not on the back. Later you can search through your notes which are already attached to the web pages. The other feature is the ability to tilt windows on the side of the screen. With the current &quot;flat&quot; appearance I find myself basically using one window and then flipping between tabs or windows when doing research, compareing pages, or writing papers based on other douments. With the ability to use 3D depth I can tild two windows on the side, continue to read them and do all of my writing on the page in the middle. <br /><br />These are two fantastic features I liked right off the bat. I'm willing to bet if you use this desktop on a regular basis, you'll find other things you can do with it to your benefit.<br /><br />Also, during the video demo, the presenter talked about not so much the fact that this is a 3D desktop as this is the begining of us breaking out of the MS way of doing things. Microsoft has in affect locked us into a way of thinking and they are not willing to break down the barriers t explor new ways of thinking. By doing this they have impacted not just the Windows world but the Linux and Apple world. Everybody expects their desktop to resemble the look and feel of Windows. (I don't mean the exact theme, just the way of seeing and using the desktop) Sun is working on breaking through this box that MS has put us in and opening it up.<br /><br />If they release this for Linux, I'll definetly give it a shot. I may end up going back to the KDE/Gnome/Windows way of seeing my dekstop but at least I'll have tried out another unique desktop....<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It's out for Linux. &nbsp;I've installed it under Linspire, Sun JDS, Fedora 2, and Slackware 10. &nbsp;Seems happy everywhere. &nbsp;<br /><br />As you could have probably guessed, it works better on some platforms than others, but is buggy everywhere. &nbsp;I'm not gonna comlain, it's the first beta release and not even intended for anything but development testing right now.<br /><br />But it is very cool. &nbsp;Tilting windows back out of the way and still seeing their contents is very nice. &nbsp;<br /><br />It's not very useful yet until it gets more stable and they get all the native X apps working with it. &nbsp;Some of the native X apps I used under JDS are happy, but almost nothing under Fedora would render correctly. &nbsp;Gaim worked okay under Fedora, but Mozilla wouldn't render.<br /><br />It runs in two modes, in a nested X window for development (only native 3D ready apps will run here) or as a full-screen environment to replace Gnome / KDE (in which any X app will -eventually- run.) &nbsp;I didn't have any stability problems running in development mode, but in full-screen mode on my laptop the keyboard / mouse stop responding so I went through many hard-boots. &nbsp;But it worked fine on my desktop. &nbsp;YMMV.<br /><br />Anyone want to try it? &nbsp;Here's the instructions, a few downloads to make, and registering at the java development site, and once you have the files takes less than 5 minutes to install everything. &nbsp;The dev site looks kind of like sourceforge, has file repositories, project homepages, forums, etc.<br /><br />It is open source, so if something is buggy on your system you can get the sources and recompile specific for your distro. &nbsp;The only problem is all the developers are out of town at the Sun Conference, then supposedly will all be on vacation next week. &nbsp; So don't expect much help until after that.<br /><br />homepage: https://lg3d-core.dev.java.net<br /><br />instructions: https://lg3d-core.dev.java.net/lg3dgettingstarted.html<br /><br />Good luck,<br /><br />Nick</div>
