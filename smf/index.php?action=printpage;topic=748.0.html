					Post by: <b>imnes</b> on <b>June 04, 2003, 05:03:12 pm</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Anyone else following the whole SCO vs anything-linux story? &nbsp;<br /><br />The whole thing is SCO is suing IBM because they supposedly leaked proprietary code that got used in the linux kernel or other linux applications. &nbsp;Supposedly SCO has proof, but they haven't provided it yet. &nbsp;I think the suit against IBM is a little over $1B. &nbsp;<br /><br />From what I have read, SCO has completely suspended their linux program. &nbsp;<br /><br />Excerpt from their own product page:<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote"><br />The sale of this SCO Linux product to new customers is currently suspended due to intellectual property (IP) issues associated with the Linux operating system. Accordingly, SCO has announced the suspension of its own Linux activities until the issues surrounding Linux IP and the attendant risks are better understood and properly resolved.<br /></div><br />http://www.sco.com/products/server/<br /><br />I'm not sure what this is all about, but about a month or so ago Microsoft signed a deal with SCO to license UNIX source code and patents. &nbsp;<br />http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2003/0519mssco.html<br /><br />In addition to the suit against IBM, SCO sent notice to some 1,500 other Linux / UNIX related vendors. &nbsp;Novell responded with this letter<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote"><br />Mr. Darl McBride <br />President and CEO<br />The SCO Group<br /><br />Re: SCO's &quot;Letter to Linux Customers&quot;<br /><br />Dear Darl:<br /><br />As you know, Novell recently announced some important Linux initiatives. These include an upcoming NetWare version based on the Linux kernel, as well as collaboration and resource management solutions for Linux.<br /><br />Put simply, Novell is an ardent supporter of Linux and the open source development community. This support will increase over time.<br /><br />It was in this context that we recently received your &quot;Letter to Linux Customers.&quot; Many Novell business partners and customers apparently received the same letter. Your letter compels a response from Novell.<br /><br />As we understand the letter, SCO alleges that unnamed entities incorporated SCO's intellectual property into Linux without its authorization. You apparently base this allegation on a belief that these unnamed entities copied some UNIX System V code into Linux. Beyond this limited understanding, we have been unable to glean any further information about your allegation because of your letter's vagueness.<br /><br />In particular, the letter leaves certain critical questions unanswered. What specific code was copied from UNIX System V? Where can we find this code in Linux? Who copied this code? Why does this alleged copying infringe SCO's intellectual property? By failing to address these important questions, SCO has failed to put us on meaningful notice of any allegedly infringing Linux code, and thus has withheld from us the ability - and removed any corresponding obligation - to address your allegation.<br /><br />As best we can determine, the vagueness about your allegation is intentional. In response to industry demands that you be more specific, you attempt to justify your vagueness by stating, &quot;That's like saying, 'show us the fingerprints on the gun so you can rub them off.'&quot; (Wall Street Journal, May 19, 2003) Your analogy is weak and inappropriate. Linux has existed for over a decade, and there are plenty of copies in the marketplace with which SCO could attempt to prove its allegation.<br /><br />We are aware that you recently offered to disclose some of the alleged Linux problems to Novell and others under a nondisclosure agreement. If your offer is sincere, it may be a step in the right direction. But we wonder whether the terms of the nondisclosure agreement will allow Novell and others in the Linux community to replace any offending code. Specifically, how can we maintain the confidentiality of the disclosure if it is to serve as the basis for modifying an open source product such as Linux? And if we cannot use the confidential disclosure to modify Linux, what purpose does it serve?<br /><br />In your letter, you analogize SCO's campaign against the Linux community to that of the record industry against major corporations whose servers contained downloaded music files. There are crucial differences between the two campaigns. The record industry has provided specific information to back up its allegation, while SCO steadfastly refuses to do so. In its allegation letter, the record industry provides evidence of allegedly infringing activity that is specific to the targeted company. This offers the company real notice of the activity, sufficient information to evaluate the allegation, and an opportunity to stop the activity if it determines the allegation is true. If SCO wants to compare its actions to those of the record industry, it should follow the example set by that industry and present specific evidence of the alleged infringement.<br /><br />SCO claims it has specific evidence supporting its allegation against the Linux community. It is time to substantiate that claim, or recant the sweeping and unsupported allegation made in your letter. Absent such action, it will be apparent to all that SCO's true intent is to sow fear, uncertainty, and doubt about Linux in order to extort payments from Linux distributors and users.<br /><br />This true intent becomes clearer when one considers various public statements you and other SCO personnel have made about SCO's intellectual property rights in UNIX. SCO continues to say that it owns the UNIX System V patents, yet it must know that it does not. A simple review of U.S. Patent Office records reveals that Novell owns those patents.<br /><br />Importantly, and contrary to SCO's assertions, SCO is not the owner of the UNIX copyrights. Not only would a quick check of U.S. Copyright Office records reveal this fact, but a review of the asset transfer agreement between Novell and SCO confirms it. To Novell's knowledge, the 1995 agreement governing SCO's purchase of UNIX from Novell does not convey to SCO the associated copyrights. We believe it unlikely that SCO can demonstrate that it has any ownership interest whatsoever in those copyrights. Apparently, you share this view, since over the last few months you have repeatedly asked Novell to transfer the copyrights to SCO, requests that Novell has rejected. Finally, we find it telling that SCO failed to assert a claim for copyright or patent infringement against IBM. <br /><br />SCO's actions are disrupting business relations that might otherwise form at a critical time among partners around Linux technologies, and are depriving these partners of important economic opportunities. We hope you understand the potential significant legal liability SCO faces for the possible harm it is causing to countless customers, developers, and other Linux community members. SCO's actions, if carried forward, will lead to the loss of sales and jobs, delayed projects, canceled financing, and a balkanized Linux community.<br /><br />We, like others, are concerned about the direction of SCO's campaign. For now, we demand that SCO either promptly state its Linux infringement allegations with specificity or recant the accusation made in your letter. Further, we demand that SCO retract its false and unsupported assertions of ownership in UNIX patents and copyrights or provide us with conclusive information regarding SCO's ownership claims. In the future, we hope SCO will adhere to standards of strict accuracy when stating its rights in UNIX.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Jack L. Messman<br />Chairman, President and CEO<br /></div><br />http://www.novell.com/news/press/archive/2003/05/pr03033.html<br /><br />Linux users in general are upset and showing it in their own ways. &nbsp;The linux iso site LinuxDistro.org pulled the Caldera ISOs from their site with a message <br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote"><br />Goodbye Caldera, thanks for being jerks.:<br />It's official, as of May 14th, Caldera has suspended their Linux sales. Apparently they are switching their revenue model from selling Linux to suing people who use Linux. I have removed their link from our site and would on behalf of linuxiso.org and its users say 'Thanks for being such perfidious finks.' <br />--Lance <br /></div><br />http://www.linuxiso.org/news.php#79<br /><br />Also, apparently Linux is huge over in Europe, and especially Germany. &nbsp;SCO was forced (by a court-order) to shut down their german website and remove any references to Linux. <br />http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/os/linux/story/0,10801,81784,00.html<br />http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/os/linux/story/0,10801,81607,00.html<br /><br /><br />If nothing else, this is an interesting story to follow. &nbsp;If somehow SCO manages to but a stranglehold on Linux, I'll just pop in my FreeBSD CD and keep going. &nbsp;Not to worry though, Linux was around before big companies got involved, it will probably still be around long after :)<br /><br />If anyone spots any new info, respond here so we can know about it.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: imnes</div><div class="quote">Anyone else following the whole SCO vs anything-linux story?</div><br />Oh yeah. I loooove a good drama. This mess is worse than a soap opera!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: imnes</div><div class="quote">I'm not sure what this is all about, but about a month or so ago Microsoft signed a deal with SCO to license UNIX source code and patents.</div><br />As much as I love a good conspiracy theory, I really can't buy into the &quot;M$ is behind every threat to Linux and is backing SCO to tarnish the reputation and credibility of OSS&quot; as much anymore. If looked at from a business perspective, this move probably makes more sense. See, Microsoft sells a (critically acclaimed, I might add) middleware product that allows Unix and Windows systems to inter-operate. I can imagine MS execs analysing the situation and coming up with alternatives:<br /><br />1. ignore the issue and wait to be sued by SCO for their middleware.<br />2. buy SCO (many folks think this is why SCO began this whole mess in the first place)<br />3. pay the (to MS, anyway) pocket change for SCO licensing and move on.<br /><br />The truth is probably that 3 was the cheapest solution. Its not like MS doesn't have this kind of cash just laying around.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: imnes</div><div class="quote">In addition to the suit against IBM, SCO sent notice to some 1,500 other Linux / UNIX related vendors. &nbsp;Novell responded with this letter ...</div><br />And SCO is suing Novell now too because of that very letter!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: imnes</div><div class="quote">Also, apparently Linux is huge over in Europe, and especially Germany. &nbsp;SCO was forced (by a court-order) to shut down their german website and remove any references to Linux.</div><br />It was interesting to note how, when this mess started a month or two ago, SuSE was quick to rebuke their (former) UnitedLinux partner. That whole consortium is pissed at SCO for these shenanigans. However, UnitedLinux is committed to moving forward from everything I've read (SuSE has stated it would be no trouble at all to make up for the loss of SCO. Whether that is a testiment to SuSE's capabilities or a indictment of SCO's minimal contribution is left as an excersize for the reader...).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: imnes</div><div class="quote">If nothing else, this is an interesting story to follow. &nbsp;If somehow SCO manages to but a stranglehold on Linux, I'll just pop in my FreeBSD CD and keep going. &nbsp;Not to worry though, Linux was around before big companies got involved, it will probably still be around long after :)</div><br />Don't be too terribly concerned about having to ditch your Linux boxen any time soon, folks. Analysts, big businesses, OSS pundents, and others seem to think this is all one big snow job. And, even if SCO wins all of its court cases, this is the power of OSS: we'll all have an unencumbered version of Linux before you can read the fallout on Slashdot.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: imnes</div><div class="quote">If anyone spots any new info, respond here so we can know about it.</div><br />http://slashdot.org usually has some updates on this debacle every other day or so, if you are interested in following the case.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">(Somehow, I feel that I just have to comment on this thread. :P)<br /><br />SCO isn't interested in 'working with the community' or anything of the like to resolve problems. &nbsp;They're just interested in suing.<br /><br />What you're seeing is a company that is looking to hike it's stock price up as high as possible, and what better way to do that than to make a ruckus about lawsuits and buyouts and all.<br /><br />Do remember though, IBM /is/ the old Evil Empire after all.. &nbsp;And I just have a feeling that it's IBM who's going to be the one who ultimately says when this game is over.</div>

The article was mostly FUD, IMHO, but, as conspiracies go, it was a duzy. Basically, the author posits that if IBM settles out of court/buys SCO, they could then press their claims and be the only vendor capable of both selling and supporting Linux. &quot;Why doesn't SCO do that, then&quot;, you say? Basically, no matter what happens, SCO is dead as a company. IBM is the only player in this farce that has the infrastructure and capital to pull it off. Far fetched, maybe, but something to keep you up at night, nonetheless.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here is a slanted article written by John Dvorak (To think I used to admire this guy). My comment to the person that sent it to me is that I was happy to see John finally got his Law Degree.<br />The reason I'm brining it up is that he does make an interesting point about why Microsoft is most likely not involved in this law suit.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">I can't see Microsoft as part of any scheme at all, here. The company doesn't change its modus operandi that much. Microsoft would be more likely to use purchased Unix source code as a guide for making Unix incompatible with Windows or for finding ways to kill Unix performance or some such thing. That would be its version of a dirty trick. The other possibility is that Microsoft saw what was happening, knew that SCO would be strapped for cash, and realized that would be a good time to buy some needed technology cheap&#8212;perhaps a new TCP/IP stack it could actually understand, for example.</div><br /><br />Here's the article.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: imnes</div><div class="quote">Someone has to step in and stop this or otherwise, even if the suit turns up completely false and unfounded in 4 years or whenever it's resolved, the damage will have already been done.</div><br />And this is apparently what Redhat is doing. <br /><br />I don't doubt that there will be a smoking crater left where SCO's nasdaq listing was after IBM gets through with them. &nbsp;But the SCO vs. IBM trial isn't scheduled until sometime in 2005. So that means 2 years that SCO can continue to drag Linux through the mud. <br /><br />The general gist of the suit filed by Redhat is that they are telling SCO: &quot;Either show us what you've got or shut the hell up.&quot; &nbsp;So this could be a key turning point in the whole Linux-SCO fiasco, since SCO will be required to point out just what it is that infringes. &nbsp;One of two things can arise from this:<br /><br />1) There is no infringing code and the folks at SCO have just been talking out of their collective ass the whole time. &nbsp;End Result: The problem goes away completely, since SCO has nothing to further pursue in court (either with IBM or Linux users).<br /><br />2) There is some infringing code. Just what pieces infringe is something that SCO will have to make public, with no NDA or other legal strings attached. &nbsp;The offending code gets removed by the Linux community, and SCO can no longer pursue licenses from end-users, suing distro makers (such as Redhat, Mandrake, et. al) for damages, etc. &nbsp;It then becomes a matter strictly between IBM and SCO. <br /><br />In fact, SCO most likely won't be able to pursue damages from anyone. At all. &nbsp;They themselves still distribute the allegedly infringing Linux kernel sources under the GPL, and they have made no attempts to rectify the situation. &nbsp;This makes any damages worth exactly $0.00.<br /><br />Case in point, &nbsp;take a look at IBM-vs-SCO. &nbsp;This matter (and any other case involving SCO) will be pursued in a civil court, not a criminal court. &nbsp; And in a civil case, if there are damages, the plaintiff &nbsp;(SCO in this case) has to show that they have made due and diligent effort to either negate or minimize said damages as much as they can. This would entail that SCO would have to identify the infringing sections, so that they could be removed by Linux developers as soon as possible. &nbsp;They have not done this; ergo, they cannot collect damages.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: Imnes</div><div class="quote">What if they did win, and all of a sudden all linux users had to fork over $300 a copy to SCO to keep using their distro?</div><br /><br />Actually, SCO would like to charge you somewhere in the neighborhood of $699 to $1399 per CPU, according to this (http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/53/32187.html). &nbsp; Read the above, though. &nbsp;And if you don't pay up.. Well, they'll &nbsp;sue you. (http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/06/1060064230750.html)<br /><br />You might wish to consult some sort of legal counsel before purchasing a license from SCO. &nbsp;I'll go so far as to say SCO cannot license Linux like this; the GPL and whatever closed-source binary-only licensing scheme that SCO has in mind will be mutually incompatible with each other. &nbsp; Thus, SCO's licensing Linux in such a manner is probably illegal at the very least.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here is IBM's counter suit (http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,111932,00.asp).<br /><br />They are suing SCO based on a seperate set of issues. One of the biggest it infringement on the GPL. I don't really understand how this applies, but if it works, more power to them.<br /><br />Funny thing. I met a man today that works for IBM. He knows nothing of this. He is a consultant, but I don't know what field. He was totally clueless about the lawsuit and does not even know what Linux is. He worked for Price Waterhouse Coopers Consulting before IBM bought the consulting arm of PWC. Either he is really clueless or he is told to plead ignorance to the public.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, here's an update on the whole SCO situation, for those of you that haven't grown sick of this whole ordeal yet.<br /><br /><br />In this (http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=11031) article, SCO alleges that the GPL is invalid -- a claim that is complete (http://www.vnunet.com/News/1143076) and utter (http://news.zdnet.co.uk/0,39020330,39115793,00.htm) bull, according to the rest &nbsp;(http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/32393.html)of the world. &nbsp;SCO is relying upon a rather naive interpretation of copyright law, which will never stand up in court, and I'm fairly certain that SCO knows this. &nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />Both here (http://www.heise.de/newsticker/data/jk-19.08.03-000/imh0.jpg) and here (http://www.heise.de/newsticker/data/jk-19.08.03-000/imh1.jpg) are pictures of slides that were reportedly leaked from a recent SCO expo.<br /><br />The code shown does indeed come from Linux.. &nbsp;It's part of this (http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/marcelo/linux-2.4/arch/ia64/sn/io/ate_utils.c) file from the IA-64 branch. &nbsp; The first slide also shows a side-by-side comparison with some obscured System V code, to show that comments were lifted 'line-by-line' and put into Linux.<br /><br />This would seem like pretty damning evidence, and quite honestly, I would agree with such a sentiment. &nbsp;The exact same comments can be found in several other Unices, such as BSD 2.11 (http://unix-archive.pdp11.org.ru/PDP-11/Trees/2.11BSD/sys/sys/subr_rmap.c) from 1986. &nbsp;The routine itself is even older than this, coming from the original code (http://minnie.tuhs.org/UnixTree/V5/usr/sys/ken/malloc.c.html) written by none other Ken Thompson himself, circa 1973. &nbsp;In this 30-year period, said code has been reproduced in a number of academic (http://www.kill-9.it/jargon/html/entry/Lions-Book.html) texts, and is now in the public domain for all practical purposes.<br /><br />The second (http://www.heise.de/newsticker/data/jk-19.08.03-000/imh1.jpg) &nbsp;slide lacks a coresponding System V section for comparsion, but the problem with SCO using this as evidence is two-fold: &nbsp;First, this code is part of something that System V could *NEVER* do to begin with, and second: this code in question was contributed to the kernel by SGI, not IBM.<br /><br />So what's left: a piece of 30-year old public-domain code, and something else that wasn't even made or owned by SCO.<br /><br /><br />Sorry, SCO, but I call bollocks on this one.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><b>Apple in court dispute over Unix </b><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote"><br /><br />As legal battles heat up over who owns the rights to the Unix operating system, another dispute has been quietly simmering over the rights to the Unix name itself. <br />Apple Computer is being sued by The Open Group, the San Francisco company that claims ownership of the Unix trademark, for using the term Unix in conjunction with its Mac OS X operating system without a license. Apple has countersued, asking a judge to declare that the trademark is invalid, because the term Unix has become generic. <br /><br />Though initiated nearly 18 months ago, the case has not yet gone to trial. According to a motion filed with the court Tuesday, both companies want to have an exchange of factual documents completed by August, with a trial sought for February. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />This legal battle, though separate from SCO's recent claim that Linux uses copyrighted Unix source code, adds further fire to the debate over the custody of Unix--the 30 plus-year old OS originally developed by AT&amp;T. <br /><br />Despite SCO's acquisition, from Novell, of much of the intellectual property associated with Unix, the Unix name itself was transferred to The Open Group, which established a licensing program for the use of the name that includes software testing as well as a licensing fee, among other things. SCO and Novell are sparring over the extent of SCO's ownership of Unix, while SCO and IBM are embroiled in a trade-secrets lawsuit. <br /><br />The Open Group, also known as X/Open, sued Apple in December 2001 alleging, among other things, that Apple had infringed on its trademark. The case, filed in U.S. District Court in San Jose, Calif., has been wending its way through the courts, with the parties still in the discovery process. Months of mediation meetings ended without a settlement, according to The Open Group. <br /><br />Since introducing Mac OS X in March 2001, Apple has consistently touted the Unix underpinnings as part of its marketing of the operating system. Apple's Web site, for example, has a page devoted to the Unix base of the OS, including a logolike GIF that shows a metal plate bearing the words &quot;Unix Based.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;That's kind of the one that we are least fond of,&quot; said Open Group Chief Operating Officer Steve Nunn, who notes that the group has had a similar Unix license logo of its own for some time. <br /><br />The Open Group wants Apple to have Mac OS X undergo testing to certify that it complies with its standards for software bearing the Unix name; it also wants Apple to pay a fee. The Open Group says the costs to license the name are reasonable, based on the size of the company and the rough number of copies of the software Apple sells. In any case, no company is required to pay more than $110,000, said Graham Bird, vice president of marketing for The Open Group. <br /><br />&quot;Apple would be at the top of that range because they ship a lot of units,&quot; Bird said. &quot;It's not like we are talking about bankrupting the company.&quot; <br /><br />Apple argues it should be free to use the term as it sees fit, noting that there are many flavors of Unix, including FreeBSD, and that one should not have to submit to The Open Group's testing to use the term. <br /><br />&quot;Apple does not use the term Unix as a trademark in connection with Apple's product,&quot; the company said in court papers seen by CNET News.com. &quot;Apple accurately uses the generic term Unix merely to identify or describe an aspect or feature of Apple's Mac OS X operating system. This is consistent with past and current industry standards.&quot; <br /><br /><br /><br /></div><br /><br />http://news.com.com/2100-1016-1015814.html?tag=nl<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Not to stray too far, but your illustration with 1-2-3 and other such products is a good one. But not because the product was bad. The company that bought them out are the ones that dropped the ball. (Which is what has happened to Caldera).<br /><br />1-2-3 is one of my favorite illustrations of companies being really STUPID. IBM bought Lotus and destroyed a great product. Well, they did not really destory it, but they did nothing to improve it. 1-2-3 and the rest of the Lotus Smart Suite was a great product in 1997. And it still is a great product for then, but we are now 6 years later and they have essentially done nothing to improve. IBM has had their bout of stupidity for great products that they have acquired. They still pour the money into the advertisement and selling, but have done nothing to the products (OS/2 comes to mind).<br /><br />That was an illustration of a product that I loved being bought out by a stupid company.<br /><br />The other direction is a great company that has managed to show thier stupidity on products that they have acquired: Corel. Corel was set to take over the world between 95-98. Then they turned really dumb. Their flagship products CorelDraw and PhotoPaint, are still great products (though, since their inception, their even numbered releases give new features (most of which are broken) and their odd number releases fix all the problems. So if you decide to give any CorelSuite products a try, go for the odd numbers. It is funny on eBay the odd numbered releases will bring considerably more money than the evens).<br /><br />Ok, back to the issue. WordPerfect. It was a great product. But Corel had to go and be stupid with it. I personally never liked it, and probably never will give it a chance. But I have read and talk to users of WP and they would agree that it is still a good product, but Corel has done nothing to make it a great product. They are still riding on the laurels of WordPerfect for DOS. You don't make it in the future in this industry by sitting on 15 year old technology. What is scarey is Corel's propensity in the last 4 years to buy out anyone that even hints that they are looking to sell. I don't know where you could find the information, but you might be surprised as to how many companies Corel has bought out in the last few years. It would top more than 15 I am sure.<br /><br />So the problem is not the product (I personally liked Caldera Linux in it's day), but the company that wants to take a good product and do nothing with it. SCO will ultimately fail. Even if they win this suit, they don't have enough intelligence to know that you just need to hire a couple of good programmers and continue making good products.</div>
