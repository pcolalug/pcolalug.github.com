					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well guys I finally reached one of my goals.<br />I am now SANS GIAC certified professional. I passed my GCFA yesterday and now am able to do data recovery and forensics gathering for prosecution.<br />I am also now what they call an expert witness if I have to testify.<br /><br />Antler, Inc. my present employer was nice enough to pay for my sans boot camp and testing roughly $3,500.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Congratulations on your certification!<br /><br />For those of us who don&#039;t know much about the SANS GIAC, could you elaborate on some of the details?&nbsp; I take it you can now search hard drives for evidence in criminal cases, etc...?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks, And you would be partly correct.<br /><br />First GIAC stands for Global Information Assurance Certification they have maintained a set of standards for attaining and maintaining certifications for the different levels of IT.<br />&nbsp;Security Administration, Security Management, IT Audit and Software Security. Mine is in the Security Management GCFA which is GIAC Certified Forensics Analyst.<br />Which means now that I can perform a criminal investigation on the IT side And recover sensitive data that has been altered or deleted. I can also come in and with some degree of certainty <br />determine who did what and when. If called to testify I am also now an expert witness vs a Lay witness which means I can express my opinion. Where others can not.<br />It is a highly sought after certification ranking number 3 in the list of certs.<br /><br />Taking the test is pretty straight forward. 4 hours 150 questions open book......6 books +three tablets, 70% or better for silver cert. Also cost $750.00 for test that you have to re certify every 4 years.<br />The boot camp that my boss paid for cost $3,500 +testing and took 6 8 hour days to complete.<br /><br />Hope that gives some insight to what it is and what it give you.<br /></div>
