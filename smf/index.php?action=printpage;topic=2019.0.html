					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I tried this today, and it's quite cool. &nbsp;Had a bit of trouble figuring out how to configure the key bindings... &nbsp;it's in the &quot;autoexec.cfg&quot; file... &nbsp;The gameplay and graphics are a little primitive by today's big commercial game standards, but very decent. &nbsp;Reminds me quite a bit of the Quake look. &nbsp;I've played a couple of the Single Player maps, and haven't tried the Multiplayer yet...<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If there's an autoexec.cfg I think that's the quake engine it's running.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">As far as I remember they said it was their own engine, but they did keep there config file similar to Quake so that people could use it easier. I got cube running last night, and it said I was going at 25fps, but my screen was refreshing about every 5 seconds. Blasted old computer. I'm running a voodoo4 if that helps anyone tell me whats wrong.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Wow. &nbsp;That's actually kinda cool. &nbsp;Wish it was more popular but cool nonetheless. &nbsp;I like the idea behind it (outdoor engine indoors to the extreme), I wonder what would happen if I told Gabe over at Penny-Arcade about this. &nbsp;I e-mailed Tycho about Nexuiz but I know that's not exactly his style and thus did not appear on the news page.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Interesting, it didn't require a build or anything. &nbsp;While obviously dated in terms of graphics it reminds me a lot of Quake 3 in terms of speed and is surprisingly fun. &nbsp;Also having about 500fps or so is rather entertaining. &nbsp; :lol:</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've discovered, perhaps a bit later than everyone else, what makes this so interesting.<br /><br />Real-time in-game editing. &nbsp;You're just playing along and you hit, &quot;e,&quot; and suddenly you're editing the game in-game. &nbsp;No loading, no different interace, just immediately changes. &nbsp;That is the COOLEST d**n thing I've seen in a long time due to the utter and complete simplicity of it. &nbsp;What's more is that technically you can even do it during a multiplayer game. &nbsp;THAT'S amazing.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">A friend showed me this game a while ago for Windows. &nbsp;I thought is was hilarious running around punching people with the giant fist... :twisted:</div>
