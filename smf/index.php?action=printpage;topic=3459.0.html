					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Update!<br /><br />I have had a pain in the neck partitioning Vista as it puts a lock on you, But 98 gigs is enough for Linux :)<br />I have installed Ubuntu 8.10 64bit and it is running very well. I got Compiz running with the Emerald theme and I really like the 3d cube. Instead of getting into everything I have working I will&nbsp; narrow down to what is not working.<br />IR remote I am working on that using the lirc_sir module and lirc<br />Some external buttons for the led illumination and the mute<br />built in bluetooth<br />fm tuner<br /><br />everything else seems to be working great.<br /><br />I have found the fm tuner and the IR is seen in syslog but I can not get anything on lirc<br />Oh well not to bad for brand new hardware.<br /><br />If you guys have any ideas pass them on once I get the bugs worked out it is going All Linux :)<br /><br /></div>
