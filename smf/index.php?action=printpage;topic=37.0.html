					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am presently using a modified Frazierwall 3.5. I have every thing but one port open which is the lastest version of ssh. that forwards to my play around machine. I was wondering what everybody else is using?<br />I know that we played around with firestarter for Michael Virion which I have been meaning to get back with....Sorry Michael. Linux is really nice for firewall applications. I use an old 486 with 16meg ram and no harddrive boot from floppy it has mini httpd server/dhcp server/firewall/dns all in one and if the power ever goes it just boot's right up no problems. and has a nice web interface to manage it.<br />Brett</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm currently using IPCop (http://www.ipcop.org/cgi-bin/twiki/view/IPCop/WebHome) at home and two of our three firewalls at work are using it. The third firewall is a Cisco Pix Firewall.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hmmm...I just installed RedHat 7.2 on a box, turned off almost everything on the box, installed passthrough code (you connect to port XXX on the firewall, you get tunnled through to somewhere else inside the firewall), and tweaked /etc/sysconfig/ipchains. &nbsp;Oh, and I turned on transparent proxy for Squid and added:<br /><br />-A input -s 0/0 -d 192.168.201.0/24 80 -p tcp -j ACCEPT<br />-A input -j REDIRECT 3128 -p tcp -s 0/0 -d 0.0.0.0/0 80<br /><br />to the ipchains file. (Our local network is 192.168.201.XXX)<br /><br />What this does is to accept any connections coming from the local network on port 80 that is directed to the firewall box (actually, it's a little broader, but for the purposes of this post it'll do). &nbsp;If the connection is meant for anyone else, it redirects the connection to port 3128, which just happens to be where Squid is running.<br /><br />This allows me to selectively block outbound connections to things like doubleclick.net, which helps with popup ads ;) &nbsp;It also allows me to do this without having to mess with anyone's browser or other software taht connects out on port 80.<br /><br />I'm working on an Escapade-based front-end to the ipchains and squid stuff, so that I can selectively block inbound or outbound connections, or add hosts to Squid to refuse connections to.</div>
