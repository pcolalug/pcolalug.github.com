					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm sure we have some Slashdot (http://slashdot.org/) reads, so some of you might recognize this topic (http://slashdot.org/articles/03/01/13/0111216.shtml?tid=163) and this follow-up (http://slashdot.org/articles/03/01/13/1846205.shtml?tid=99) in regards to this (http://www.sys-con.com/linux/articlenews.cfm?id=381) story at Linux Business Week (http://www.sys-con.com/linux/index.cfm). I thought it would be interesting to see what everyone here thought of this potential move by SCO. I personally have to wonder what patent they have that would justify this action. I also have to wonder why they didn't &nbsp;take any actions several years ago before Linux got so big (not so much at stake then, yeah yeah yeah). I see some definite bad karma coming from this should they take some action which could be put against SCO Linux as well as UnitedLinux as a whole...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Don't give in to the /. histeria. SCO hasn't done anything. Sure they hold pattents. So does everyone other company in America (so it seems, sometimes). Any move to encumber Linux distributions would effectively kill United Linux dead.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I guess I'm not a good instigator of unrest, eh? Well, I guess it brought about the knee jerk flaming reaction that it was meant to. I don't like to watch Fox news for it's sensationalism and such, so I am slightly disappointed in myself, but it sure is fun to be angry at the former-Caldera/now-SCO folks and UnitedLinux. They are so easy to dislike. Maybe that is why other people watch Fox news and the other sensationalistic news companies, since they play into their viewers fears and angers. Blast spin...blast it straight to heck!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: steve</div><div class="quote">Until it makes CNN or news.com, I'll choose to sit by and watch.</div><br /><br />OK. It &nbsp;made News.com (http://news.com.com/2100-1001-980514.html?tag=fd_top).<br /><br />Here's the way I understand it. SCO wrote some libraries that allow their applications to run on other flavors of Unix as well as Linux. The libraries are currently used by many companies in order to get around buying SCO Unix and still be able to run SCO software. SCO is thinking about charging royalties for these companies using their libraries.<br /><br />I agree. SCO does deserve to be compensated for the code being used that they wrote. The article doesn't mention anything about the libraries being GPL so I'm assuming they aren't.<br /><br />It doesn't affect most of us just big companies like McDonalds.<br /><br />Steve</div>
