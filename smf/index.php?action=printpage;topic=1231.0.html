					Post by: <b>dpeach</b> on <b>December 26, 2003, 10:16:24 am</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I find myself in the unfortunate situation of needing to buy a new video card (actually this is a very good thing, I just want you to feel sorry for me).<br /><br />I am in the process of building a new computer. My current video card (Voodoo 3) will not physically fit into the AGP slot of the new board. It is a Shuttle board with a little hookie thingy on the video card (8X).<br /><br />So, a couple of questions. <br />ATI or nVidia?<br />ATI Radeon 9000 can be found fairly cheap. Why would I pay $100 more for a 9600?<br />nVidia cards that are not actually made by nVidia (http://www.internetishop.com/product_detail.asp?main_cat_no=HW&amp;sub_cat_no=15&amp;item=VG-NV-8XFX5200), are they any good? Do they use actual nVidia drivers, or will I have to depend on the company to supply the drivers?<br />Any particular card you would recommend? I would like to spend $100 or less.<br />Are there any cards I should avoid like the plague (like my sister's bedroom).<br /><br />Thanks for your help. I know these kind of discussions are time sensitive, so the information we gather here may not be helpful to too many people in the future.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've had fairly good luck with both manufacturers. From my experience, the nvidia chipsets are typically more stable than the ATIs and more game manufacturers gear their games toward nvidia chipsets.<br /><br />When nvidia makes a chipset, they release a sample card and to make a card based off of that chipset, they must meet strict specifications. No board is seriously worse than another in any way other than quality of manufacturing. Some research on Tom's Hardware (http://www.tomshardware.com) should give you a good idea of what's available and the overall quality/performance advantage per chipset.<br /><br />nvidia releases their standard driver and all nvidia cards since the Riva TNT use those unified Detonator drivers, and they are made available for Win32, Linux and FreeBSD.<br /><br />Performance wise, from what I understand, it is pretty close depending on who you talk to. I have a friend who has a Radeon 9800 and loves it, except he gets some strange artifacts in StarWars Galaxies. Other than that it works great. The GeForce FX series is good, but I have heard of problems with the high end versions. If you hold out for a few weeks, you will probably see card prices drop as the spring rolls around and the next generation of cards is readied for release.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">actully the geforce4 Ti4200 128mb whoops up majorly on the fx5200 and the fx5200ultra sometimes comes close against the ti4200 but rarely wins.... I would stay away from the fx5200....the fx5200ultra if you can find one for less than $100-120, then its a good buy usually<br /><br />a brand manufacturer that I recommend and use for 2 cards including my current card for my gaming machine(geforce4 Ti4600) is Gainward....look around for their golden sample cards, they are hard to beat.....for around $180-200 you can usually find fx5700(replaced the 5600 for most part)-5900(non-ultra) cards with 128mb mem....or if you can find a cheap geforce4 Ti4600 card, they are also hard to beat and whoop up on a good bit of the fx line of cards &nbsp;:wink:</div>

Actually, my comment was a little misleading. The card does not have the hookie thingy, the slot is expecting it. Which means that the slot as a whole has a separater bar in the wrong place.<br /><br />For example:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"><br />my card.<br /><br />___________________________<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />____ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;__|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; |_____|_____________| &nbsp;<br /><br />the slot.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;|_____________|______| &nbsp;<br /><br /></div><br />Or something like that. This was my first attempt at ASCII art. And I do not have either the card or the slot with me.<br /><br />So even if I did not have the hookie thingy to deal with, the slot is altogether different. I don't know what version of AGP the card is, but the motherboard is 8X.<br /><br />Thanks for the recommendations. I am definately leaning toward nVidia.<br /><br />(whew, ASCII art is difficult when you are not working with a fixed width font.)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">looks like the card and the slot on motherboard are rated at different voltages..... &nbsp;the card is made for the old agp voltage it looks like and the slot is made for the newer cards that run a diff voltage<br /><br />most new agp4x-8x cards have 2 cuts in them not counting the agp locking tab on the end....<br />http://images10.newegg.com/productimage/14-128-166-04.JPG</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Lloyd, I am looking around and seeing the ti4200 cheaper than the fx5200 (128 MB). Does that sound right? I would love to have a 4200 if it is the better card, and certainly if it is cheaper. <br /><br />Also, the Ti 4200s are 4X as opposed to the 8X of the 5200. That tells me that the 5200 is a newer card, but you are saying the 4200 is better. I certainly understand how that works. But since I have 8X available on my motherboad, should I try and get an 8X card?<br /><br />Any thoughts on this?<br /><br />(FYI, I am looking at that great hardware retailer, eBay. I am finding the Ti 4200 for $60-80 final selling price. There are currently only 8 items for sale. The MX 5200 are selling for $60-100 range, with most being $70-90. So we are only talking about $10 more on average There are currently 75 of the 5200s selling.)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">David,<br /><br />I'd get the 4200 Ti over the FX5200. &nbsp;The 4x/8x issue is not a big deal, and isn't even worth considering.<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok, so, currently that is the card that I am going for. Anyone else want to chime in over the next few days/hours if you have a better recommendation. The 4200 with 128 RAM and whatever other features I can get for $60-80 is what I am going for.<br /><br />Anyone local have one that you want to sell me for that price?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">there is a agp8x version of the Ti4200 128mb cards if you can find them, I would go for that if you can...or a fx5200ultra 128mb isnt too bad of a card if can find it for cheap<br /><br />but yea the fx chips are newer than the gf4 Ti chips, but I personally prefer a matured video card lol lot less issues with support &nbsp;:lol: my Ti4600 works like a charm tho so I'm satisfied &nbsp;:D also, look for gainward golden sample video cards, they are nice compared to any of the other manufacturers building on nvidia chips....they hard to miss, big red pcb vid cards with a red/chrome heatsink and they use like japanese clown looking things for logos on the gpu heatsinks sometimes<br /><br />vn cards 8)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I ended up with a Ti 4200 128MB RAM. I looked for a Gainward, but the only one I could find (on eBay) was a 64MB.<br /><br />I did some reading on benchmarks. First, I must say that some people get way too pickey. <br /><br />The 64 MB actually outperforms the 128 on about 80% of the tests I read. The 64 has a faster clock speed. The difference was very small, but the 64 was faster most of the time. But where the 128 really waxed the 64 was in the Comanche 4 (http://www.tech-report.com/reviews/2002q2/geforce4-ti4200/index.x?pg=6) game. The explanation was that the extra RAM helps with the pixel and vertex shaders. I am sure that means something to someone. The page did say that having that extra RAM will help with future games, though it was not that big of a deal right now. It also helps at higher resolutions.<br /><br />There was basically no price difference for the extra RAM, so that I what I ended up with.<br /><br />The 4200 has reports of being able to be overclocked to perform just like a 4600. The benchmarks were (http://www.tech-report.com/reviews/2002q2/geforce4-ti4200/index.x?pg=9) amazing. I don't do overclocking, but I will keep this bit of information in the back of my head if I decide the card is not performing well a couple of years from now.<br /><br />Thanks for your input.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">its true you can overclock the Ti4200 to Ti4600 stock speeds but generally you will start getting artifacts and errors in the video unless the cooling is upgraded...and in doing so, the entire overclocking process is about useless....but the gainward golden sample Ti4600 that i have can be pushed up pretty high which i do in some cases but not often lol it'll run about 352mhz core / 785mhz memory without any artifacts or errors...but for most general things, those speeds arent needed since at the stock gainward golden sample speeds(think its 325mhz/700mhz) the chip will beat up on most of the fx line of cards except the high end of the fx line lol<br /><br />i've read about people with watercooled Ti4200 chips push theirs above Ti4600 benchmarks but always seemed to have the drawback of issues with quality with flickering pixels and such caused by errors....i guess what it comes down to is what you need it for and how much stability your used to in your card<br /><br />also about the 128mb v. 64mb Ti4200 cards, the performance between them equal out in most cases now because it's a toss up between more memory or more clock speed....but in that war i would personally stick to more memory... in games that store alot of textures and such in vid memory, keeps them from pulling from the agp arpeture as much and keeps atleast a good chunk of the storage local to the card</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I wouldn't really consider overclocking. Coming from what card I had before, anything will be such a great improvment. Overclocking is a novelty to me. I just think it is interesting that it can be done.<br /><br />As far as the extra memory, I always figure more is better. If not today, then it will be in a year or two. I remember when 2 MB of RAM on your whole system was normal. 4 was high and anything more than 8 was a waste. And my very expensive video card back then had 256K.</div>
