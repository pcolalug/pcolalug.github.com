					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Has anyone noticed that with the new Firefox 1.0 PR, that the preferences have moved? They used to be under Tools. Now they are under Edit. This is only in Linux. The Windows version still has it under Tools. <br /><br />Personally, I have always felt it should have been under Edit this whole time, but I kinda got used to it under Tools. Why would they put it in 2 different places on different platforms? There was a reason they moved it I am sure. If that reason was that it is better, then shouldn't it be better for both platforms? And would't it be easier for me to explain to my parents where a setting was if their Win version was the same as my Linux version?<br /><br />And, why did they change the name of the afore mentioned preferences from Options to Preferences?<br /><br />(I am coming from 0.8, so some of these changes might have been in 0.9)<br /><br />And has anyone noticed that there is no way to search the extensions pages (https://update.mozilla.org/extensions/)? Or am I just blind and cannot find the &quot;Seach&quot; link?</div>
