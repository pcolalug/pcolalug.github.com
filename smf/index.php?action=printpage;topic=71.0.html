					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don't know if any of you use Mediacom for your isp, but word has it that they have put every node behind proxies and that their dhcp is giving everyone 10-dots. &nbsp;No ping outside your node. &nbsp;No ssh, nothing. &nbsp;I couldn't even traceroute past the dhcp server(?) The only name that nslookup seems to know is (again) the dhcp server (r21dhcp02.r21.mchsi.com, if you are interested). My service went out yesterday afternoon and I am having a hell of a time getting in touch with tech-support.<br /><br />&nbsp;:roll: I just know as soon as I am asked &quot;what operating system are you running?&quot; I'm sunk. They are also blocking service to anyone running a router/home lan until they pay US$5 per extra pc a month. &nbsp;This is ultimate suckage.<br /><br />Now their support page is flooded. &nbsp;Great. &nbsp;Anyone know of a Linux-friendly DSL provider that charges only for the service? &nbsp;I'll cut out on MC as soon as I can find one. &nbsp;I'm on through my work machine now, so reply before 5:00pm! ;)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Lesson learned. &nbsp;Do not post in anger. &nbsp;Turns out it was an isolated problem to us out here in my part of Milton. &nbsp;Rumors flew from house to house. &nbsp;There was crying and gnashing of teeth. &nbsp;I was ready to be persecuted. &nbsp;Maybe next time. &nbsp;Thanks for the heads up, though.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I know your problem is fixed, but I thought I would put a plug in for DirectTV DSL (http://www.directvdsl.com). We signed up with them when they were Telocity.com. We have had good service. I run a Linux based router that my connection comes into. Though they were not able to specifically answer any of my Linux questions, they were willing to talk with me about it. They gave me all the information I asked for and I was able to figure it out from there.<br /><br />I have not really dealt with DirectTV DSL (http://www.directvdsl.com). I have not needed to. Mom had a problem with her mail a couple of weeks ago and gave them a call. Though the problem ended up not being their problem (Norton Antivirus was making the fuss) they were able to get her going within 20 minutes. That includes the hold time.<br /><br />David<br />dpeach.com (http://www.dpeach.com) being served through my DirectTV DSL (http://www.directvdsl.com) connection.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I live in Gulf Breeze, and had Mediacom cable ISP for about two years. &nbsp;I had tons of problems with it, especially service going off for hours at a time (and being on hold for over an hour with tech support was not uncommon). &nbsp;<br /><br />Most of the time they'd come out and couldn't figure out what was wrong and resort to &quot;Looks like the modem is bad, I'll have to bring a replacement back out tomorrow&quot;. &nbsp;I went through 5 modems including the old surfboards and the newer RCA.<br /><br />Anyway, I finally got fed up and switched to BellSouth FastAccess DSL about 6 months ago. &nbsp;No problems, no downtime. &nbsp;(Actually I was down for about 2 hours a few months ago, but no problem - they provide you with a backup dial-up account for use in those situations. &nbsp;My router is setup so that as soon as my DSL goes offline my modem dials up the backup, I don't notice a loss of service -- except for the slowdown). &nbsp;<br /><br />No blocked ports so I can host websites if I like (all the pictures I link to are sitting on my router). &nbsp;<br /><br />And it turns out to be about the same price. &nbsp;One surprise was they gave me a USB modem. &nbsp;My router is an old pentium 166 NEC machine, so I had to go buy a $15 USB card for it, worked perfectly in Linux though.<br /><br />Definitely check them out. &nbsp;With my UPS backups and DSL I didn't even loose internet service through the hurricane(s). &nbsp;It was pretty nice.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Does Bellsouth put a cap on or charge you more for multiple boxen behind your router? &nbsp;Oooo, and tell us about the failover. &nbsp;Is that something you scripted or is it a feature?</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">No cap to my knowledge, with friends over I've had 9 systems online without problems.<br /><br />The failover is something I setup. &nbsp;But they provide you with a dialup account to use with something like 20 hours per month, so whenever your dsl goes down you have that to use. &nbsp;Or if you're away from home on a laptop or something you can use it to get online.<br /><br />I'll be upgrading / moving computers around next week, and reloading my router with RedHat instead of slackware. &nbsp;Once I get it all set back up and working I'll try to write-up a HOW-TO for setting up a failover connection (though I'm no router expert by any stretch of the imagination). &nbsp;Assuming everything goes as planned, watch for it in the &quot;Articles&quot; section of this board in a few weeks. &nbsp;<br /><br />Also, at least for me, I'm getting faster than I did on cable. &nbsp;Running the cnet bandwidth speed test http://webservices.cnet.com/bandwidth I would get around 600Kbps with cable, and I get around 1200Kbps with DSL.<br /><br />If you visit http://www.fastaccess.com/consumer/blsc_home.jsp you can enter your phone number and it will tell you if DSL service is available in your area yet.<br /><br />Another note: If anyone around here is also a UWF student, you have an unlimited free dialup account through the school you can make use of if you need to. &nbsp;Just call the computing center help desk and they'll give you all the info.<br /><br />Nick</div>
