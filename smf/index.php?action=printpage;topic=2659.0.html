					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Not sure if this site is better (http://the-winning-bid.com/) than the eBay search is, but it is definately a step in the right direction.<br /><br />Do a search and you get the results with photos. You can specify your price range. Which helps if you want to look for the price of say a car but don&#039;t want to get all of the results for the parts of the car. You can say that the item must be at least $100 before it shows.<br /><br />Simple interface. Less confusing than eBay itself. Has some promise, but unless they really get on the ball and make some changes, then advertise themselves, they probably won&#039;t make it. I got this off of www.digg.com which is good advertisement for them, but I think they will need to show some improvement quickly to get anywhere. Currently they are being /.ed. Not sure if digg is causing this or if they have been picked up by /. too.</div>
