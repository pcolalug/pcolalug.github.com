					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">A while back, say over a year ago Bhoff did a very good presentation on third party firmware for routers.&nbsp; He went over several different vendors that were available.&nbsp; I chose DD-WRT.&nbsp; At that time, I had been meaning to get a new router to upgrade from my old Linksys wireless &quot;B&quot; that I had for quite awhile at that point.&nbsp; I wanted to pump up the bandwidth a little and tighten up security considering my old linksis only had WEP.<br /><br />With the different options on firmware I chose DD-WRT.&nbsp; After looking to see what hardware DD-WRT supported, I went out and bought a Buffalo WHR-HP-G54.&nbsp; It was inexpensive, like $70 bucks and It has an built in AMP to increase range.&nbsp; Keep in mind this was probably a year or more ago.<br /><br />The buffalo devices have a little different installation method if you are flashing them for the first time so I used DD-WRT&#039;s wiki to guide me thru the installation.&nbsp; &nbsp;At that time version 23-v2 was the latest.&nbsp; The installation was flawless.&nbsp; I was amazed at all the options that were available to me.&nbsp; The stock buffalo firmware didn&#039;t even come close to having the options DD-WRT had.&nbsp; It was very easy to setup and secure.<br /><br />The other day I noticed DD-WRT had released the latest version V24 final.&nbsp; The upgrade was so easy.&nbsp; Since I had already flashed from the stock buffalo firmware, all I had to do was download the version specific DD-WRT for my device and log into my router select upgrade firmware, select the firmware I downloaded an BAMM...&nbsp; Anyway, I recommend checking it out if you are thinking about flashing your router to a third party firmware. You can turn your $60 router into a much more secure and expensive one with many more options available to you.<br /><br />Anyway check http://dd-wrt.com/dd-wrtv3/index.php (http://dd-wrt.com/dd-wrtv3/index.php) out.&nbsp; You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Lee <br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That is great Lee!<br />Also keep in mind that when you have any embedded hardware in your network you should always keep the firmware up to date.<br />This is becoming more and more of a security issue for not only home Networks but businesses as well.<br /><br />Note I prefer Openwrt and they too have just released a new version of kamikaze!<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">sorry to dig this back up but I recently upgraded the firmware on my WRT54G router to the DD-WRT after seeing the OpenWRT was going to be a bit picky on my model/version.<br />It has made a world of difference on my home network of 5-6 computers.<br /><br />I can vouch for the better LAN and WAN performance with the new DD-WRT firmware.... typing from my laptop on wireless now and it is running at the full 54Mbps LAN speed, downloads tend to run 500-1000kbps. Even on my main desktop I see some downloads up to 1.3Mbps.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Also, for those who installed DD-WRT V24 when it was originally released.&nbsp; V24 SP1 is out now.&nbsp; Actually has been out for some time now.&nbsp; I just didn&#039;t realize it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Lee</div>
