					Title: <b>Geek Squad...</b><br />

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Not sure if ya'll have seen Geek Squads ads out there yet, but for those looking for an onsite or in-house tech, IT support gig, this may be for you:<br /><br />http://careers.bestbuy.com/Geek.asp<br /><br />Geek Squads main website:<br /><br />http://www.geeksquad.com/main.asp<br /><br />Peace.<br /><br />Some Geek Squad background info:<br /><br />Elissa Eubanks/Staff <br /><br />Chris Blagg, who is part of the &quot;Geek Squad&quot; at Best Buy on Atlanta Highway, makes a house call to fix home computers. The &quot;Geek Squad&quot; is a 24-hour computer support task force offering in-store and in-home support. &nbsp;<br /><br />Geek Squad to the rescue, Chris Blagg makes getting stuck between a geek and a hard drive a rewarding experience <br /><br />By Wayne Ford<br /><br />When Chris Blagg gets up every morning, he doesn't have to worry about deciding which garments to don.<br /><br />After all, a guy who dresses like a geek doesn't need a vast array of choices.<br /><br />He puts on black pants, white socks, black shoes, a white, button-down shirt, black belt and a clip-on black tie.<br /><br />While driving to work, he notices people looking his way.<br /><br />&quot;It took me a while to get used to people staring at me,&quot; the Athens resident said. But the people in other cars aren't exactly looking at him. It's his car.<br /><br />Blagg drives a new Volkswagen painted black and white, like an old police car, and on the outside it states, &quot;Geek Squad.&quot; It's meant to get attention and it does.<br /><br />Since early July, Blagg has been the one-man Geek Squad member working out of the Best Buy store on Atlanta Highway, where it's his job to attend to computer problems and emergencies at homes and offices from whomever calls for the service.<br /><br />&quot;I'm the only double agent,&quot; he said proudly. &quot;The in-store guys are called CIAs - Counter Intelligence Agents. And if you catch the pun, they work behind the counter.&quot; He laughs.<br /><br />And then there are special agents.<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Special agents are not based out of a store. They are on their own, and we don't have anybody like that in this area,&quot; he said.<br /><br />Blagg, who has worked at Best Buy for a little more than three years, said the job appealed to him when he heard the local Best Buy planned to incorporate it into their offerings to customers. In this position, the Geek Squad travels to the home or office to solve and fix a computer problem.<br /><br />&quot;Doing on-site work was appealing to me for a number of reasons,&quot; he said. &quot;Probably the biggest is the car I get to drive.&quot; He laughs, but he is partially serious because he likes the car, often called the &quot;geekmobile.&quot;<br /><br />Another is closer contact with the customer, who often has a &quot;pretty big headache&quot; of a computer problem.<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;The thing that appealed to me about on-site work is being one on one with people and really having time to focus and concentrate on one person and their issues. In the store, it was often hectic with juggling customers, computers and doing a number of things at a time,&quot; he said.<br /><br />Blagg said the Geek Squad originated about 10 years ago in Minneapolis, Minn., by Robert Stephens, who started fixing computers while he was in college. Best Buy purchased the company and now uses it as a technical repair division of the company.<br /><br />Recently, Blagg had to travel to Susan Costa's home in Athens, where she was having problems with her home-office computers.<br /><br />&quot;He's been awesome,&quot; said Costa, who said she had a nightmare of a computer problem. &quot;He upgraded the memory on my computer and he had to fix a lot of stuff.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Our computers are networked, so you can't very well take the computers in (for repairs),&quot; she said.<br /><br />And what did she think of the nattily dressed fellow who showed up in the little Volkswagen?<br /><br />&quot;I don't care what they are dressed like. I just want to be able to work my computers,&quot; she said.<br /><br />Blagg, the company's own computer geek, said he became interested in computers a few years ago when he was considering a career change.<br /><br />&quot;I took background classes at Athens Tech and everything else has been on the job,&quot; he said. He grew up on St. Simon's Island and graduated from Glynn Academy High in Brunswick in 1988. He has lived in Athens for about six years following his marriage to Stacey Saye of Athens.<br /><br />While many people use computers, not many can repair them.<br /><br />&quot;One of my favorite analogies is you don't have to be able to build an engine to drive a car. Computers change so quickly and there are so many variables in trouble shooting them. Unless you're a professional or a hobbyist, it's tough to keep up with what is going on,&quot; he said.<br /><br />Blagg said the company charges a flat rate that averages $159.<br /><br />&quot;We don't charge by time, but by the job, so you're paying for knowledge, not time,&quot; he said.<br /><br />&quot;A lot of times we fix a problem people could possibly fix themselves, but they don't have the time, so the time issue is a big factor as well,&quot; he said. &quot;The convenience is a huge issue, furthermore, some things cannot be picked up and moved into the store and that is something that would have to be done onsite.&quot;<br /><br />The Geek Squad does this by sending out an expert dressed in uniform with a clip-on tie.<br /><br />But clip-ons do have purpose.<br /><br />&quot;Number one, if you get it stuck in a printer or something like that, it won't choke you,&quot; he said. &quot;Number two, if we can't make the customer happy, they can't choke us by it.&quot;<br /><br />Blagg laughs.<br /><br />And does his wife ever call him a geek?<br /><br />&quot;She does,&quot; he said, &quot;but it's a term of endearment.&quot;<br /><br />Geeks have a good sense of humor, too.</div>
