					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just wanted to let everyone know that I thought we had a very good meeting tonight. I believe that Oscar's is going to work out. The food was good and Ed's presentation was very informative. <br /><br />I am looking forward to many more presentations in the future. <br /><br />Just a couple of notes:<br /><br />1. For future meetings Oscar's would apreciate if people ordered some type of food. After all, they are lending us the space for free. I explained that a few people did not realize there would be food available. They have a very good seafood buffet and if that's not to your liking they have a menu we can order from. Anyway, I figure it's the least we can do for them letting us use a significant portion of their dining room.<br /><br />2. As has been mentioned before, we should probably get a list together of topics people want presented. Ed's topic tonight was a very good one and I'm sure Randal's will be just as good next month. I'd like to see a presentation on the &quot;Linux Directory Structure&quot;. If no one volunters for this, then I'll do the research and give the presentation. Anyway, how about some more ideas? What do you all want to know about?<br /><br />That's about it. Thanks all for coming to the meeting. We seem to be growing faster each month.<br /><br />Oh, has anyone seen our User's Group President?<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Excellent meeting, presentation and location.<br /><br />We did not have much business to discuss (you can see the secretary's report when he gets it posted). But we did go over a couple of things. <br /><br />Great discussions within the group. The thing I hate about some of it though, I cannot be in on all conversations at once. :cry: &nbsp;I wish I was able to learn from all of you.<br /><br />The meeting location was great. I will just have to remember not to eat before going next time.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Rest assured, I'm still very much alive....<br />Unfortunately, I wasn't able to make the exec or regular meetings this month -- I've been putting in very long 60 - 70 hour weeks, so have just not had time to get to them.<br /><br />I anticipate getting back to a more regular schedule within the next week or so, so I should be able to make the next exec / regular meetings...(didn't happen, unfortunately).</div>
