					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">My dealings with TFT.<br /><br />I walked in on a tech and ,i think it was Pam, argueing over a computer, the Tech said that a good cleaning and the machine would be fine, but Pam wanted to sell this old man a new 2.4 PIV so he could keep in contact with his family in Germany. &nbsp;<br /><br />The worst part about it? When the man just asked for his computer back Pam told him that he couldn't have it until they had finsihed with it. &nbsp;At which point i walked in and just asked them why don't they just charge the guy for a cleaning and get him out of the store because it was hurting business. &nbsp;Pam was less than impressed and then wanted to argue with me ,a walk in off the streets. &nbsp;<br /><br />Did i over step my bounds by asking them to just fix the issue and drop it?<br />Yes. I'll admit i did, but i wasn't yelling and screaming in a business over a simple computer sale.<br /><br />Less than impressed with the Customer Services there... <br /><br />Now, this was also six years ago... but I've never returned since.</div>
