					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just to throw a little background on this, I didn't have much time to help him with this at the time. What had happened, was he turned the computer off without doing a proper shutdown and when he turned it back on, it started doing this.<br /><br />Marshall, I'm thinking a reinstall would be your best bet if the fsck didn't work. You also might want to try out Mandrake. It does a good job of making things a little easier. Also, a lot of people here use it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">For that older box, why not try Slackware? &nbsp;If you can live without GUIs (or maybe only using something like Fluxbox) then it's done fine by me. &nbsp;Mandrake should also run fine but I don't know if it comes with the smaller GUIs (I imagine it would, though).</div>
