Chief Operating Officer Jonathan Schwartz pledged to open-source the company's Solaris operating system (see story), The SCO Group Inc. has stated that license restrictions prevent Sun from contributing its work to the General Public License.<br /><br />Solaris is based on Unix System V, the source code that has since been acquired by The SCO Group.<br /><br />The SCO Group’s marketing manager, Marc Modersitzki, said that while the company can't discuss specific details of its licensing agreements, it is confident that Sun will comply with its Unix System V license as it defines plans for open-sourcing any part of Solaris.<br /><br />“While the details of Sun's plan to open-source Solaris are not clear at this time, Sun has broader rights than any other Unix licensee,” Modersitzki said. “However, they still have license restrictions that would prevent them from contributing our licensed works wholesale to the GPL.”<br /><br />By spending more than $100 million in Unix license fees, Sun has the broadest rights of any of SCO's Unix licensees, Modersitzki said, and has been a licensee in good standing for many years.<br /><br />Although Sun has not publicly stated under which license it intends to release an open-source Solaris, Schwartz said, “Make no mistake -- we will open-source Solaris.”<br /><br />In an interview with IDG News Service last month, Schwartz said, &quot;Maybe we'll GPL it,&quot; and, &quot;We're still looking at that.&quot;<br /><br />Australian Unix User Group president and FreeBSD developer Greg Lehey said he can think of no evidence that would invalidate SCO’s statement.<br /><br />“Unless Sun has an exclusive license for the Unix code, which it obviously doesn't, it would find it difficult to change that license,” Lehey said. “I suppose the interesting question is, if Sun releases those parts of Solaris which it has developed in-house, what does that do to the code it has licensed?”<br /><br />Lehey said the GPL has the so-called viral effect, which would theoretically cause the remainder of code to fall under the GPL as well, “but that's so preposterous that I can't think of any way it could happen.&quot;<br /><br />“If there's any difference of opinion here, it would be more likely to be related to whether SCO agrees that Sun has written the code in question,” he said. “We've already seen that SCO is very hazy about the origins of the individual components of its code base.”<br /><br />Regarding SCO’s lawsuit against IBM for allegedly contributing code to Linux improperly, Modersitzki released a statement by The SCO Group requesting that the trial be delayed until September 2005 and to split the trials for IBM’s counterclaims, which include GPL violation and four patent infringements. <br /></div></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok,<br /><br />I don't like solaris at all. &nbsp;But I like sco even less. &nbsp;Kinda low of them to sick the hounds on an already dying os. &nbsp;That'd be like redhat snuffing net bsd, (despite the fact it runs on <i>everything</i> &nbsp;:wink:</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Solaris on a Sparc is freakin' sweet. I don't know what you're talking about. Fast and stable without the Mhz game. I also would hardly say that Solaris is a dying OS. Compared to HP-UX, AIX or any of the other commercial Unix brands, Solaris is going the strongest with the largest market share.</div>
