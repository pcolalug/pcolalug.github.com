					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">http://www.linspire.com/linspire_letter_archives.php?id=27<br />http://www.freespire.org/<br /><br />Linspire has announced today the free community version of their Linspire distribution. Offers optional use of the Linspire CNR (click and run) Service. The CNR Client is open source. Freespire offers proprietary drivers and software as a choice, and gives desktop Linux users the option of &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; legal support for MP3, DVD, Windows Media, QuickTime, Java, Flash, Real, ATI drivers, nVidia drivers, Adobe Acrobat Reader, third-party fonts, and so on. This is a significant first for free, community versions of Linux. Other Linux distributions do not include all of these pieces of proprietary software in their core, free distributions.<br /><br />Nick<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I keep hearing good things about Linspire. Since I&#039;m not such a huge fan of KDE and would rather not have a WinXP style interface, but the CNR service (while still $20/yr) does sound interesting. I wonder how they have managed to get that working so well. When you&#039;re apt-getting something, you have to at least answer a question here and there.<br /><br />As for the closed-source products. I think some people are beginning to forget the ideals behind the free/open-source movement. RMS and the folks at the Free Software Foundation would like for us to completely abandon all proprietary software and that software should be free as in speech. While I don&#039;t agree 100%, I sometimes wonder if commercialism isn&#039;t invading too much into the more popular realms of the free software community. I suppose the folks making money are going to listen to where that money comes from, but at what cost to the community of users?</div>
