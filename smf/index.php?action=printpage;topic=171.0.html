					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Greetings to all. &nbsp;I have been asked to attend your meetings for a couple months now. youd think i would break down and just go. &nbsp;So what happens I finally decide to go and your next meeting oct 19th is the night I have to work. &nbsp;Well I think I could just maybe make it for 30 mins. &nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway I am predominantly a windows user purely for gaming.(admin a UT server) &nbsp; I have installed at one time or another suse 7.1 7.2 mandrake 8.2 and now am running the all new mandrake 9.0. &nbsp;I am a little daunted by some of the things quirks and whatnot that linux does, hence my turning to you guys. &nbsp; (NEED INPUT) &nbsp;I am one of the the windows brainwashed. ( what, there are other ways to do this? get out!) &nbsp;<br /><br />anyway hope to score some serious gleaning from you guys<br /><br />Chuck :D</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Great to have you with the group. (Since you signed up on our forum you are officially part of us). We would love to have you at our next meeting.<br /><br />We have guys in here that are experts on just about everything. Me, I am the one that has made them the experts. I keep breaking stuff and they figure out how to fix it for me.<br /><br />Just ask your questions and I am sure you will get some answers.<br /><br />David</div>
