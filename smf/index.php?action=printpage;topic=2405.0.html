					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I was using Mandrake 10.1 for a while. It is great for a desktop machine. But I could never get PyQT to install correctly and Mandrake only offers it as an RPM for the PowerPack+, which as a broke college student I can't afford. So I finally switched back to Slackware after about 4 years using Mandrake. I had to remember how to edit config files again. The Unofficial Revised Slackware Book Project (http://slackbook.lizella.net/) helped a lot with that. Then I needed to install some new packages and Linux Packages (http://www.linuxpackages.net/) was great for that. I am pretty sure I saw both of those mentioned on the forums at some point. <br /><br />Anyways, after a few hours of work I got most everything I wanted working. My scroll mouse actually scrolls. I can mount and unmount my digital camera. PyQT is installed and working well. I just had a few quick questions. First, my fonts seem different in Slack than they did in Mandrake, not quite as nice looking. It isn't a big difference and maybe I just have a poor font chosen, but it seems like the fonts are uglier. Am I crazy? Secondly, on Mandrake when I plugged in my digital camera it automatically mounted it for me. Now I have to mount it myself. How would I get it to automatically mount? Thanks for any suggestions guys, you are always a great help. <br /><br />Todd</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">as far as auto mounting your digital camera, if you use gnome 2.8.x+ (2.10 for example), it has a system called HAL that gives you the option to automount digital cameras and removeable media, also I think for this function you might look at supermount (if it's still around), as it used to provide the automounting functions for some of the more popular user friendly distros.<br /><br />if you're a gnome fan, I'd recommend checking out freerock gnome, a clean build of gnome 2.10 for slackware. http://gsb.sourceforge.net<br /><br />for the iso:<br />http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=130126&amp;package_id=143903</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Dropline Gnome still gets my vote for slackware. &nbsp;<br /><br />http://www.dropline.net/gnome<br /><br />I assume you're using KDE? &nbsp;You may need to enable anti-aliasing on your fonts in the kde control center. &nbsp;(I think you just run kcontrol to get to it). &nbsp;<br /><br />For auto-mounting devices in slackware without Gnome, good luck. &nbsp;I hacked my way through it once but it took a while, patching and installing a new kernel + deamon tools, and configuring it all to work was a pain. &nbsp;If you go with one of the Gnome installs it should just work properly. &nbsp;(Not though, Gnome does require Kernel 2.6 which is available on the Slackware CD under /testing I think. &nbsp;If you need help installing that let us know.)<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ugh how could anyone recommend dropline?<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I found it to be really nice, but I totally loathe any software package that is as invasive as dropline. &nbsp;Uninstalling dropline left my system deader than dirt because it recursively deleted all kinds of crap which it had no busness touching.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">My objection is on principle mainly. &nbsp;<br /><br />As overlord of my machine, I only want software that 'plays nice' with the rest of the system. &nbsp;I don't <i>want</i> software that needlessly replaces core system files with it's own (I <i>trust</i> slackware's packages). &nbsp;<br /><br />Any software that cannot be cleanly uninstalled, I consider flawed. &nbsp;<br />Any software that completely breaks my system in the process, I consider <i>malware</i>.<br /><br />Dropline is very pretty, and I'm sure the developers had no malicous intent, but I won't use it.<br /><br />Right or Wrong, there's my 2 cents.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks guys. I found the anti-aliasing and the fonts look much nicer now. I prefer KDE to Gnome so for now I'll just live with no automounting. I don't have a job for the summer yet so maybe I'll fool around with it and see if I can get it working later.</div>
