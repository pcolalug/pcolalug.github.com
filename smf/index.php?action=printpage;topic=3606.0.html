					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I know this is an old post, but I wanted to provide an update. I am stationed here at Lackland, the home of the 24th AF and home of the new &quot;cyber warfare headquarters&quot;. I took a cyber defense class last year and was highly disappointed in the &quot;professional cyberdefenders&#039; &quot; inability to use UNIX or Linux when the Windows computers went down. It&#039;s true! The Windows XP machines used for cyberdefense were offline, so they went to the backup Linux computers and I would up teaching the class that I was supposed to be taking simply due to the instructor not being familiar with Linux. I did find a few Apple computers out here, but only a few people who were actually knowledgeable. <br /><br />In short, all DoD cyberdefenses appear to be in the hands of Microsoft and a few Microsoft-based applications that any monkey can operate, as long as nothing goes wrong.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sorry, I was just exaggerating in my venting. Yes, there are UNIX, Linux, and even Apple systems defending the network in the Air Force, or even at national agencies (joint service). I still would generalize network defense on the whole across all services as being defended on Microsoft Windows with special applications made by a select few vendors. I actually do not work with the Air Force with cyber missions--my cyber mission is a joint-service one from a national agency. The Air Force guys just sit upstairs. I will still assert that DoD in general could do a better job of defending the network if it would move away from its preferred vendors (Microsoft, Lockheed Martin) more often.</div>
