					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">okay first off, i'm trying to get my wireless card to work. &nbsp;me and brent have tried using madwifi, but can't get it to work. &nbsp;i used to use an online ndiswrapper, but the free trial expired and i don't want to shell out $20 for the permanent one. &nbsp;i've tried a free one that i've downloaded, and i've installed it and put the windows drivers in it, but it still won't work. &nbsp;and i followed the instructions to the letter. &nbsp;oh yeah, my card is a D-Link AirPlus Xtreme G: DWL-G650.<br /><br />second of all, transparency of the console program. &nbsp;i'm using fluxbox, and Brent is using the same thing. &nbsp;his works fine. &nbsp;his console program is transparent. &nbsp;mine is configured just like his, and we got it to work one time, but now it won't. &nbsp;this would really be helpful considering i have to do a lot of instruction reading while online when installing new programs and having to use the console at the same time.<br /><br />third, i don't know why i didn't post this as soon as i got linux. &nbsp;guess i kept forgetting. &nbsp;every time i start up fluxbox, i have to put a new wallpaper up. &nbsp;it won't save it from one session to the next.<br /><br />okay, lastly, xscreensaver. &nbsp;comes up fine, but it usually terminates after about five slides every time. &nbsp;it will run for a long time every now and then, but mostly it quits after a short time.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">we've tried madwifi, but we can't get it to work. &nbsp;i do not have the revision A card. &nbsp;Slideshow is the screensaver i use because it's the only one i like, plus i collect pictures of things like video game wallpapers and the like. &nbsp;and to answer the question of why i'm using fluxbox, it's the only one that will run fine on my computer. &nbsp;KDE was slower than Windows XP. &nbsp;it took about 5 minutes to boot up and shut down, and it took over a minute just to start firefox and most other programs. &nbsp;the transparency thing and the screensaver aren't really that big of a deal, but the wireless card i would really like to get working. &nbsp;right now we're having to run a cable from the router, through the living room, to my computer. &nbsp;we've just got wires everywhere, and it would be nice to get rid of one or two. &nbsp;the wallpaper thing is quite annoying, but not really that essential to be fixed. &nbsp;sorry to bother y'all with all this crap, again.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">never mind about the wireless card. &nbsp;i broke down and bought the $20 one from linuxant.org. &nbsp;good news is, it works. &nbsp;ever since we reinstalled linux, xscreensaver hasn't been crashing, but it did put out an error message after every picture in the slideshow, but i reinstalled xscreensaver, and now it runs perfectly. &nbsp;my wallpaper still resets itself every time i log out, so any advice about that would still be helpful. &nbsp;and we can't get transparency to work at all now. &nbsp;b4 we could use fbsetbg filename.jpg to turn it on, but now that doesn't even work. &nbsp;probably have to just bring my lappy to the next meeting, but any advice till then might be helpful.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">on the Mandriva site it says that it costs like nine dollars and something. &nbsp;but anyway, i've got just about everything working like i like it on fluxbox. &nbsp;the wallpaper thing is just a minor annoyance, nothing i can't just live with. &nbsp;i've pretty much gotten used to it now. &nbsp;i don't really feel like installing another distro.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This may be a bit silly, but find out where fb is saving your session settings and check your permissions on the files/directories there. The first time seriously ran a Linux distro, I couldn't for the life of me get Gnome to remember my theme settings. Turns out I was missing a file and some permissions.</div>
