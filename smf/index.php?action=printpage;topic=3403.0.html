					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just a bump to this thread to remind everyone that the IRC channel (#pcolalug on irc.freenode.net) is still alive and well, and sometimes people actually talk in there!&nbsp; Stop by and have a conversation about Linux, or whatever else you&#039;d like to talk about.&nbsp; It&#039;s fun!<br /><br />See you there.<br />Dan<br /><br /></div>
