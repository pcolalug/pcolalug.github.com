					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">PERL Cookbook 2nd Edition O'reilly<br />By: Tom Christiansen &amp; Nathan Torkington<br /><br />Well I have the complete PERL library. From the PERL Black book to the PERL bookshelf and all between. When I first ordered the PERL Cookbook I was looking for a god resource for quick scripts to help me in My OpenMosix development. I received the book at our April Meeting and was immediately surprised by it's heft at 927 pages it is well packed with technical information on a wide range of subjects and code snippets to get you on you way.<br />I was let down by the complex nature of the language...While well done for a PERL or Programming Guru it was not easy comprehend able by the average user that I felt would be looking to purchase this book. The code snippets are a God send thou and more than make up for the overly technical writing.<br />I personally used the network and file scripts and was able to put them to work immediately. I would not recommend this book to Novices, But all others would surely gain a valuable edge by having this in there library.<br />Brett hoff<br />Pensacola Linux User Group.<br />bhoff@pcolalug.org<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This has also been posted to Amazon Books and O'reilly</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">dunno, I've always been under the impression that we post on O'Reilly's site aswell as a site like amazon/slashdot/b&amp;n. I could swear I read it somewhere lol but can't seem to find it. I guess I always counted it under one of the 2 other sites that we're suppose to post to.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: rburt3</div><div class="quote">Just a friendly reminder that reviews should be done within a couple (2) weeks of receiving the book. Also, you need to post your review to at least two other sites, as well as this one. Amazon, B&amp;N, and Slashdot all take public reviews. I have to send the reviews back to O'Reilly, as well as where they are posted.</div></div>
