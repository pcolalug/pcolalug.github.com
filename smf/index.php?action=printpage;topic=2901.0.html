					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, it looks like irc.debian.org is moving to OFTC. Previously, it pointed to Freenode, but for some reason has moved to OFTC. I still have a bad taste in my mouth over that drama we had with the OFTC folks last year. If you were around, you&#039;ll know what I&#039;m talking about. You can dig through the forums if you don&#039;t.</div>
