					Title: <b>Linux friendly laptops</b><br />

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Based on past experience, I have found that laptops tend to be the least friendly area to Linux. <br />I recently got a newer laptop and found that Ubuntu 9.04 works perfect with no need to download or install or use any hardware.<br />I got a Compaq CQ60-211DX, it has a single core Celeron 585 @ 2.16GHz, 2GB DDR2, Intel 4500M video, 160GB hard drive, 15.6&quot; widescreen, and a full keyboard with the full numpad to the right side as well.<br /><br />So I had an excellent experience with this laptop, anyone else have others to add to the list of linux friendly laptops?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve had great results with this Dell XPS M1530.&nbsp; Core2Duo T8100 CPU&#039;s (2.10Ghz), 4GB RAM, Nvidia 8600M GT video, 200GB 7200rpm hard drive, 15.4&quot; widescreen, wired and wireless network, Intel HD audio, built in webcam and microphone, DVD R/RW burner.&nbsp; All working perfectly with Slackware 12.2.&nbsp; Also, even the hardware buttons for volume control, CD play/eject buttons, and screen brightness work. <br /><br />One thing I haven&#039;t gotten working is the &quot;5-in-1&quot; card reader slot (for camera media, etc).&nbsp; I think it&#039;s just a matter of getting a proper driver for it (&quot;sdhci&quot;), but I haven&#039;t really needed it so haven&#039;t bothered.<br /><br />I really like this laptop and recommend it.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve had some dealings with Linux Certified.&nbsp; Among other things they sell laptops pre-loaded with various Linux distros.&nbsp; Their prices do not seem competitive to me but you can check out the specifications on some of the machines they offer and do your own shopping for hardware.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.linuxcertified.com/linux_laptops.html</span><br /><br />sandspur<br />living and dying in runlevel three<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.pcola.com/sandspur/</span></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">My Gateway M-6750 is a bit over a year old. I have been very pleased with it. My card reader works as well as all the function key buttons. I have not tried any of the video/music playback specific buttons. I never watch DVDs or listen to CDs on this machine. This is with Kubuntu 9.04. Various versions of Kubuntu have worked more or less. This version has worked perfectly out of the box except the wireless driver. I had to install the ndiswrapper package to get that going.<br /><br />Things are getting much easier on the hardware support. I am sure there are still some nightmare machines out there, but this one has worked great.<br /><br />Oh, I have not tried video. (May play with that just to see). I had it working once before, but after a lot of configuration. I will drop Skype on here and see if the video works.<br /><br />&lt;long wait&gt;<br />&lt;/long wait&gt;<br /><br />Yup. Video works perfectly.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">My Dell Inspiron E1505 I got in 2006 has become more linux friendly over the years.&nbsp; Wireless used to be a major problem, now that&#039;s been solved.<br /><br />However it&#039;s aged rather poorly.&nbsp; The latest Ubuntu release lags terribly in the worst possible sense.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been using XP lately because it&#039;s FASTER.&nbsp; I need to find another distro.&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />Otherwise, after about a year, and now that Dell has sort of adopted Ubuntu, their hardware has become quite linux friendly.&nbsp; Media buttons work great.&nbsp; Not sure about the memory card reader, as I have no SD cards.</div>
