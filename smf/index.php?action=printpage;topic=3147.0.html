					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well the title is a little misleading. I have been listening to podcast for months now and kept hearing about this issue so I thought <br />I would research it a little.<br />First when ever you connect to a network with windows it adds the AP SSID to it&#039;s preferred network list.<br />Well this sounds good, But when ever your radio is on (wireless turned on) you are actually brodcasting your preferred networks list<br />out into the open looking for them. This is happening all the time. Also another issue with Microsoft is that if there is a stronger network <br />your wireless will jump ship and connect to this other AP...even ad-hoc....Now because the other microsoft wireless connected ad-hoc you have been added to his Preferred network list like a virus. This keeps perputating!<br />Wireless basics most office and home wireless cards transmit about 1mw, Most commercial AP&#039;s about 50mw. Cards like the SENAO is a 200mw.<br />So you are asking? So what my card is blasting out these preferred networks list how can that hurt me.<br />Well simple you grab a tool like KARMA boot up your handy laptop at the nearest krystals and it will see there SSID request and automatically change yours to match there requested SSID ..........example they are blasting out toor-home KARMA will change your ssid to be toor-home and make you&nbsp; a ad-hoc AP also it can route there internet request out so the person never knows! So there you are captured there password for there preferred network and they are connected to your laptop.....Where you do have all your hack tools loaded ready to go.( you do have all your hack tools loaded right?). It is a simple matter to crack a windows box when you are conencted right to it. Microsoft does acknoledge this but has never patched it. So always turn off those wifi cards when not in use.<br /><br />By the way have you ever noticed that you can be in the middle of a field with the nearest wireless AP barely there not enough to connect to.<br />But let there be microsoft updates they always have a way to get to your computer. I have had this happen on several occasions and wonder it this is maybe a microsoft trick..................<br /><br />And the SENAO Wireless 802.11b PCMCIA Card NL-2511CD PLUS EXT2 200mw has taken the lead as the wireless card of choice over the Onico gold!<br /><br />The grammer police may decode this as they please!</div>
