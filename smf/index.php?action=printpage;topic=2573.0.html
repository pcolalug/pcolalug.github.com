					Title: <b>New Printer</b><br />

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi all,<br /><br />Just got a new printer yesterday, and I'm so happy with it that I wanted to pass on a quick review of it. &nbsp;I picked up a Brother HL-5140 Laser printer. &nbsp;It's a midrange type printer which holds 250 sheets of paper and prints at 21 ppm (which is pretty fast).<br /><br />I got it working perfectly with CUPS, but had to do a little more work than I have in the past. &nbsp;This printer wasn't listed in the CUPS database, so I had to get the driver and install it myself. &nbsp;For those of you who have not been there, the site: &nbsp;http://www.linuxprinting.org &nbsp;is a wonderful place to get info/drivers for printers. &nbsp;I downloaded the required &quot;.ppd&quot; file for this printer from there, and placed it in the /usr/share/cups/model directory. &nbsp;After restarting CUPS, my new printer is now listed, and I could install it normally. &nbsp;I actually have it attached to a Linksys print server on my LAN, and it works perfectly. &nbsp;The print quality is outstanding.<br /><br />It was also a breeze to set up for the couple of Windows machines that my wife and daughter use. &nbsp;If you are in the market for a decent printer (that works well in both Linux and Windows), I would definitely recommend this one.<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just recently picked-up the Brother HL-2070N (specifically because it says &quot;Linux Compatible&quot; on their website). &nbsp;<br /><br />These brother printers are fairly nice, dunno how well they will hold up over time, but definitely easy to use. &nbsp;I think this thing emulates about 8 different printers (some IBMs, a few HP LaserJets, PostScript, etc), and can appear to your system as a JetDirect print server, windows print server, IPP (CUPS) Print Server, LPD print server, etc. <br /><br />So I'd say I also have to recommend the Brother laser's to any of you guys looking for a new printer.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Cool. &nbsp;I was looking at that model too, mostly because it's got a built in Ethernet port. &nbsp;Since I already have a printserver on the LAN, I went with the other model (same price). &nbsp;Glad to see more/better Linux support by printer manufacturers.<br /><br />Dan</div>
