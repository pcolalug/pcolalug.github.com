					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: MIT</div><div class="quote">For as long as most technologists can remember, there has been &quot;Wintel,&quot; the $250 billion industry dominated by Microsoft's Windows operating systems and Intel's microprocessors. But &quot;Lintel,&quot; or the Linux operating system and Intel, is now encroaching on this empire, and behind it is the entire open-source software movement, which threatens to overthrow the Windows industry. Faced with this challenge, Microsoft is showing classic symptoms of &quot;incumbents' disease.&quot; Rather than remaking itself, Microsoft is using legal threats, short-term deals, and fear, uncertainty, and doubt to fortify its position. But this strategy probably won't work. The Linux operating system and the open-source model for software development are far from perfect, but they look increasingly likely to depose Microsoft.</div><br /><br />The complete article is available at: <br />http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/05/06/issue/feature_linux.asp<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">as there was IBM PCDOS, Digital Research DOS, there became MSDOS/WINxx.<br /><br />as there was OS/2 vs. NT vs. Novell, Microsoft triumphed over the incumbent.<br /><br />sure, there have been stumbles.. anyone here remember the gui for a gui, microsoft bob? :)<br /><br />BUT, as the OS/2 camp tried to say NT stood for &quot;Nice Try&quot;, Microsoft hammered on and crushed them.<br /><br />Microsoft used to be the little upstart software company that could, out in wahoo land of washington... they used to be the giant killer, now they are the giant? &nbsp;<br /><br />Maybe opensource will take over the desktop some day, we'll see, probably after Gates 'n the original core team retire, and the company loses its vision. Till then...</div>
