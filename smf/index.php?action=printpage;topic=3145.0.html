					Title: <b>Relocating to beautiful Pensacola!</b><br />
					Post by: <b>audilover</b> on <b>April 09, 2007, 11:43:21 am</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">After literally growing up in the summers in the area while visiting family year after year, it has always been my dream to make Pensacola my permanent home. When my husband and I were dating, I introduced him to the area by taking him on my yearly trips down there, needless to say..he fell in love with it as well. We are finally making our dream happen by seeking employment. I was offered positions last year during my &quot;interview&quot; visit but was unable to take any of the opportunities due to my husband not having any offers. Our new plan is for just my husband to find a position and I&#039;ll begin my search once we&#039;re moved.<br /><br />If anyone could give me any networking ideas/contacts, company information, etc. to help us make our dream happen, it would be very helpful! My husband has office management experience, executive assistant, web development, business development, and networking administrating. Many more skills to add. He is interested in going into any field, so any suggestions or contacts any of you may have, let me know!<br /><br />I&#039;ve been checking out the forums for the last 4 years and have finally made a profile to join the fun :)<br /><br />THANKS EVERYONE!!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve said it before and I&#039;ll say it again; anyone with some .NET experience can find a job right away.&nbsp; There are positions available working with local government contracts.&nbsp; I also know of an entry level accounting position and training sales positions available.&nbsp; The sales is base+commissions and the accounting is in the $25-30k range.&nbsp; If you&#039;re interested, just let me know and I&#039;ll put you in touch.&nbsp; Does your husband have any programming skills?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Programming is one skill he wished more than anything. As far as his skills go, here is a list that might be helpful to any resources you may have or come across that would be helpful:<br /><br />-Web development<br />-Server2003 administration<br />-Network administration<br />-SQL server<br />-Adobe Photoshop<br />-Basic .asp<br /><br />I posted before that he has also been an office manager, executive assistant, and many other interesting trades but those are the areas and skills he would like to stay with. Hope that helps a bit with any contacts you may here of or come across<br /><br />Ideally, he would like to stay around the salary range of $40-50k<br /><br />Thanks again! By the way, how&#039;s the weather been ;) We had 3ft+ of snow on Easter, horrible...</div>
