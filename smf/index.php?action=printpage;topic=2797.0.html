					Post by: <b>jaymz_720</b> on <b>February 16, 2006, 03:52:15 pm</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have a question on the size of variables and the numbers themselves. If you were trying to calculate probability and had an equation that looked like this: (1/2)^avagadros number (6.2x10^23), you&#039;d have an insanely small number, but it is possible to calculate it? I tried on windows using visual studio and it doesn&#039;t go all that high before it starts spitting out #inf. As I understand there&#039;s a maximum value that a number can be, can that number be manipulated? I&#039;m not sure that I completely understand where the limits are set for the values, are they set by the OS or the hardware? And will Linux go any higher than a MS based IDE?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />James</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Since Pi has been calculated out to millions of decimal places, there has to be a way.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing that it would involve doing a calculation, storing the result in a large char buffer, shifting some bits, more calculations, append the result to the buffer,&nbsp; repeat until done.&nbsp; Just a guess though, all of my programming experience involved business applications, not scientific.<br /><br />Good luck.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Try using a long double, and you *should* get all the precision you need for most applications.<br /><br />If however, you need an insane ammount of precision, i imagine a long double on an amd64 would suit you nicely.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I did try long double and it does get a little more accurate, but no where near the end. I&#039;m not sure that my little system can handle that kind of a number. I&#039;d estimate it to be well over 100,000 zeros at least, probably over a million.&nbsp; The last number that I got to was (blah blah blah^-999)^whatever x 10^18. It&#039;s already at nearly 1000 zeros behind the decimal and only dropped 5 off the original exponent. :(<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I don&#039;t think pi was calculated on a 32b either.</div>

Keyword is &quot;calculated&quot;, not stored in a variable. For your project, don&#039;t rely on the precision of the variables, but examine the method of how you would determine the correct answer. You&#039;ll probably find that all you need are simple integers and allocate space to store the result. As you keep iterating through the process refining the answer to higher precision, you&#039;ll more than likely either dump the result to screen, or store in a char type location. With this method, your precision is only constrained by the amount of memory you have.<br /><br />Jesse</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">i know you want a floating point number, but there is a c++ class big int that can hold an int of arbitary length, maybe you could use that and work around it being an int usingsome logic,(not impossible).</div>
