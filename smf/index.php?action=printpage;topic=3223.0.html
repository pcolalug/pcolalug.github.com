					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Question, I&#039;m looking into making my computer into a place where I can record myself playing video games.&nbsp; Like PS2 games.<br /><br />I have my capture card installed and configured and I can play it with mplayer or anything else really.<br /><br />However, I can&#039;t play it and capture it at the same time.<br /><br />Well, I&#039;ve come up with two different ways to do that actually, but each has a problem.<br /><br />I can tee /dev/video0 to two fifos and play from one and record from the other, but it only runs at 10fps because the v4l driver doesn&#039;t run the control commands for the device correctly because it&#039;s attempting to act upon the fifo and not the block device.<br /><br />Or I can mplayer then dump the video stream to a fifo, tee the fifo into another instance of mplayer and mencoder, but that&#039;s results in a 1/5 second of lag, which is undoable for playing video games.<br /><br />Does anyone know how I can send the device control signals directly to /dev/video0 so when I attempt to play the video it runs at 29.97 fps?<br /><br />Or of a different way to do it altogether?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I had the same basic issue here, trying to record video games on a pvr 250.<br /><br />There will always be some lag between what you do in game, and what happens on the tuner.&nbsp; Honestly, your best option is to split out the coax.&nbsp; One goes to the tv, and the other goes to the capture card.&nbsp; I took the raw mpeg and converted it to avi using ffmpeg, then edited it using avidemux.&nbsp; The end result can be found here:<br /><br />http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=tastygrunt<br /><br />Keep in mind the source vids were much higher quality.<br /><br />Can&#039;t wait to try the in game playback in halo 3.&nbsp; Looks like it will rock.</div>
