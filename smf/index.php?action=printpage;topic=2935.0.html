					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m having a hard time getting my new wireless adapter fully working. I got a Linksys WUSB54G ver4, which is supported by the ural driver in OpenBSD. I want to get this thing setup to run as a hostap, and it works fine as an 802.11b ap. The problem is that it should be able to work as a 802.11g ap. Here&#039;s the ifconfig I&#039;m using to configure it.<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"># ifconfig ural0 10.20.60.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 media OFDM54 mode 11g mediaopt hostap chan 10 nwid ruggy</div><br />That should make it work, but this is what I get with the ifconfig ural0 output.<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">ural0: flags=8843&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lladdr 00:0f:66:75:fa:65<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; media: IEEE802.11 OFDM54 mode 11g hostap (autoselect mode 11g hostap)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; status: active<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ieee80211: nwid ruggy chan 10 bssid 00:0f:66:75:fa:65 100dBm<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inet6 fe80::20f:66ff:fe75:fa65%ural0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0xd<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inet 10.20.60.1 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 10.20.60.255</div><br />The thing that caught my eye was the fact that on the media line, autoselect mode 11g hostap are in parenthesis. Don&#039;t ask me why. If you guys have any idea, please let me know. While I got the adapter as a hell of a deal (&lt; $20.00), I would hate to think I got it and it won&#039;t work for what I had intended it to do.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Output of dmesg<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">ural0: Cisco-Linksys Wireless-G USB Network Adapter, rev 2.00/0.04, addr 2<br />ural0: MAC/BBP RT2571 (rev 0x03), RF RT2526, address 00:0f:66:75:fa:65</div><br />The client is most definitely a g capable card. No b cards are connecting whatsoever. <br /><br />As for firmware upgrades, isn&#039;t the firmware loaded onto these cards when the drivers loads? The firmware for these USB and PCMCIA cards are not actually stored on the card as far as I know.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am studing the info provided but from What I found there is a hardware firmware on the device and you can upgrade it.<br />I did a lot of googling on this and it seems there is a few people having similar problems and this is some of the issuses mentioned.<br />Also the driver is still in the infant stages and not fully developed yet just like the atheros driver :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">No firmware updates available from Linksys (http://tinyurl.com/dz5mx)<br /><br />I did post to the forums run by the person that made the *BSD drivers for the ral2500 chipset. I guess I&#039;ll wait to hear something there. I&#039;ve also done searches, but haven&#039;t found anything that is the same problem as mine. I&#039;ve found other people using different adapters in the same configuration getting 802.11g 54mb, so I don&#039;t know what the heck the problem is. <br /><br />I&#039;m thinking about just separating my network into vlans at my WRT54G and letting my OpenBSD box route between them. My whole thing is to split the wireless off into a seperate subnet and then require it to go through my OpenBSD box encrypted. Benefit being that everything going through the air would be encrypted at a much better level than the encryption my current hardware will support, the encryption would be done on much more powerful processors and I can take the WEP encryption off of my wireless, thus speeding it up. <br /><br />Anyhow, now you know. Once I&#039;m done with whatever route I go, I&#039;ll do a write up.<br /><br /></div>
