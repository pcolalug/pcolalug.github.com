					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just got word that there are several positions open at Eglin AFB. They are looking for a candidate with a current Top Secret clearance (within scope) who has the technical know how for this kind of work. &quot;Salaries are negotiated based on the position and level of experience of the applicant.&quot; Here are the positions:<br /><br />Intermediate Oracle Database Administrator<br /><br />Experienced Linux / Microsoft System Administrator<br /><br />Experienced Video Teleconference Administrator<br /><br />53 Wing Information Systems Security Manager (53 WG ISSM)<br /><br />If you feel you meet the clearance requirement and have the appropriate experience, send me a resume and I&#039;ll pass it along.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m at Maxwell. A couple of people that I work with have contacts at Eglin and they were passing it on to me. Unfortunately, I&#039;m active duty until the beginning of next year, so I figured I would pass the info along. I don&#039;t plan to return to the NWFL area, but if you happen to know anyone in the San Antonio area, I should have a fresh TS and my resume is primed.</div>

Love that place. Used to go there quite a bit as a teen. Drove it from here, we&#039;d stop @ Beaumont to visit friends. Beaumont the &quot;city under the overpass&quot; lol!<br /><br />Well, if I was in Texas, then the first place I&#039;d hit would be Dell.. then Rackspace.<br /><br />Heck, why not start shopping yourself around now w. the major defense contractors. Your TS is gold to them. :) <br /><br />Peace!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m in San Antonio now. There seem to be plenty of TS clearance jobs out here, especially at Lackland. If you want to stay away from Intel, an occasional job on Brooks City-Base may pop up. Those jobs will likely move to Lackland soon, but they do interesting work there.</div>
