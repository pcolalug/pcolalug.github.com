					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The government is paying me a bunch of backpay and I am putting it toward a new computer. I knew I was vastly underpaid, but this is for my time in the desert. Anywho, congress is giving me your tax dollars so let me thank you for my new computer. So that I might spend your money the best, I wanted to get some suggestions from you, the taxpayer.<br /><br />Here is what I'm thinking. I have a $1100 to $1200 budget. Yes it is vague...<br /><br />Aluminum case with 350 to 400 watt ps<br />nForce2 motherboard (using onboard nic and sound)<br />Athlon processor (something like the 2500+ with decent heatsink and shim)<br />512MB PC2700 DDR (2x 256MB)<br />Geforce 4 w/ 128 MB<br />80 to 100 GB hard disk (preferably Seagate)<br />DVD-ROM, CD-RW, CD-ROM (yes all three) and floppy<br /><br />Now, I need suggestions on all of these such as specific models and places to buy. Thanks for doing my work for me. I'll be searching also in the mean time and I'll let you know what I pick on my own.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Check out the nForce2 motherboard's linux support before you buy. &nbsp;My friend just got one (an Asus) - linux support is minimal for it. &nbsp;I think he can't run his hard drives full speed, and no 3d acceleration (something about the AGP gart not having a driver, he has a Matrox G400 3D card - you might not have that problem if you're going with an nvidia card too). &nbsp;I have the Via KT400 (or 400a I don't remember) and everything is working as expected. &nbsp;No word on the onboard sound drivers he's using an external sound card. &nbsp;The NICs work though.<br /><br />And on your DVD, CDRW, CD -- I'm wishing I had spent the extra money and gotten a DVD-Recorder with my computer. &nbsp;I have maybe 300 burned CD's - I could cut that down a lot if I were using 4.7gb or whatever DVD disks. &nbsp;I was worried about compatibility - but I don't think I know anybody that doesn't have at least one DVD capable computer. <br /><br />Just my 2 cents. &nbsp;Good luck!<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: imnes</div><div class="quote">Check out the nForce2 motherboard's linux support before you buy.</div><br /><br />I have looked into it some and that is seeming to be the general concensus. I hear that apggart does work with nvidia cards and the linux drivers from nvidia are getting better. My main reason for wanting nForce2 over a VIA chipset is stability. I have heard a lot about VIA chipsets being flakey, but I will re-evaluate that. Lastly, I don't think I'm going to get a DVD-/+R/RW yet. I think that is going to be a wee bit out of my budget and I don't do a whole lot of burning anyway.<br /><br />Updated:<br /><br />http://www.antec-inc.com/pro_details_enclosure.php?ProdID=80843<br />I think I'm going to go with this case. No, it isn't aluminum, but I like it and at newegg.com it is $85.00+shipping with 350W PS. I think I will replace the fans with the antec smartfans, though. <br /><br />I think I'm going to go with the VIA now. The other major selling point of it for it is the fact that it can use single memory modules due to it being a single channel board. The KT400A is supposed to have close to even performance with the nForce2 with its dual channel design.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Don't have any experience with nforce2 or via chipsets, but have had good luck with a couple of ECS K7S5A motherboards (SIS chipset). &nbsp;The built-in SIS900 NIC (10/100) works perfectly. &nbsp;Haven't ever used the onboard sound (AC97?) in Linux, but it's crap in Windows. &nbsp;I'd rather use a decent sound card, which are real cheap nowadays.<br /><br />The rest of your rig sounds good, although I'd go with a single 512 memory stick instead of 2x256. &nbsp;I think many of the MB's now only have 2 DDR slots, and that would leave you room for future expansion... &nbsp;Also I prefer Western Digital HD's, but that's probably just a Ford vs Chevy issue these days. &nbsp;I do think you'll be very pleased with a GF4 Ti (don't get the MX), and the new Nvidia drivers are sweet. &nbsp;Good luck.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have an Antec case (the 2600). &nbsp;They seem to be very well built and sturdy. &nbsp;So far as stability on the KT400's - my computer has been rock solid. &nbsp;It's only ever crashed once since I built it (built in October last year), and that's because my power supply was faulty - only putting out 9v instead of 12v. &nbsp;After replacing that it's happy again. &nbsp;<br /><br />Good luck with whatever you buy.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here is what I have found. I put this together on newegg.com (http://www.newegg.com). They seem to be reputable and they also seem to have all around good prices. <br /><br />Antec Performance II Workstation Case w/ 350 Watt Smart Power PS (http://www.antec-inc.com/pro_details_enclosure.php?ProdID=80843) - $84.99<br />3 x Antec 80mm Case Smartfans (http://www.antec-inc.com/pro_details_cooling.php?ProdID=77040) - $45.00 ($15.00 ea)<br />Asus A7V8X (http://usa.asus.com/products/mb/socketa/a7v8x/overview.htm) with Serial ATA, RAID, 10/100 LAN, Realtek Audio - $111.99<br />AMD (http://www.amd.com) Athlon XP 2600+ 333 FSB - $150.00<br />Dynatron DC1206BM-L/610-P-CU CPU Cooler (http://www.dynatron-corp.com/products/cpucooler/cpucooler_model.asp?id=11) - $14.00<br />Thermaltake Copper Shim (http://www.thermaltake.com/products/accessories/shim1594.htm) - $5.00<br />Arcticsilver (http://www.arcticsilver.com/) Thermal Paste - $7.00<br />Crucial 512MB PC2700 DDR RAM (http://www.crucial.com/store/partspecs.asp?imodule=CT6464Z335&WSMD=CT6464Z335&WSPN=CT6464Z335) - $68.00<br />Gainward GeForce4 TI4200 8x AGP 128MB DDR DVI/TV Out (http://www.gainward.com/c-2.html) - $130.00<br />Creative Labs Audigy with Firewire - OEM (http://www.soundblaster.com/products/audigy/) - $64.00<br />WD 120GB 7200RPM ATA100 8MB Buffer (http://www.westerndigital.com/en/products/products.asp?DriveID=27) - $129.00<br />Sony 52x EIDE CD-ROM - OEM - $23.00<br />LiteOn 16x DVD-ROM XJ-HD166S- $34.00<br />MSI 52x24x52 CD-RW w/ 2MB Buffer (http://www.msicomputer.com/product/optical/optical_detail.asp?model=52x24x52_CD-RW) - $43.50<br />Teac 3.5&quot; Floppy - OEM - $9.00<br /><br />Not part of the system, but needed none-the-less:<br />Linksys BEFSX41 VPN Firewall/Router w/ 4-port 10/100 switch (http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?grid=34&scid=29&prid=433) - $61.00<br /><br />Shipping - $43.26<br />Total - $1022.74<br /><br />I don't think this is too shabby for a 2+ Ghz system. Now, suggestions are welcome and expected. If you think I can do better and stay under my $1100 (including shipping) budget, let me know. I should have some parts to throw toward the Swap Meet once this thing is built also. I don't see a need in having four working computers sitting around &nbsp;:P</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm not sure how the prices compare. &nbsp;I've ordered the last few times from a Florida company called Thompson's Computer Warehouse and I really like dealing with them. &nbsp;www.tcwo.com I think. &nbsp;You can check into it if you want. <br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay, I have come to my senses and I am no longer going to build this new system. I have better, more responsible things to do with that money, so I am going to just buy the Geforce4 and a new hard drive. I'll upgrade the rest as I can afford it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Wow.....I went to that www.tcwo.com site that Imnes suggested for parts.<br /><br />Outstanding prices (Athlon XP 2200+ $86, GeForce4 Ti 4200-8XAGP, 128MB $147, 512MB PC2700 333MHz $65, etc...).<br /><br />In fact I bought a whole bunch of new parts and am going to rebuild 2 of my machines. &nbsp;This will result in enough left overs for me to create a third machine for running Linux on (P3-600, 512MB ram, 40GB 7200 HDD), instead of dual boot sharing of my kids machine. &nbsp;Will give him my Athlon XP 1800+, 512MB, 20GB 7200 HDD, setup.....is that enough horsepower for a 4 year old??? &nbsp;Want to make sure he starts off on the right foot!!!!! &nbsp;GRIN<br /><br />Thanks for the tip on a great site Nick! &nbsp; Tap tap tap goes my foot waiting on Fedex.......<br /><br />Narsil</div>
