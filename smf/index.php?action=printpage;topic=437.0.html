Oh, I do have problems loading the site during heavy traffic time from the Navy base but then I just hit refresh or wait a few minutes and try again. I've never had problems getting to slashdot from home.<br /><br />When you have probems, before blaming it on slashdot, I would try some rudimentary troubleshooting like reboot your system, try another system and call a friend on another network and have them try it. <br /><br />I've found over the years that slashdot has one of the most stable sites around. Again, I find it very strange that it would be their problem, especially if they haven't made any posts about having problems.<br /><br />Steve</div>

It turned out that a few minutes after I posted to the forum, the problem cleared up. This was after closing and loading phoenix again as well as checking the site from the proxy, which is a command line system. I had deleted the cookies for the page and cleared my history. I experienced this &quot;weirdness&quot; for a solid 20 minutes. After posting the message, tried a few more links on /. and then a minute or so later, things cleared up. The problems seemed to be more with the rendering of the pages which is done by the backend perl scripts. I am fairly confident that there was some sort of weirdness on /.'s side. Considering this was around 2:45 am CST, I would imagine that being a very low traffic time for them (despite their world-wide presence) and would be a good time to test new things out. <br /><br />Not being defensive...just explaining that I'm not an idiot who jumps to conclusions. &nbsp;:D</div>

The troubleshooting methods I described were for everyone's benifit. Not just Newbies but also people that have been around a while and, as we all tend to do sometimes, miss the obvious. <br /><br />Anyway, as far as /. testing things at 2:45 in the AM, I do know for a fact that they have numerous offline and online beta servers that they use for testing changes. In fact, when they have new changes, in the past, they have always asked people to beat up the beta servers before they move the changes over to the live servers. <br /><br />I can only talk from my experience surfing their web site for the last 4 years.<br /><br />I guess, I wouldn't expect, even my best friend to call me at 2:45AM to see if /. is having problems, but, as you know, there are a whole lot of things between your browser and their servers. And then again, who knows, maybe their servers hick-up'd.<br /><br />Steve</div>
