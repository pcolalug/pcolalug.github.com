					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey any of you that are not aware of it the folks over at squishedmosquito.com have developed a remarkable scripting engine for web development. it has been ported for freebsd,linux and windows.<br />ought to check it out at escapade.org.<br />~brett~</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">ASP, ASP.Net, php3, php4, perl, tcl, adp, don't we have enough already? &nbsp;Well, if it will get me a job I'll learn it. &nbsp;No promises though...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">yea I agree there is a lot of scripting languages out there.<br />But you really ought to give this one a once over.<br />by the way This is the brain child of one of our members.<br />Ed Carp!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">What's also nice, IMHO about it is that, similar to Moto (http://www.projectmoto.org), you can write your dynamic pages, test them in interpreted mode, then compile them with gcc. I think this is relatively new to escapade, I don't know if its fully implemented yet, but I think its neato.<br /><br />Not to stoke his ego too much but Ed's got the m4d sk|llz, no doubt about it. Its neat to talk to him about coding and junk.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Since I wandered into this topic, I feel duty-bound to reply ;)<br /><br />Why yet another scripting language? &nbsp;suppose you're a newbie - you know some SQL, you know some HTML, and you want to do dynamic pages. &nbsp;OK, now what? &nbsp;ASP, PHP, Perl, etc. are, sad to say, horribly complex, and the ramp-up time is considerable.<br /><br />Escapade, on the other hand, is EASY. &nbsp;I'm not going to give you the marketing speech about how it's fast, simple, quick, and easy ;) &nbsp;but I will say that it has considerable advantages over most other scripting languages. &nbsp;Plus, we're working on a compiler for it - it's operational, although it doesn't have all the stuff that the engine has yet, the ultimate goal is for you to be able to take an Escapade page, run it through the compiler, and come out on the other end with an executable.<br /><br />If anyone wants to try out the bleeding edge engine, let me know and I'll give you the URL to the super-secret download site ;) - the one up on the web site is getting old, and so we're preparing for a major new release.<br /><br />In addition to the engine on the web site, the new beta engine has support for POP and SMTP commands, so it makes it pretty easy to write a web-based mailer. &nbsp;The first bare-bones mailer I wrote with the new engine took me a couple of hours to code and test, and it took about 5 lines of Escapade code to do it in. &nbsp;the new engine also has support for ASP-like sessions (which makes life a LOT easier!), and what we call preferences, which is just another word for named sessions.<br /><br />Yes, the engine is free. &nbsp;:) &nbsp;We've got current versions for Linux and FreeBSD, and an older port to Windows. &nbsp;The Windows port is a bit painful, which is why I'm leaving it for last :P</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey, could you post some sample escapade sources so we can get an idea what the language looks like? &nbsp;Also does it have any sore of templating system or some way of seperating the working code of a page from the visual layout stuff? &nbsp;<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sure:<br /><br />#<br /># Escapade code to pull records from a database and display them on a page<br />#<br />&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Records in table 'blah'&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&lt;body&gt;<br />&lt;DBOPEN &quot;dbname&quot;, &quot;hostname&quot;, &quot;login&quot;, &quot;password&quot;&gt;<br />&lt;IF &quot;$ERRORTEXT&quot; NE &quot;&quot;&gt;<br />&nbsp;Error opening database: $ERRORTEXT<br />&nbsp;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;<br />&nbsp;&lt;STOP<br />&lt;/IF&gt;<br />&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;field1&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;field2&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;<br />&lt;SQL select * from blah&gt;<br />&nbsp;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;$field1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$field2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;<br />&lt;/SQL&gt;<br />&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;<br /><br />Another example:<br /><br />#<br /># Escapade code to display messages in a POP mailbox<br /># Gathering login information is up to you :)<br />#<br /><br />&lt;POPOPEN &quot;hostname&quot;, &quot;login&quot;, &quot;password&quot;&gt;<br />&lt;IF &quot;$POPERROR&quot; NE &quot;&quot;&gt;<br />&nbsp;Error opening mailbox: $POPERROR<br />&nbsp;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;<br />&nbsp;&lt;STOP&gt;<br />&lt;/IF&gt;<br /># include a style sheet, if you want...<br />&lt;INCLUDE &quot;emailstylesheet.css&quot;&gt;<br />&lt;POPMSGS MSGNO&gt;<br />There are $MSGNO messages in your mailbox&lt;br&gt;<br /># Show messages in reverse order, last to forst<br />&lt;FOR I=$MSGNO TO 1 STEP -1&gt;<br /># just fetch the header at this point<br />&nbsp;&lt;POPHEADER $I&gt;<br />&nbsp;&lt;IF &quot;$POPSUBJECT&quot; EQ &quot;&quot; THEN POPSUBJECT=&quot;[no subject]&quot;&gt;<br />&nbsp;$I $POPSUBJECT $POPFROMNAME ($POPFROMADDR) $POPLINES $POPDATE&lt;br&gt;<br />&lt;/FOR&gt;<br /># reset POP so the messages don't appear read<br />&lt;POPRESET&gt;<br />&lt;POPCLOSE&gt;<br />&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;<br /><br />How's that?</div>
