					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I know it doesn't technically have Linux support yet but if you find SOME way of playing this game know that you HAVE to if you even remotely like RTSes.<br /><br /><br />This isn't just a game for fans of the famous table-top wargame (I love it, too, just can't afford it anymore) but really for anyone who loves a good RTS. &nbsp;I cannot describe the amount of ways this game is incredible short of saying that if you're only going to play one game this year this is it. &nbsp;Yes, more than Halo 2, more than Doom 3, more than Half-Life 2. &nbsp;Those are all flat-out awesome (or going to be awesome) but this is unbelievable. &nbsp;Just...unbelievable.<br /><br />If you've got the hardware you're going to love the graphics. &nbsp;It's worth sacrificing a bit of resolution to turn up the textures (I've got it at 1024x768 with full textures on everything so you know it's not TOO taxing) and it's shocking. &nbsp;Dead seirous it's like watching an animated battle of Warhammer 40K miniatures, complete with hand-to-hand combat, tracer fire, rockets, frag grenades, power fists, whirlwinds, dreadnoughts (aaaaahhh, the dreadnoughts), dropships, warp spiders, demons, cover, and much, MUCH more. &nbsp;<br /><br />Like RTSes but too much micromanagement of your base for you? &nbsp;Hate turtlers? &nbsp;Yeah, this game doesn't just kick that tired old formula's ***, it breaks its ****ing FOOT off in it! &nbsp;Can't turtle 'cause your base defenses...well, suck. &nbsp;That means there's only one thing to do and that's to get out there and SLUG IT OUT! &nbsp;There's no capturing of a gold mine and having a stream of workers pounding on it, no, you capture strategic points on the map while you're out hunting your enemies.<br /><br /><br />The online play is a dream come true. &nbsp;Bar none it's what I've always wanted; &nbsp;being able to play WH40K online. &nbsp;I just can't describe it, it's massive. &nbsp;Totally freakin' massive. &nbsp;Here's an idea of how massive. &nbsp;Say your squad (units? &nbsp;Heh, we build SQUADS here, not just units) limit cap is at 10 which is realistic for the beginning of the game. &nbsp;If you actually had ten squads that are maxed out with units (you can beef up their ranks while they're on the field, just push a button and minutes later you'll have a new unit bolstering the squad's ranks...I CANNOT describe how nice this is) then that means 9 people per squad...ten squads, nine people per squad, 90 FREAKIN' MARINES on the field! &nbsp;And that's small, but VERY easy to manage due to commanding whole squads.<br /><br />There is no greater joy as of late than getting up that 90-man force, taking it over to your opponent's base while they're out looking for you, and LEVELLING IT. &nbsp;Just flat-out LEVELLING it. &nbsp;I wish I could make some movies but Fraps is being...well, stupid right now (HUGE files...REALLY huge) just to show off the coolness but it'd probably fill up a DVD by the time I was done with 30-second samples.<br /><br /><br /><br />There's a demo out there, go out and grab it and find a way to play it. &nbsp;Bar none it's AWESOME.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Oh, I just played my first online battle today. &nbsp;2v2v2 people and me and my teammate WIPED THE FLOOR with the opposition. &nbsp;Just walked all over them. &nbsp;One team put up a fight against me but once my teammate held 'em off for a minute so I could get some troops up there we retalliated and devastated him.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">So i take it your slightly enthused?<br /><br />Does it have a linux version, or future planned linux support via either native or winex? &nbsp;<br /><br />I don't have windows right now. &nbsp;Please do not wave fish in front of the penguin, you will get bitten.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I loved this game, despite it being so freaking short! Why couldn't they develop a story line for the other 3 RACES! They could have made the story so much deeper and added at least 20 or 30 hours more gameplay. I haven't tried multiplayer and frankly don't have the time to, but 10 hours is way too short.<br /><br />[ Split to Debate Forum ]</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just did some checking around, apparently Dawn of War is playable in the latest Cedega. &nbsp;Well, I guess that'd be good news if I didn't already have a functional Windows Partition. &nbsp;Anyway, just thought you'd like to be updated.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey, new to the group (sadly, I don&#039;t have Linux on my HD now, due mainly to problems getting all the drivers going on my Dell laptop...).<br /><br />i see you are very enthusiastic about the 40K game - I bought it &#039;cause I used to be a regular player of the GW games.&nbsp; Graphically, the thing is a monster.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like playing it as much as I like watching it.&nbsp; I picked it up for 30 bucks in december (with the winter assault expansion).&nbsp; I&#039;d be more than happy to get together online with you and pit my feeble and inexperienced IG troops against whatever players may come.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t yet had the courage to get online and play with anyone - Commisar Yarrick would put a bolter shell through my head if he read this.<br /><br />Contact me and you can run me through the wringer - it&#039;d be fun to get in touch with some local gamers.<br /><br />Yours,<br /><br />Noah</div>
