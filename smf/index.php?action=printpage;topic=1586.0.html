					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The Steering Committee has the responsibility of ensuring that the forums are maintained in a manner conducive to civil discourse without resorting to indiscriminate censorship. The Committee shall, at its discretion, appoint certain members as moderators in order to provide assistance with this responsability. Moderators shall have certain editorial privileges with regard to the contents of all discussion topics in our forums. These privileges shall include the ability to edit, delete and relocate posts as well as the ability to lock, delete, and relocate threads of discussion. These privileges shall be exercised under the following guidelines:<br />[list=1]<br /><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><li>Posts that stray too far afield from a thread's general discussion should be moved to a more appropriate thread or used to generate a new thread.</li><li>Threads should be locked at the first sign of the discussion becoming unproductive, inflammatory, and/or abusive.</li><li>Deleting/editing posts should be a last resort. Moderators shall take great care in exercising this right and should get the input of other moderators if they are unsure.</li><li>In order to ensure moderator accountability, any modifications to a member's comments must include one of the following:[list=a]</li><li>An edited post shall include text indicating the moderator who did the edit, the time of the edit, and the reason for the edit.</li><li>A thread that has been moved to a different heading shall include a post by the moderator indicating the moderator who moved it, when the thread was moved, and which topic the thread was moved from.</li><li>A post that has been moved to another thread shall include text indicating the moderator who moved the post, when the post was moved, why the post was moved, and where the post was moved from.[/list:o][/list:o]<br /><br />Moderators must be nominated by at least one member of the Steering Committee. Unanimous approval of the Steering Committee, assessed via a poll in the Executives forum, is required for moderator status to be conferred on the nominee. <br /><br />If a moderator has been shown to abuse his or her privileges, moderator status can be revoked from the member via unanimous approval of the Steering Committee which shall be assessed via a poll in the Executive forum. Members who believe that they have had their posts moderated in error should report the action to the Steering Committee via Private Message or email.</li></ul></div>
