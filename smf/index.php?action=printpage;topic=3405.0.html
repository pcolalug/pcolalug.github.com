					Post by: <b>FlexBaud</b> on <b>October 08, 2008, 10:14:09 pm</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I am currently out of work. :-(<br /><br />I was doing IT until May/June when the company did a mass layoff (25% of workforce) and my job was cut. I was called back about 3 weeks later and offered a job in the call center, however, in late Augest I was let go again. Now I am finding myself stuck. I don&#039;t have a college education or any certifications but I do have IT Experience. <br /><br />Does anyone know any jobs I could try? I also don&#039;t mind traveling for extended periods. I read something about jobs in the middle east but can&#039;t seem to find anywhere to apply. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what to do at this point :-( </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have empathy for you.&nbsp; It is a tough time to be out of work.<br /><br />You may want to consider finding a job via a staffing agency, like Landrum Staffing.&nbsp; Of course, avoid the ones that want to charge you a fee.&nbsp; Also, if you are able to leave the Pensacola area, perhaps bigger cities like Atlanta may have more job opportunities than locally available.<br /><br />Good luck.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks. I am currently registered with Landrum Staffing but have not had any luck with them. The lady I spoke with told me outright that they most likely won&#039;t have anything for me. I&#039;m not even looking for anything in IT. I would like to have a IT job, but it&#039;s at the point where I would take anything I can get. <br /><br />I have applied for 50+ jobs since being out of work but have yet to find anything. I did consider moving to Ohio (Columbus) to be near my dad&#039;s family and I applied for 3 jobs up there, and all 3 called me and I still get phone calls once in a while from when I posted my resume on a Columbus job site. <br /><br />I just can&#039;t move away from Pensacola. I own a home here, I have lived here my entire life, I have family here. I like it here other than the job market and that would be the only reason I&#039;d ever move. <br /><br />I&#039;m just not sure what I&#039;m going to do at this point :-( </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I know cox is hiring right now.<br /><br />I went through a staffing agency by the mall, Express Personnel I think, but I have had a lot of luck with Man Power, it takes them about a week, but they almost always pull through.<br /><br />Good Luck!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Haven&#039;t been here in a little while but after seeing your post I thought I&#039;d reply.&nbsp; If you would like to send me your resume, I will see if there are any positions available.&nbsp; We usually have admin, programming, and IT sales positions.&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty tough around here for IT jobs with no degree but if you have some valid experience that can cover you.&nbsp; Just let me know.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">FlexBaud, Our company was just awarded a new contract in Kuwait. They are to start hiring next month, go to.. http://sh.webhire.com/public/591/ look under location find LOGCAP. There are some IT jobs. <br />&nbsp; Our contract has a hiring freeze now but it should lift soon. Everything is windozes. The Helpdesk jobs are fairly easy, no degree required, certs would be a big help, A+, Network+ or Security+. There is room to move up because no one stays here very long. I seen people go from helpdesk to site manager in a year. Most major companies are here.<br />Another place to check out is http://www.csakuwait.com/&nbsp; I don&#039;t know anything about them but they hire a lot of people.<br />Good Luck!</div>

Lots of questions. I&#039;ll answer them one at a time:<br /><br />Are you actually *looking* for a job?<br />Yes, I am. I have applied for 70+ jobs now and have had 1 interview, but did not get the job. I&#039;ve even went as far as applying for Wal-Mart, Gamestop, RadioShack, BestBuy, Etc. <br /><br />Have you posted a resume on any of the online career sites (for example, Monster.com)?&nbsp; <br />I&#039;m on Monster.com, CareerBuilder.com, PensacolaJobs.com, and HotJobs. I am also registered with Landrum Staffing, American Staffing, Kelly Services, Express Personal, and ManPower. <br /><br />Have you visited the EscaRosa Career Center (on L Street, I think) to see if they can help you?<br />I went there to file for umemployment which is when I was informed you cannot file unemployment there and she gave me a book which explained how to apply via US Mail, Phone, and Fax. She stated that they provide computers with internet access there so people can search Monster.com and other job sites, so I haven&#039;t been back over there since I can search all those sites from my home without wasteing the gas. <br /><br />Are you properly prepared for an interview on short notice if something was offered?<br />I keep my cellular phone with me at all times in case a job calls. I also have my &quot;suit&quot; ready. I have resumes printed out as well. My only limitation for a interview is my car. I was unable to pay for my insurance so I turned my tag in, and my car payment is past due and there is a device in my car which will not allow it to start when it&#039;s past due. My mom is also out of work right now so I can borrow a car when needed. <br /><br />Do you have nice printed copies of a resume ready to hand out?<br />Yes, at least count I had 15 copies printed. <br /><br />Do you have a list of references ready?<br />I don&#039;t have many references. I am not a social person and don&#039;t have many/any friends. However, I do have a few references. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, OK, sounds like you&#039;re doing most everything you can.&nbsp; Hopefully something will come up for you.<br /><br />Have you considered military service as a possible option?&nbsp; Good way to gain experience (and get college paid for), learn a lot about a lot of things, while earning a decent wage.&nbsp; Not sure how old you are, but it might be worth thinking about.&nbsp; They&#039;re hiring.&nbsp; &nbsp; :)<br /><br />Dan<br />(USN, retired)<br /></div>

I spent many many hours talking to recruiters and enllisted people and I have only heard postive things. My uncle is high up in the Navy (he&#039;s been in almost 30 years) and has also been trying to get me to go in and honestly, I all for it. However, I have two major things which prevent me from doing so. Number One: I am very overweight and short. I am 5&quot;4 and 210 lbs. I have always been &quot;larger&quot; than most people, even when I was in middle school I was 180 lbs, so I&#039;ve been having a very hard time losing weight. The next factor is... my credit. My credit is god aweful and is in the 400&#039;s right now, so I am not able to get any type of top secret clearance which limits me from the careers I want. I did think about the enlistment bonus and that would solve a lot of my credit issues... but getting enlisted is another road block. <br /><br />I have been working on my weight, since I have lost my job, I&#039;ve been going for walks every day and have even been using an excersise bike :-) If I can pull off getting my weight down, then sure, I&#039;ll join. My biggest regret now is that... I wish when I turned 18... I wish I went in back then, or at least went to college. :-( Instead... I got a job at wal-mart. <br /><br />I really need to get to one of the LUG meetings... I have yet to meet any of you. </div>

What would you have to do to prepare? As far as IT jobs, what kind of questions would you be asked that might be a surprise to someone? I know an interview is not like a test that you can study for, but if someone did get an interview, is there anything they can do to get ready for it?<br /><br />FlexBaud, keep working on your weight. Don&#039;t think of it as an &quot;all or nothing&quot; situation. Plug away at it one day at a time. You may miss some goals here and there, but if you keep heading the right direction (keep moving and eat less) you will get there. I lost 90 lbs in about 1.5 years and have kept it off for 3 years.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I was wondering how well received by the interviewer is it when you know a lot about the company. I guess that is always a good thing.<br /><br />Thanks for the tips.</div>
