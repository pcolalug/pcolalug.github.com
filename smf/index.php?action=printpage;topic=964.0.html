					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I haven't done it with a <i>linux</i> box, but I believe getty is the tool to get the job done. <br /><br />Some short browsing of tldp.org produced the Text Terminal HOW-TO (http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html). I glanced over it and I believe this may be what you are looking for. <br /><br />I might just look over it myself...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">agetty and a null serial cable is what I used to connect my Wyse terminal to my Redhat box. Worked like a champ. Check w/crowe, as he now has the terminal to see what the pinout should be. Something like 2-3, 3-2, 7-7 &nbsp;and 20-20 (for 25pin) should be all you need (You can surf the net to get the full pinout).<br /><br />Jesse</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have done it, connect my laptop to my router because it has no monitor / kb on it. &nbsp;Works fine, just had to uncomment a line in my inittab, and setup the right parameters on the laptop. &nbsp;Used a standard null modem cable sold at radio shack.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I currently have a wyse terminal hooked up to one of my machines... &nbsp;Like it's already been said, you'll need a null modem cable -- I don't recall just how I made mine offhand; your best bet for that would be to either google (http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=null-modem+cable&amp;btnG=Google+Search) for a wiring schematic, or to go purchase a prefabricated one.<br /><br />You might also need to install agetty or the like to make it work -- If I recall correctly, Redhat only comes with mingetty, which won't work over a serial line.<br /><br /><br />Hope this helps!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm not sure, but I think that's probably got dual serial connections not serial and parallel, at least I've never seen it that way.<br /><br />Would be nice though, isn't parallel faster than serial?</div>
