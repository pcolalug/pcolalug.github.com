					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That article didn't tell me anything except Microsoft isn't answering any direct questions about HP loading Mandrake on their prebuilt systems. The rest of it was FUD and manipulation of the highest order...and not from Microsoft.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you can't beat em, join em? The article has a bit of a childish tone to it. &quot;See! My OS is better than your OS because you didn't say otherwise!&quot;. Come on, do any of you that have been using an OSSOS (Open Source Software Operating System) really *care* if some marketroid or zealot says their product is better?<br /><br />Lets put it another way. Even if everyone in this group gave up OSS and went to Windows or Mac, slashdot became an MS PR factory, absolutely NO OEMs shipped Linux, and all the big boxed distros went under, I'd still use Linux on my desktop. Why? Because its better than MS? Because its &quot;morrally&quot; correct. Because I'm a satan-worshipping, pinko commie who won't pay for anything? Nope. Use what you use because it works for you and its fun. If thats Windows, great! For me its Linux and *BSD. We can still be friends.</div>
