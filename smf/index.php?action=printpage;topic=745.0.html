					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Since it seems that we have several RTCW and ET servers available within the LUG, why don't we all get together (virtually) tomorrow night to play one of these. I would like to try ET since it is free and has a lot more available. Maybe a repeat of last week...but this time, we'll actually play? 8:00 pm?</div>

The train one was a bit confusing, though. Lets do that again sometime soon. Better yet, wanna make Thurday at 8:00 Pcola LUG ET night?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Heck yes, by all means give it a try!!! &nbsp;If I had to hedge a bet though, I think you will have problems. &nbsp;ET is really graphics intensive.....I used to get pretty frustrated with on-line gaming with 56K, and to some extent with my old MSN DSL connection. &nbsp;After switching to cable a while back, all my game lag issues vanished. &nbsp;My advice is to get a cable modem, worth every penny. &nbsp;My ISP offers from 1/4 to full T1 speed. &nbsp;I went with 1/2 T1 &nbsp;at about 50 bucks a month because anything higher requires about 100 dollars a month....<br /><br />Narsil</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I pay about $45 per month for roughly 3 mb/s (megabit) downstream/300kb/s upstream connection. Of course, I have to deal with a dynamic IP and blocked ports. It is darn fast though.<br /><br />David, try it out and see how it goes. You might be able to get by with it, but you may experience some lag. the cool thing is, if you get laggy, you start jumping around on our screen too &nbsp;:P</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">IIRC, there are some things I can turn on at the server that attempt to make life easier for dial-up users. Someone remind me to look into it before Thursday.<br /><br />Also, David, for dial up, you can turn all of the graphics hoopla down as low as you can stand it. It won't help with network communication, but will help you reduce the amount of time your box spends drawing updates.<br /><br />And no, not Hatfields and McCoys, but more like younger brothers getting revenge, if those last two maps were any indication! And after all those times your sister and I got you out of class, ruggy!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi All,<br /><br />I will soon have my ET server up. &nbsp;Currently waiting on Fed-X to deliver a new CPU (Athlon 2200+) and motherboard for my Linux machine. &nbsp;After I get them, will set up the server to give us another battleground to gather on for kicking &quot;older brother&quot; butt. &nbsp;Have also put the machine on a UPS now, because I am tired of power losses destroying my Linux system. &nbsp;I should have done that after the last lightning storm that munched my hard drive.<br /><br />I will post the IP and server name after testing. &nbsp;That http://www.tcwo.com site Imnes told us about has the best prices I can find. &nbsp;Hard to believe that an Athlon 2200+ is only $69 and that a real nice motherboard can be had for $61 these days......but no complaints from me!<br /><br />Narsil</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, dialup stinks. I played tonight with the Windows version of the game using dial up to a game. It was really bad. I had everything turned down as much as I could. I don't think that the Windows version is running as snappy to begin with. Maybe I will get it going at Dad's house this week and can get on his cable connection. <br /><br />I just need a router and I can plug in there. Anybody want to loan me one for Thursday?
