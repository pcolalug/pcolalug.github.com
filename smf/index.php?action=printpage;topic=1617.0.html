					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">In order for this club to grow, it requires the membership to step up and contribute. &nbsp;So I lay down that challenge to all. &nbsp;If you think there is a topic that needs to be done or rehashed, at a minimum step up and make the request! Even better, do it yourself!<br /><br />A presentation only needs to be 20-30 minutes, realistically, with a 5-10 minute Q&amp;A session afterwards. &nbsp;If you do a slide show, you are looking at, on average, one slide per minute total. &nbsp;If you are already subject matter knowledgeable, it only takes an hour or two to prepare. &nbsp;If it is something you are challenging yourself on, it depends solely on how much effort and at what level you want to give your presentation.<br /><br />If you look at the Presentation list for this club, you will see the same names over and over for the rest of this year with the all of the remaining names being on the Steering Committee.<br /><br />http://www.pcolalug.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1593 <br /><br />Advantages to volunteering/presenting:<br />*Pride<br />*Community<br />*Furthering the local Gulf Coast support network for Linux<br />*Resume Bullets<br />*Better Command of the Subject Matter<br />*Practice Speaking in front of a great group of folks that think even my nervous stuttering is decent. :D<br /><br /><br /><br />Could somebody/anybody, not on the committee pick these up:<br />*Overview of the boot process and grub/lilo configuration.<br />*Linux on non-Intel platform for tinkerers (lots of interesting cheap hardware out there on EBay). &nbsp;There was a guy at the meeting last night and man am I sorry I forget your name, talking about Linux on Apple Powerbooks.<br />*Software administration overview: tarball v. gentoo v. rpm v. dpkg<br />*Gaming on Linux, ATI v. nVidia, and what's on the horizon, good places to get info<br />*You ever see those really cool KDE/Gnome/miscWindowsManager screenshots with awesome affects...HOW DO THEY DO THAT?<br />*Most of the major mail clients have good spam filters, but can we do more with say spamassassin?! &nbsp;I hate spam in most violent way possible -- please if you care, help me out.<br />*On just the more technical side of the house: how does current mail/web/dhcp servers work?<br /><br />Thanks for listening. &nbsp;I hope you take up the challenge and help me put the steering committee out of the presentation business.<br /><br />Scott</div>
