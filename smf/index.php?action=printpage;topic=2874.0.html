					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am ready to make the big switch from Windows to Linux, but I have less than no idea how to do this. where to go, what to download, how to install, how to move what I&#039;ve got to the new operating system, etc. I definitely need help and would appreciate anything, as long as its in civilian english. I&#039;m just a regular girl and I want to use my computer to shop/do research online, balance a checkbook, write school papers, keep iTunes and store digital pictures.<br />Should I just come to a meeting with a helpless look?<br />Thanks!<br />&nbsp;</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sure that would surely be a start. I am sure we could help ou decide on a distro for your needs and skill sets and build from there.<br /><br />P.S welcome to the group</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Most people would recommend starting out with a distribution of Linux that is new-user friendly, such as SUSE (http://www.opensuse.org) or Mandriva (http://www.mandriva.com). Both can be downloaded for free and have pretty good installers that do most of the heavy lifting for you.<br /><br />The first question is, do you have a cd or dvd burner available? This is important because you need to download the install discs and burn them to either cd or dvd. Obviously, if you have a dvd burner, dvd would be the better choice since you won&#039;t have to swap out discs during the install. Secondly, it would be a good idea to burn off some backup discs of everything that you absolutely need to keep prior to making any reconfigurations to your system. This is a good idea to do regularly anyway.<br /><br />The second question, do you really need iTunes? Unfortunately, iTunes doesn&#039;t run on Linux. This isn&#039;t such a big deal if you only use iTunes as a music player. If you have purchased songs from the iTunes store, you&#039;ll lose the right to play them unless they are loaded to an iPod. If you are only using iTunes to play music, there are tons of great media applications that I&#039;m sure you would be happy with. Some examples are amaroK (http://amarok.kde.org/index.php?set_albumName=album03&amp;id=cue&amp;option=com_gallery&amp;Itemid=60&amp;include=view_photo.php) and Rhythmbox (http://www.gnome.org/projects/rhythmbox/screenshots.html), among others.<br /><br />You do have the option to dual boot to make the transition if you like. Dual booting is where you have two operating systems loaded on your computer at the same time. When you turn the computer on, you decide which operating system (Windows or Linux) you would like to run. The advantage to this is that when you need something in Windows, you can still get to it. If you want to avoid the spyware, viruses, popups and other annoyances that go along with running Windows, you boot into Linux. The other good thing is that from Linux, you can access your files that are saved under the Windows part of the hard drive, in case you forget to back it up prior to loading Linux. You will need a program such as Partition Magic or Paragon Partition Manager to resize your Windows partition down to make room for Linux to install. These applications are not free (through legal means), but someone may have something that could help you out at the meeting. I must stress again that you absolutely must make sure you have everything backed up prior to making any changes to your computer&#039;s current configuration.<br /><br />Everything else will probably be an easy transition for you once everything is installed. Whether you run Gnome (http://www.gnome.org) or KDE (http://www.kde.org) as your desktop environment, you will likely find most of the apps easy to use. For internet browsing, you will probably be most at home using Firefox. For email, if you need an email client, Thunderbird, Kmail or Evolution work great as Outlook and Outlook Express replacements, if not doing the job better. OpenOffice.org is probably the most robust and complete replacement for the Microsoft Office suite with compatibility to view, edit and save MSOffice documents.<br /><br />So if you are sold yet, take a look at SUSE (http://www.opensuse.org) and Mandriva (http://www.mandriva.org) and decide which one looks better to you. Once you decide, head to one of these two links to download either the install cd set or dvd. Once you have those, you can use your burning utility to burn the iso&#039;s to disc. If you have questions, hit us up and we&#039;ll be more than happy to help.<br /><br />SUSE 10.1 Download<br />http://download.opensuse.org/<br /><br />Mandriva 2006 Free Edition Download<br />ftp://ftp.cise.ufl.edu/pub/mirrors/mandrake/Mandrakelinux/official/iso/2006.0/i586/<br />(Download the files Mandriva-Linux-Free-2006-CD1.i586.iso, Mandriva-Linux-Free-2006-CD2.i586.iso, and Mandriva-Linux-Free-2006-CD3.i586.iso for a cd install or Mandriva-Linux-Free-2006-DVD.i586.iso for dvd install)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yeah, what Rugmonster said...&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br /><br />Some good advice there, and we have &quot;resident experts&quot; on both Suse and Mandriva in the LUG.&nbsp; I think your idea of coming to a meeting would be the best way to start, and we&#039;ll talk things over with you and get the ball rolling.<br /><br />Glad to see (another) person wanting to switch, and welcome to the group!&nbsp; Look forward to meeting you (this coming Saturday!).<br /><br />Dan<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">iTunes doesn&#039;t run on linux, but SharpMusique does&nbsp; ;)<br />http://nanocrew.net/software/sharpmusique/<br /><br />I doubt it would be *easy* for a newbie to install, but it works.<br /><br />Also, I might suggest ubuntu...its a really nice distribution of linux.<br />http://www.ubuntu.com/<br /><br />Wellcome to the group,<br />Brent</div>

They have lots of GUIs for system tasks, but SUSE and Mandriva do a lot more hand holding. I was also thinking that KDE would be a better choice as a transitional desktop environment. But that&#039;s the beauty of Linux. You have a lot of different choices. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Perhaps soemone should bring a Live-CD distro to the meeting for her to try out?  Perhaps Simply Mepis?  I have Mepis running on an old PII 200, with 256 Meg of memory.  Not exactly blazing fast, but fast enough to get the job done.  Also, Mepis can be installed to the hard-drive.<br /><br />We&#039;re having a surprise birthday party for my Mom (she is turning 70), so I can&#039;t make it to the meeting, otherwise I would bring a Live-CD.<br /><br />Have fun.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I can&#039;t improve on Rugmonster&#039;s advice.&nbsp; Have been wanting to attend the group meeting in person.&nbsp; If I actually make it. I will bring the latest Mepis and Ubuntu live cds.&nbsp; Maybe something small too like DSL or Puppy in case she has old hardware.</div>
