					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've been playing with this CD-based distro for a few weeks now, and I've got to say it's a pretty slick way to introduce people to Linux, especially if you boot a few computers at your favorite computer emporium with it! &nbsp;It pretty much a standard tiny Linux distro with tinyX and IceWM and Dillo - but one of the really cool things you can do with it is to easily make your own custom distro! &nbsp;It's all script-driven- just download the DSL files you want in your distro, run the script, and follow the instructions. It took me about 15 minutes this evening to make my own custom distro :)<br /><br />Another thing I really, really like about it is that it has a &quot;toram&quot; boot-time option - when the distro boots, it copies itself into RAM before running, so once the system is completely up, all you have to do is pop out the CD-ROM and you're running diskless! &nbsp;Ideal for making a diskless router/firewall/web caching server. &nbsp;I haven't figured out how to make it boot over the network yet, but I'm positive it will do it.<br /><br />The other thing about the distro is that it's FAST! &nbsp;I'm running it in RAM on an old Toshiba 335CDS laptop - no hard drive, 96MB of RAM, and a 266MHz processor, and it still brings up a fully-populated X desktop from the command line in 10-15 seconds. &nbsp;Very cool :)<br /><br />I'm also running it on a eMachines T1090 desktop - 900MHz processor, 512MB of RAM, with the hard drive pulled out, and it's a perfectly acceptable desktop.<br /><br />It's based on KNOPPIX, so you don't have to install it to your hard drive to play with it, and the ISO is about 50MB, so it's not going to take you all night to download the distro. &nbsp;It also boots directly into X, so newbies can find their way around fairly comfortably, even on the stock distro.<br /><br />I like Mandrake 10 for my desktop, but DSL does everything I do from day-to-day - browse and do email - except for the programming stuff, but I ssh into the server for that anyway :)<br /><br />Hope to see everyone at the next meeting!<br /><br />[moderated 2:36PM CST 12/21/2004 by Rugmonster due to profanity in subject]</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I was wrong, I just brought X down and re-ran &quot;startx&quot; - on my 900MHz box, it took a total of 3 seconds from invocation to complete X desktop initialization. &nbsp;Pretty quick :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've always had problems with Knoppix. &nbsp;Invariably it starts to probe for SCSI devices and hangs there. &nbsp;Doesn't matter what distro of Knoppix it is, always does it.</div>
