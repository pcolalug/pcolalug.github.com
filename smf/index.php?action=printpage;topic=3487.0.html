					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have to say, Microsoft&#039;s business model isn&#039;t over (not yet at least).&nbsp; While it&#039;s true that linux has many advantages in certain areas, it also has quite a few shortcomings.&nbsp; Primarily in professionally developed software.<br /><br />The Linux platform is also the Linux model, it&#039;s free.&nbsp; Developers shy away from linux because it offers little financial incentive.&nbsp; For the average Joe six-pack user, who just needs to browse the web and maybe use some office software, Linux will be fine so long as everything they expect to have is freely available.&nbsp; So yes, for home use, linux does pose a threat.<br /><br />However, the uses for computers go far beyond those of the average user, and until open source takes over those areas Microsoft and other developers will be there to fill that void. Don&#039;t expect to see Photoshop, After Affects, or AutoCAD make their way to Linux any time soon.<br /><br />Capitalism <b>will</b> provide the best software, and if the incentive is more likely to be available on a platform they know, and where they know users are willing to pay for software, that&#039;s the platform they&#039;ll develop on.<br /><br />Microsoft also knows that as business computing goes, so does home computing.&nbsp; If a person uses Windows at the office, they&#039;re probably going to want to use it at home (after all, it&#039;s still cheaper to buy a Vista computer from Dell than an Ubuntu one).<br /><br />I also find it quite funny that Apple, the polar opposite of the open source movement in both philosophy and cost, is gaining grounds, but nobody ever seems to say that linux will be the end to their business model.</div>
