					Title: <b>Book for Returning Student</b><br />
					Post by: <b>rugmonster</b> on <b>February 17, 2005, 02:45:34 pm</b>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Due to the number of students we have here and folks who have been in school within the past few years, I would like to use your collective experience for my benefit. I am planning to return to college this summer after several years of being out of school. I wasn't ever a stellar student, but that was then. When I go back, I want to start with better studying techniques to make my time effective. With all that said, are there any books that you would recommend to aid me? <br /><br />I have looked into the book Becoming a Master Student by David Ellis (http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0618206787/ref=pd_sim_b_1/002-5357382-2520854?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;v=glance) as I've heard great things about it. Has anyone else read this book or have any others to recommend? Thanks guys. Now back to your regularly scheduled Linux programming.</div>
