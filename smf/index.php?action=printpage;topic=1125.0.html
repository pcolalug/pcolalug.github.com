					Title: <b>Book Review - Apache: The Definitive Guide (3rd Edition)</b><br />

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Book Review - Apache: The Definitive Guide (3rd Edition)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;This is a fairly comprehensive, 600-page guide to the Apache web server software. &nbsp;The book begins with an overview of what a web server and browser clients do, how they work, and planning/installing Apache. &nbsp;The book covers versions 1.3.x and 2.0.x, and the differences between them. &nbsp;After installation, the next few chapters explain the initial configuration required to get a working webserver, including the various directives blocks, access control, and setting up virtual hosts.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Chapter 5 discusses how to implement authentication, passwords, and more on access control, such as using .htaccess files. &nbsp;Following chapters describe how to change settings for various web filetypes, indexing, imagemaps, and redirection of web page requests. &nbsp;Chapters 9 and 10 explain using a proxy, and the multitude of logging and status options which can be configured.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;One of the longer (and important) chapters, Chapter 11, goes into excellent detail about the security aspects of running a webserver. &nbsp;It includes discussion and examples on signatures, certificates, using SSL, and firewalls. &nbsp;General security precautions, real life scenarios, and even potential legal issues are addressed.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The next section goes over building and administering a large website, and the issues associated with that. &nbsp;Also there is a chapter on adding web applications to your site to allow flexible user interaction, such as forms submission. &nbsp;There are then several chapters regarding add-ons and extensions to get even more from the webserver. &nbsp;These include PHP, CGI, Perl, mod_perl, XML, and Cocoon. &nbsp;There are numerous examples of coding provided, although most of them are somewhat basic in nature. &nbsp;One subject that I thought should have been addressed more was integrating the webserver with a database (such as MySQL), as this is a very common requirement.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The last two chapters go over the Apache Application Programming Interface (API), and how to write Modules for Apache. &nbsp;This may be useful to more serious developers, but is probably too technical and difficult for the average casual user. &nbsp;The book closes with a good Index and there is also a very handy foldout inside the back cover which contains quick-reference data for the most commonly used configurations and commands.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Overall this book seems to &quot;cover all the bases&quot;. &nbsp;It was useful to me as a beginner to set up a testing webserver, and yet has extra details and information for those more advanced webmasters. &nbsp;The quick reference section especially, should be very useful to experienced Apache users. &nbsp;I would highly recommend the book for anyone wanting to start or improve their knowledge in running the Apache webserver.<br /><br />* This review also submitted to Slashdot, Amazon, Barnes&amp;Noble, O'Reilly.</div>
