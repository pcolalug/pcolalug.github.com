					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I just installed 10.1 on my laptop.&nbsp; Will post a few pro&#039;s and con&#039;s after a couple of weeks useage.&nbsp; I did go ahead and setup Xgl.&nbsp; Let me tell you, it is too cool.&nbsp; Is anyone in the group using Xgl on a everyday basis?<br /><br />Lee</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I was running it on my laptop, but I was having a lot of sudden X crashes. Mind you, this was back when Xgl first came out and was included in the Ubunter Dapper Drake test releases. I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s come a long way in a very short amount of time. I plan on trying SUSE 10.1 out very soon.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I downloaded 10.0 the day before they released 10.1. I also installed it on a laptop, but haven&#039;t used it much yet. I was trying to get a wireless card to work with my wireless router and I think that the card is broken. SUSE looked nice enough that I&#039;ll give 10.1 a try in a few days when I feel up to downloading and reinstalling. I look forward to hearing the pros and cons.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">So far I have not had any X crashes seems to be stable.&nbsp; Not sure if I will be able to get use to the wobble effect though.&nbsp; I may change that setting.&nbsp; I will give it a few weeks to get use to it first.&nbsp; <br /><br />Lee</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well,&nbsp; I have had to nix Xgl for now.&nbsp; After putting the laptop thru some pretty heavy use today,&nbsp; I have had kill X several times.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think until it has the bugs worked out I will shelf it for now.&nbsp; I still think it is too cool though.<br /><br />Lee</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think once the bugs are worked out more, it really isn&#039;t practical for daily use. It&#039;s more eye candy and the fact that you lose some functionality of most window managers is a downside. I do like the Expose-style reveal and the task switcher, though. <br /><br />Was there anything in particular that was causing your breakage?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The biggest problem was, if you had multiple applications running and would minimize or select the title to move the app, &quot;every&quot; window you had open would disappear.&nbsp; You could not alt-tab or even cascade running programs.&nbsp; You had nothing.&nbsp; You could look at the running processes and it would be there running, you just could not switch too it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, I had problem with some default games and screensavers running slow, which usually run great.<br /><br />I myself, prefer to use KDE rather than Gnome (ok I can feel my ears burning now that I have said that) ;D So my problems may have been related to KDE.&nbsp; I did not set up gnome to run Xgl.<br /><br />Lee</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m seeing a lot of complaining about OpenSUSE 10.1. Mostly seems to be about how crappy YaST (still) is. Also, the new package manager, smart, seems to suck a whole lot. From what I&#039;ve read, it&#039;s a lot like apt, but seems to use the same apt repositories apt-rpm uses for SUSE. What&#039;s your opinion?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Smart seems like a good idea but is still under development (at least reguarding SUSE Enterprise 10).&nbsp; Hopefully they get all the bugs worked out.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never liked YAST but mostly because of the interface, I think it&#039;s a good tool just needs to be cleaned up.&nbsp; They are currently working on a GTK2 version, maybe they&#039;ll get to rework some of it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Xgl is improving quickly.&nbsp; My laptop has finally made the supported hardware list, and I haven&#039;t had a crash in the last month.&nbsp; (I&#039;m two releases behind though, will be installing the latest build tonight for testing).<br /><br />Nick<br /></div>
