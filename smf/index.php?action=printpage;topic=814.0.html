					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello, everyone. My name is Stewart Behymer I attended the meeting on Sat the 21st and enjoyed it. I am a Naval Officer at NAS P-cola. I was in the NFO Naval Flight Officer program. I am now on Limited Duty until Aug. and will be changing jobs in the Navy soon hopefully to Information Professional. So, I am trying to gain as much knowledge as possible and may ask questions that are not thought provoking. I am brand new to Linux. My Linux experience includes loading Red Hat 8, Mandrake 9.1 and Suse 8.2 which is what I think I will stay with for now. I have not played with it much but look forward to learning it. <br /><br />Stu<br />[/quote]Where ever you go there you are<div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote"></div></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm glad that you decided to join up, as they say in the navy Welcome aboard.<br />If you are still wondering about which disto to use, look up something called Knoppix. &nbsp;It is a distro that runs from the CD drive. &nbsp;Very useful to see if your hardware is compatable with Linux. &nbsp;Also look up a distro called Linuxinstall.org. &nbsp;It is the distro I am currently using. &nbsp;Very nice.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome phr0gman!<br /><br />We look forward to having you in the group. Let us know if you have any distro specific questions. Or, if you know specifically what you would like to do in Linux, we may be able to point you to a distro that will fit your needs better. Of course, we all have our opinions, so you will get several recommendations.<br /><br />You say that you are new to all this Linux stuff. Do you even know what we mean by a &quot;distro&quot;? (Probably should google for the answer on that one so that you don't end up looking too green).</div>
