					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Howdy folks, just happen to be surfing the net looking for a pcola IRC chat room when I found this site. &nbsp;I am new to Linux (Mandrake 10.1 to be exact) scene and need a little bit of help.<br /><br />I am trying to set up an apache webserver from my house to host my own website (http://thejernigans.net) but cant seem to get something configured right. &nbsp;I am having to use port 400 (thanks cox for blocking 80). &nbsp;On the box running apache http://localhost pulls up the default apache page but http://localhost:400 gets Could not connect to host localhost (port 400). &nbsp;If you like I can post my httpd.conf file here or email it to someone. &nbsp;Just let me know.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">you'll need to either host apache on port 80 and port forward, or run apache on port 400 specified in the httpd.conf<br /><br />http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/bind.html<br />http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/bind.html<br /><br />if you use the port forward route, all you need to do is set a port forward on your router, external port 400 pointing to internal port 80 to the internal ip address of the webserver.<br /><br />for just running apache on port 400, you'll want to change the listen to port 400<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"><br />#<br /># Listen&#58; Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or<br /># ports, instead of the default. See also the &lt;VirtualHost&gt;<br /># directive.<br />#<br />#Listen 400<br />#Listen server-ip&#58;400<br /></div><br />just add or uncomment Listen and set the port specified to 400 just in your httpd.conf as<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"><br />Listen 400<br /></div><br />and restart apache<br /><br />listen will allow you to listen on both 80 and 400 if that's what your wanting<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"><br />Listen 80<br />Listen 400<br /></div><br />this is of course for general apache config, can be a little different if you went into depth and setup virtual hosts.<br /><br />also, we have an IRC channel if you don't know already, check us out on irc.freenode.net<br />#pcolalug<br /><br /><br />and............<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"><br />#<br /># Port&#58; The port to which the standalone server listens. For<br /># ports &lt; 1023, you will need httpd to be run as root initially.<br />#<br />Port 80<br /></div><br /><br />about listen though:<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote"><br />The Listen directive instructs Apache to listen to more than one IP address or port; by default it responds to requests on all IP interfaces, but only on the port given by the Port directive.<br />Listen can be used instead of BindAddress and Port. It tells the server to accept incoming requests on the specified port or address-and-port combination. If the first format is used, with a port number only, the server listens to the given port on all interfaces, instead of the port given by the Port directive. If an IP address is given as well as a port, the server will listen on the given port and interface.<br /><br />Note that you may still require a Port directive so that URLs that Apache generates that point to your server still work.<br /><br />Multiple Listen directives may be used to specify a number of addresses and ports to listen to. The server will respond to requests from any of the listed addresses and ports.<br /><br />For example, to make the server accept connections on both port 80 and port 8000, use:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Listen 80<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Listen 8000<br /></div><br /><br />and I made this a lot longer than I should have lol</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Speaking from experience, if you have just home service vs. business service, they will shut your modem down in a relatively short time no matter what port you are running your web server on, as it is not in the &quot;terms of service&quot;. I don't know if they still have it available, but you may be able to get a SOHO account for only $20 extra which will let you run anything legal.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I looked into cox's home office plan for an extra 20 a month but was going to try and avoid that. &nbsp;I am running other things (webmin, ssh) just fine. &nbsp;I uploaded httpd.conf file if yall want to check it out when ya get a chance. &nbsp;<br /><br />http://fatsmokinhobbits.com/downloads/httpd.conf.rtf</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The problem I see is you are using the hopto.org in order to redirect the DNS entry for www.thejernigans.net . This service only takes request on port 80, and therefore won't work for what you are trying to do. Technically, what it is doing is proxying the request, meaning it takes the client request for http://www.thejernigans.net , requests the page from your server, and then returns the page back to the original client. In other words, the client never hits your webserver directly. If I had your current IP, I could probably test it by hitting it directly on port 400 (http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:400), which looks like it would work according to the httpd.conf you posted.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">My ip is 68.225.71.76. &nbsp;I am using No-IP.com since I do not have a static ip address. &nbsp;I do have it setup for port 80 redirect to port 400. &nbsp;Ill be on and off the IRC channel for most of the day if ya would like to hit me up there.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Looks like Cox is &quot;protecting&quot; you and not allowing inbound unsolicited traffic. Trying to get to that IP from both inside and outside the Cox network I'm getting hung up at the firewall/router on 68.1.11.2. The business class ip's for Pensacola are in the 68.15 subnet, so I'm pretty sure you're toast until you change your class of service.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Interesting... I was able to hit those servers from here as well. Try changing...<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"><br />&lt;IfDefine !APACHEPROXIED&gt;<br />Listen *&#58;80<br />Listen *&#58;400<br />&lt;/IfDefine&gt;<br /></div><br /><br />to<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"><br />&lt;IfDefine !APACHEPROXIED&gt;<br />Listen 80<br />Listen 400<br />&lt;/IfDefine&gt;<br /></div><br /><br />Also, you don't want to use virtual hosts unless you are running multiple sites and have proper DNS requests. Set your directive from<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"><br />ServerRoot /etc/httpd<br /></div><br /><br />to<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"><br />ServerRoot /home/web/www/thejernigans/main<br /></div><br /><br />Remember that when the No-IP request is not asking for the website by name (www.thejernigans.net), but by IP. Apache uses the actual HTTP GET header in order to determine which site is being requested. In the httpd.conf you posted, the HTTP header will never match because www.thejernigans.net does not resolve to your IP.</div>
