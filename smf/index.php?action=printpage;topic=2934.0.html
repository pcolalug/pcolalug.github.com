					Title: <b>Freespire First Release</b><br />
					Post by: <b>imnes</b> on <b>July 21, 2006, 07:05:17 am</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The first beta release of Freespire (http://www.freespire.org) is available for download (http://ftp.ussg.iu.edu/linux/freespire/). <br /><br />(http://wiki.freespire.org/images/8/85/Desktop3.png)<br /><br />OSDir has a  screenshot tour (http://shots.osdir.com/slideshows/slideshow.php?release=699&amp;slide=9&amp;title=freespire+beta+1+screenshots).<br /><br />I&#039;ve installed it on a machine, and it works really well.  You can use the linspire CNR service if you want, or the standard apt-get tools with it (or both if you want).  I&#039;ve installed some commercial apps through my linspire CNR service on it and it works fine.  (Cyberlink PowerDVD for Linux is a good legal DVD player for $9.95 if you have a CNR subscription).  The only &#039;bug&#039; I&#039;ve noticed is that when you try to play full-screen you can still see the KDE task bar, so you have to configure the taskbar to let other programs draw over it.  <br /><br />(http://images.linspire.com/application/pdv/357438/3_00_0809_20060421_0_0_0_50_linspire0_1/dvdplaying2.jpg)<br />http://www.linspire.com/lindows_products_details.php?product_id=25183&amp;pg=screenshots&amp;ss=2#bottomhalf<br /><br />Comes with the dev tools I use daily, Sun Java SDK (http://www.linspire.com/sun-j2sdk1.5) and Eclipse (http://www.linspire.com/eclipse).<br /><br />All the video files I tried playing have worked, they have legally licensed codecs on the system for free.  <br /><br />Worth taking a look at for anyone who likes KDE.  I wonder if the Freespire project will spawn a gnome variety?  <br /><br />Nick<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This is the first I have heard of Freespire (I have had my head in a hole for a while). From what I am reading, this means that Linspire will be marketing itself to more commercial use. Is that right? It seems that Linspire has tried to target the home user more than commercial, but now they are changing. Is this a bad thing?<br /><br />Freespire looks great. I ran Linspire (Lindows) a long time back. Was mostly impressed. Freespire looks like it is going the right direction.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Wow, it looked great in the screenshots. Promo pictures tend to always look good. What I found in reality was not so wonderful for my system or needs.<br /><br />Fonts were horrific in Firefox. They even include all the &quot;must have&quot; Microsoft fonts from what I understand. But, it did not look so nice on my machine. I assume that since the nVidia driver is part of the distro, that it saw my nVidia card and actually installed the driver. I have not checked.<br /><br />I basically have done zero tweaking on this machine because it is obvious to me that I will not be keeping the distro. So it may be able to look better, but it will not get the chance. If I happen to boot that machine up again, I will take some screenshots to post so you can see.<br /><br />Also, I had tried the Click-N-Run warehouse probably 5 years or so ago. Back when Lindows was new. It still had my login and everything in the system, which was cool. The downside to the CNR is that I wanted to give it a try before commiting to it. Now you have to give a credit card number for it to give you a few days trial. Which is not horrific, but I just did not want to have to go through that.<br /><br />The system ran slow on my box. It is a 1.4 Ghz machine. Not the fastest in the world. Also, I think I may only have 1/2 GB of RAM. So it may be a bit weak. But that machine is currently the Windows box in the house, and it runs XP Pro pretty well. So, I would expect a Linux to run fairly well on it. Seems to me that this is an indication of bloatware. What do I mean by slow? Well, general sluggishness. When you hit the launch button, it takes a second or so for the menu to come up. Programs did not take 2 minutes to load, but every time you go to do something, it is like it is transmitting the mouse clicks through molassas.<br /><br />I think it looks good and has even more promise now that it has been given to the community, but right now it is not working for me. Of course the community is balking about the fact that they include closed software in the distro by default. I am not sure how many of the serious Linux developers will be spending lots of time with this distro because of that. </div>
