					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">All types of malicious logic take advantage of vulnerabilities in specific operating systems and programs, or are programs that run on your system to do bad things. In order for those programs to run, they have to be built for that platform. For this reason, trojans, virus or other forms of malicious logic built for Win32 systems won't run on Linux, Mac OS X, *BSD or any other operating system. The same goes for ML built for Linux if you try to run them on other platforms. Even ML built for Linux on an Intel platform, it won't even run on a different architecture like PowerPC or Sparc because the binary is compiled to run on the Intel platform even if those other platforms are running Linux.</div>
