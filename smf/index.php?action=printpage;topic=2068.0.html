					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">kilar, I was thinking the same thing (ok, maybe not switch <i>entirely</i>). Those screenshots look great and the features sound really nice. Not that there's much there that couldn't be done in KDE, but its enough to makes me want to give it a spin.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Don't worry, peach. It'll take a LOT to make me switch from KDE on any sort of full-time basis. The point was, that prior versions of Gnome didn't seem to warrent even trying them out. Something about that overview just makes me want to try it after not having used it for a long time.</div>

I have tried it recently, and though there were some nice features being introduced (or improved upon) my problems with Gnome are more basic than it's feature set.<br /><br />But alas, this is not a bash Gnome thread. We are supposed to be congratulating them on a new release and giving cheers to the Gnome lovers of the world. So enjoy. If it makes you happy, I'm happy. I don't have to use it though; therefore, I'm happy.<br /><br />Cheers! Enjoy!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">well I've been running gnome 2.8 on my slackware machine for a few weeks and finally decided to clean everything up and reinstall my slackware install as originally it was a 9.x updated to -current and has been through gnome 2.4, 2.6, and 2.8.... everything worked then but everything works even smoother now with none of the old trash laying around<br /><br />I definetely like the ease of USB thumbdrives/harddrives and such as it's plug and play, it just works.....wasn't even plug and pray for me &nbsp;:lol: <br /><br />plugged the usb thumbdrive in and boom it showed right up and i was browsing it, comparing this to a year or so ago when I spent some time migrating to udev to finally get things to work easily.<br /><br />Gnome 2.8 has a good bit of nice features, I'm particularly starting to like the &quot;connect to server&quot; feature that allows you to have ssh/sftp/ftp/etc connections mounted directly on your desktop.</div>
