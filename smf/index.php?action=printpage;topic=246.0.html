					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay folks, dust off the calculus skills. &nbsp;I need some homework help. &nbsp;I have a take-home test due next tues. &nbsp;Allowed to get help from anyone I can, figured I'd try here since some of you guys have surely been through the maths.<br /><br />I'll post the problems, and my answers as I get time to work them. &nbsp;If someone could work them out themselves and verify my answers to be correct (or not) it would be very helpful<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">#3: Find the x-coordinates of the relative extrema of the function f(6)=2X+X^(2/3)<br /><br />I get Max @ X=-1/27<br /><br /><br />#4: Find the x-coordinates of the absolute extrema for the function f(x)=(X^4)+4X on the interval negative infinity to positive infinity.<br /><br />I get Min @ X=-1<br /><br /><br />#5: Use calculus to find the point on the line y=4x+3 that is closest to the point (2,-6)<br /><br />I get (-2, -5)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This is the last run of problems. <br /><br />#6 A rectangular plot of ground is to be enclosed by a fence on three sides with a river serving as a natural boundary for the fourth side. &nbsp;Under these conditions, find the dimensions of the largest plot that can be enclosed with 240m of fence.<br /><br />I got 120mx60m<br /><br /><br />#7 A box without a top is to be made from a piece of cardboard 1 foot square by cutting equal size squares out of the corners and then folding up the sides. &nbsp;What size squares should be cut out to get a box of the maximum volume?<br /><br />I got 2&quot; x 2&quot;<br /><br /><br />#8 In 1939, Joe Sprintz of the San Francisco Seals Baseball Club attempted to catch a ball dropped from a blimp at a height of 800ft. &nbsp;(a) How long did it take for the ball to drop 800ft? &nbsp;(b) What was the velocity of the ball when he caught it? &nbsp;By the way, the impact of the ball slammed his glove hand into his face, fractured his upper jaw in 12 places, broke 5 teeth, and knocked him unconscious. &nbsp;He dropped the ball.<br /><br />I got (a) about 7.07 seconds, and (b) about 154mph<br /><br /><br />#9 A train has 1200 passengers at a fare of $2 each. &nbsp;For every 10 cents that the fare is lowered 100 more passengers will ride. &nbsp;What fare should be charged to maximize revenue?<br /><br />I get $1.60<br /><br /><br /><br />This assignment is due Tuesday Night (nov 19), so if anyone has a chance to check any of these for me, just let me know. &nbsp;Thanks.<br /><br />Nick</div>
