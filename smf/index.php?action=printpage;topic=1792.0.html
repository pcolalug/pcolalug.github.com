					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">PLEASE, snide comments are not necessary. Seems that I have to preface each post to point out some of the smarmy members of this group looking to attack @ any given moment.<br /><br />Is anyone here familiar with filipino food, and if so, are there any restaurants that serve it on the Gulf Coast? I'd appreciate a recommendation of a restaurant if possible.<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don't recall if they're still open, but Loompia House on Navy/New Warrington was decent. &nbsp;I just returned to Pensacola from various assignments, so forgive me if you pull up and they're closed.<br /><br />Panda has buffet Oriental, if you want tons of crablegs pretty cheap.<br /><br />If you are talking about a real Filipino restaurant with karaoke, lots of loompia, and an owner named Raoul, I can not think of one here in Pensacola.</div>

Garden St (Corner of &quot;G&quot; &amp; Garden) Pensacola, FL 32501 Ph:(850)434-8383, Fx:(850)433-9173, Hours:M-F 11-6:30 SAT 11-3 SUN CLOSED<br /><br />LOREALE'S LOOMPIA HOUSE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (850) 457-9637 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />221 N NEW WARRINGTON RD<br />PENSACOLA, FL 32506<br /><br />I've never been to Mama's Best, but Loompia House is really good.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thank you for your kind reply and recommendations Kilar! &nbsp;I'll most definitely try it out. I saw that link for Mama's Best had a menu, and looks like that's the real stuff! I've been craving real fried lumpias and this soup that I used to have the oppty to eat called senegang (spg?) @ my filipino friends homes growing up. It's a sour broth w. cabbage and pork. Again, my thanks!<br /><br />Respectfully yours,<br /><br />ms</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You can also try Manila House on Fairfield across from the old Mariner Mall.<br /><br />Let me know if the food you get is good wherever you go, so I can compare.</div>

Neat clean place. Service was fast. Food was excellent! Has pancit bihon (sooo good!), crispy fried lumpias, fried chicken wings, and rice.. had leche flan for dessert.. My companion had chicken teriyaki w. steamed vegetables, and steamed white rice.. It was all extremely fresh!<br /><br />Definitely going to go there again. I've also tried Loompia House &amp; Manila Garden a while back.. Was not very happy w. Loompia House, not much very appetizing to me from their buffet.. Manila Garden was definitely better than Loompia House. I enjoyed Mama's Best overall.<br /><br />Have fun!</div>
