					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, here is some info that I have found out. We were discussing before in a post about the OpenOffice.org HTML editor (http://pcolalug.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=99), how I would like to be able to set a site root. I think I have found a program that does this.<br /><br />My argument before was that most WYSIWYG editors do not allow you to set site root, and therefore you have to code in the whole path to an image to get it to display. With a text only editor this is not that important (except when you do a preview). I think I have found a program that helps with that. It is Screem. <b>S</b>ite <b>CR</b>eating and <b>E</b>diting <b>E</b>nviron<b>M</b>ent.<br /><br />It allows you to set site root and it has a preview pane that will let you see the page as to how it might look in a browser. Of course each browser is different. It will allow you to specify an external browser as the preview browser. Doing this though, I am not sure that your links to other pages and images will work right. You have to use the internal browser for that.<br /><br />Screem is written for GNOME. It works well with KDE too. It loaded with Mandrake 9.0rc3. <br /><br />Any other HTML options you would like to throw in, please feel free. (I mostly just use vi though)<br /><br />David</div>

Here is the Screem page (http://www.screem.org/index.php).<br /><br />It was part of my recent Mandrake update, so I figured everyone else already had it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I couldn't get the Mandrake update to work. &nbsp;Oh, maybe its because <i>I</i> use SuSE &nbsp;8) . &nbsp;Thanks for the link! &nbsp;BTW, Quanta Plus (http://quanta.sourceforge.net/) does have similar features. &nbsp;They were working on a WYSIWYG feature, last I checked. &nbsp;Its a KDE app too.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The problem that I have with Quanta Plus is that I have not figured out a way to set site root.<br /><br />I do like it better in many other ways. Quanta Plus seems more well developed.<br /><br />David</div>
