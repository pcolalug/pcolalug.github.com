					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have another 4 years and 10 months left on my enlistment in the world's greatest Air Force (*chuckle chuckle*) and I have no intensions of staying in past that mark. I want to stay an admin when I get out, but I'm scared that I will get stuck doing MS server admin. Before I came in, I got two years experience administering a small ISP's linux boxes and now I get to administer BSDi based firewalls in my current job. However, much of my job outside of those firewalls is administering a majority of MS NT and 2000 servers. <br /><br />What do I need to do to prepare myself for a civilian job and one that isn't MS server focused? I try to do as much as I can at home, but I know much of that experience doesn't count since it is play at home. I also can't simulate the live environment of production servers without paying major cash for multiple systems and equipment. When I go to look for a job, do I look for the assistant admin positions or go for whatever I can get, even if it means admining a bunch of MS boxes? Do I go ahead and look into getting some linux certifications such as the LPI (http://www.lpi.org/) and Comptia's Linux+?<br /><br />I have a lot of time to worry...I mean think about this, but I just don't want to get stuck in the AF because I had no plans or way to make a living. I love my job, but I don't like the rest of the crap that goes with military life.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Certification, Certifications, Certifications. Oh, and a Computer Science degree doesn't hurt. You can get Linux certifications as well as Unix certifications. I believe that the security certificatiosn are going to be the big ones in the future, though....<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">YEP! Degrees prefer B.S , and Certification Networking and Security are the big ones. by the way I use to work for DANTES and am aware of several diffrent schoools offered to enlisted personnel thru the Distance learning Program. Check with your command for whats available<br />Brett</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have to complete my Career Developement Courses as part of my job, but once I'm done with that, I am planning on starting on college. My previous transcripts are absolute crap, so I am planning on starting fresh. I am looking at UMUC (http://www.umuc.edu) which is a part of the University of Maryland. They offer a B.S. in Computer Information and Science which sounds pretty much like your typical CIS. Here (http://www.umuc.edu/prog/ugp/majors/cmis.shtml) is an overview of the program. I have asked Randall about this, but you know those darned CS majors always think CS is the way to go. I have passed up my opportunity for a traditional college education unless I want to be in school for 8 years, unless I find a sweet, rich lady who is willing to put me through school and support me once I get out. <br /><br />Also, I have thought about getting the LPI level 1 and also working on the Cisco track of certs. The LPI's are pretty inexpensive, but I don't want to get them too early and have to recert before I get out. I also thought about continuing my Comptia track and fill out with Net+ and Linux+ since I've already got the A+. I also thought about picking up a Sparc and playing around with it and look into what Sun has to offer. What are some other good certs to look at? I will be depending on those and my 8 years experience when I get out since I probably won't have my BS done. Opinions?</div>
