					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I'm once again making an attempt at using FreeBSD for my network server. The box did have Debian Stable on it, but have become incredibly frustrated with it. You shall hear no more evangelism from me on the wonders of Debian...at least until they come out with Sarge and I can play with it some. <br /><br />The goal is to have this FreeBSD box serve as a network authentication server running OpenLDAP initially and possibly adding Kerberos later on, Apache with PHP and mod_ssl, and mailhub. I may or may not put a mysql on here. It depends on what happens and what I need. This may seem like a lot, but this is for my home network.<br /><br />Eventually, I plan on implementing some sort of network file system. It is looking like AFS is going to be what I use over Coda or NFS. If I use that, then Kerberos will definitely be going on the network. And yes, much recompiling will be done :P<br /><br />I'll keep everyone posted on the outcome and the difference I notice between common Linux and FreeBSD.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've gotten FreeBSD 4.8 on my server now. &nbsp;Currently with mysql + apache, sendmail, wu-ftpd, samba.<br /><br />If you need help with anything let me know. &nbsp;If I do I'll bug you for it :)<br /><br />5 days of uptime and counting :) &nbsp;Probably won't last, it's not on UPS anymore :( &nbsp;I think my max was around 130 days for slackware before a long power outage took it down.<br /><br />Nick</div>
