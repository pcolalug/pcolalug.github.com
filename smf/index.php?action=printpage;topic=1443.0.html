					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey guys.<br /><br />This is my 2nd time trying to install wine and...well it's being a butt again. &nbsp;I compiled it using wineinstall. &nbsp;However, it doesn't find my win 2000 install. &nbsp;Secondly it can't seem to find the fake C:\ which it just made.<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"><br />Preparing to install default Wine registry entries...<br />Installing default Wine registry entries...<br />&nbsp;<br />Could not stat /root/.transgaming/c_drive &#40;No such file or directory&#41;, ignoring drive C&#58;<br />Invalid path 'c&#58;\windows' for windows directory&#58; does not exist<br />Perhaps you have not properly edited or created your Wine configuration file.<br />This is &#40;supposed to be&#41; '/root/.wine/config'<br />Registry install failed.<br /></div><br /><br />This is something like the problems I had with wine the last time I tried to install it. &nbsp;This bugs me just about as bad as mplayer not having a default front end. &nbsp;(those of you who have tried compiling it know what i mean).<br /><br />btw this is winex 3.0-pre1. &nbsp;I wanted to play games like civilization 3, and such with it. &nbsp;I'm gona try before I buy cause it's subscription based<br /><br />--ps-- <br />I just had to add this.<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"><br />bash-2.05b# mkdir /root/.transgaming/c_drive<br />mkdir&#58; cannot create directory `/root/.transgaming/c_drive'&#58; No such file or directory<br />bash-2.05b#<br /></div></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">A while back i did a cvs install of winex which actually worked out pretty nicely except for it took a few fixes to get my mouse working in delta force - task force dagger<br /><br />the cvs version is actually free and legal....or atleast it was when i did my cvs install....can also try snatching the latest winex 3.2 or 3.3 or whatever it is now off a p2p network :wink: 3.0 is a little old so probaly go a little cleaner with latest</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Do you have /root/.transgaming? If that doesn't exist, then you need to make that before you make c_drive.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Or do like me, pay $5, get the installable package with the nice Point2Play app, and support the effort.<br /><br />I think you don't get all the software in the CVS version, because I have apps that will run through the prepackaged files but won't run properly through the CVS. &nbsp;I'm not sure what is missing. &nbsp;My guess is they are licensing some commercial code / DLLs to include that they can't redistribute in source form.<br /><br />Nick</div>
