					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Howdy,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Does anyone know where there is a Prometric testing center in the Pensacola area?<br />&nbsp;I searched and found some computer training place and I wrote them and they said they don&#039;t give them. Then I found something about George Stone does, but couldn&#039;t find anything on there site about it either. AARRGG!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I found New Horrizon&#039;s listed as a Prometric testing center, but they said they don&#039;t give the cert tests! Whatever. I also found Global Business solutions Inc. I emailed them and will wait and see what they say.<br /><br />I received a email back from Global Business solutions Inc., they said they do give the exams. I wrote to see if that includes Sun certs to to be sure.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">We have not published it yet as we are still installing the equipment but we will be doing Prometric testing at PJC.&nbsp; It could be a early as next week!&nbsp; Call the Pensacola testing center and ask for the director to inquire.&nbsp; The number is at the bottom of this link:<br /><br />http://www.pjc.edu/students/services/testingCenter.asp<br /><br />Hope that this helps.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">DoberLinux, OK coo,l thanks for the info.<br />I never heard back from Global Business solutions. The guy asked me which exam and I replied twice and he never answered.<br />As far as I know, once you set up to give the tests you should be able to give anything offered by Prometric. But maybe I&#039;m wrong?<br />Alan<br /></div>
