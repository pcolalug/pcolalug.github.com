					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi all,<br />I'm thinking about taking some classes for a Linux certification, and wondered about this particular one:<br /><br />http://oreilly.useractive.com/courses/linux.php3<br /><br />It's offered online via the Univ of Illinois - anybody know anything about it? &nbsp;Any opinions on the value of something like this towards future employment? &nbsp;Thanks for any info you can provide.<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Not sure what kind of weight that cert would carry with any future employers. &nbsp;Maybe sticking to something more widely known like RHCE or something?<br /><br />I think CompTIA has a linux certification too.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The CompTIA certifications don't hold a whole lot of weight with me. I haven't looked into the RHCE too much, but I want to get the LPIC (http://www.lpi.org/en/home.html). From everything I have read about the LPI series of certifications, they are hard to get, but definitely show you know your stuff. Go to their site and check out the tests they have available. I will be getting the O'Reilly's book that the library has, LPIC in a Nutshell next payday. Yes, it is out-dated due to a new release of the test, but it does have some good study material.<br /><br />Along with having linux certifications, I think it would do you good to learn more of the other &quot;unix-type&quot; environments, such as the BSDs and Solaris. Sun has some good certifications, but Solaris doesn't always play nice on x86 hardware. I've always been told that to get a real Solaris experience, you need a Sparc...and make sure you get something that is new enough to run the newer versions of Solaris. I just paid the $20 to download the &quot;free&quot; release of Solaris 9 for x86 and I'll let you know how it goes. Back to the point, it seems that in the unix world, to be marketable, it is good to have a broad background. The core concepts are the same, but knowing the differences and having experience with them all helps.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've had mixed experience with certification and Linux. &nbsp;I think getting a certificate and deciding which one to get should mostly be driven by the type of company you'd like to work at. &nbsp;Usually the only places that really want certification are pretty bureaucratic. &nbsp;Many other linux houses will just put you through some solid technical screening to determine if you're up to the task of working there. &nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;If you are definitely sold on getting the certification, deciding which one might be best done by perusing Monster and other job boards for a while to see who wants what. &nbsp;I know that quite a few companies run Redhat exclusively because it offers business-backed support. &nbsp;I think this helps increase the value of the RHCE cert since it will mean good things to a redhat-based company. &nbsp;The RHCE is also pretty cool because you are tested against real boxes with real problems. &nbsp; I can't comment on the LPIC because I don't know much about it. From what I can tell, it's just a computerized standardized test, so I dunno. &nbsp;The O'Reilly courses seem to be novice-aimed, but the syllabi look pretty comprehensive. &nbsp;I imagine the O'Reilly cert. coupled with some small business work experience would probably go over rather well.<br /><br />Good luck!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for the input, everyone. &nbsp;I'm going ahead with the one I mentioned, largely due to the fact the the good old U.S. Navy will pick up 100% of the tab... &nbsp;Signed up today and should be starting in a week or so, after the red-tape gets done.<br /><br />Ruggy, just FYI - (you may already know this)... &nbsp;The Navy's Tuition Assistance program is paying for this, and I would think the AF has the same thing. &nbsp;It's 100% tuition/labs, up to 12 credit hours per year, or 18 Continuing Education Credits per year. &nbsp;Too good a deal to pass up...!<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">:shock: <br /><br />This can be covered by TA? I'll check into that tomorrow.<br /><br />And, oh yeah...<br /><br />You realize you can do all of those in 1 year. I think the TA cap for us is $4200 a year, so that falls under that too. Interesting...</div>

Interesting...</div><br />Yup. &nbsp;From looking at the course syllabus, I think I already know everything in the first two courses, so they'll be quick. &nbsp;And, the TA office here said they'll pay for all four right up front, so the whole thing will count against this fiscal year. &nbsp;That means that as of October 1, I'll have a clean slate to use more TA... &nbsp; :D <br /><br />Feels good to start gettin' sum skoolin. &nbsp; :wink: <br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Since you guys can have Uncle Sam pick up the tab check out Red Hat's e-learning courses. &nbsp;RH outsources its e-learning courses through a company called digitalthink.<br /><br />http://www.redhat.com/training/<br /><br />Chuck</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thought I'd write a quick update on this subject, and pass along an email I got from O'Reilly...<br /><br />I'm currently on the 3rd (of 4) online course offered by O'Reilly/Useractive, through the Univ of Illinois. &nbsp;I have found the first two courses to be pretty easy (except I had a hard time with DNS/bind/named). &nbsp;I'm now learning email systems and webservers, and it's a little more challenging and very interesting. &nbsp;I would say these courses are aimed at the beginner to intermediate level, and I have found them valuable. &nbsp;Anyway, O'Reilly is now offering a price reduction on the courses - I've included the email from them below. &nbsp;Be glad to answer more specific questions on these courses if you have any.<br /><br />Dan<br /><br />-------------------<br /><br />Special deal alert--we're offering a 50% discount on the Linux/Unix<br />Certification Series from the O'Reilly Learning Lab. &nbsp;With this User<br />Group-only discount, your members can save nearly $1000 on these online courses. And everyone who completes the four-course series earns a University of Illinois System Administration Certificate. This offer<br />ends November 1, 2003.<br /><br />Why Learning Lab? We partnered with Learning Lab two years ago because we felt they'd created the best online learning environment we'd ever seen. Every class includes compelling, hands-on content, root access to a Linux server, an online coach, and a free O'Reilly book.<br /><br />Want to let your members know about this special 50% discount?<br /><br />To enroll for the the Learning Lab Linux/Unix Certification Series go<br />to: http://oreilly.useractive.com/linuxa/<br /><br />Please use the code ORALL1<br /><br />We've created a set of web site banners and text announcements<br />that you can use: http://ug.oreilly.com/banners/learninglab/<br /><br />We hope your members find these courses a convenient, enjoyable way to go 'Back to School.'</div>
