					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here&#039;s an edited version of what I sent to alan.&nbsp; Maybe it will help some of you looking for positions:).&nbsp; It rambles, but I don&#039;t have time to edit to make it read properly, sorry:).<br /><br />First thing, formatting.&nbsp; Try look at sample resume&#039;s online.&nbsp; Monster has some good samples that translate into rtf format.&nbsp; Make sure your resume highlights what an employer is look for.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for skills, of course, but I&#039;m also considering longevity; how long do you stay with a position?&nbsp; a year or more is ok, 3+ gives you bonus points.&nbsp; less than year in multiple positions back-to-back looks like you either don&#039;t know what you are doing or you have inter-personal issues. If those are contract positions, list them as contract positions so employers know you weren&#039;t bailing.<br />&nbsp;<br />Second, only list your jobs if they have relation to the position for which you are applying.&nbsp; List primary accomplishments you made while in those positions.&nbsp; Always strive to make &quot;accomplishments&quot; while in a position.&nbsp; Did you institute a new means of virus alerts to help increase response time?&nbsp; That sounds MUCH better than &quot;virus scans&quot; . which are scheduled from the server to run automatically and any good home user does regularly. <br />&nbsp;<br />Third, always state your professional goal (pursuant to the position for which you are applying, of course).&nbsp; This is actually part of #1.<br />&nbsp;<br />Summarize your skills into positions:&nbsp; ex. &quot;Manned HelpDesk for software/hardware issues.&nbsp; Noted for proficiency and friendliness.&quot;&nbsp; The last part could simply be from a supervisor sending you an email saying you did a good quick job and someone had reported that you were nice to them. . .it doesn&#039;t have to be an award or anything. <br />&nbsp;<br />A statement like that lets employers know you have helpdesk experience.&nbsp; Every business has different software/hardware, but listing it as &quot;helpdesk&quot; says, &quot;I know how to handle people and problems in a timely, courteous manner.&quot;&nbsp; See the difference between that and listing that you have hardware and software skills? <br />&nbsp;<br />Basically, think about what the employer is looking for.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for someone with basic tech skills, someone else may be looking for a different set of skills, but what sets you apart is your ability to make things happen, your ability to make things better, your ability to treat the customer/end user the way YOU would want to be treated.&nbsp; Interpersonal skills, forethought and planning are critical in IT at all levels.&nbsp; If your resume can show those items in some small manner (not overly focused on them, but allow those bits and pieces of how you handle yourself to come through), then it will definitely help you in getting to the interview process, where you can give as much detail as you want. <br />&nbsp;<br />Hope this helps . . .the main thing I would do is formatting.&nbsp; Make it look &quot;professional&quot; with a proper. standard layout.&nbsp; I am only looking at four resumes, but if someone is looking at 15-20, the most professional will stand out, regardless of skills.&nbsp; You get that first look by following proper form and allowing the person reviewing your resume to quickly assess &quot;who you are&quot; in a format they are already familiar with. This puts you on &quot;familiar&quot; ground . ..unfirm as it may be, and then you will get reviewed for skills. <br /></div>
