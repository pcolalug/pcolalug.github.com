					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">When?<br /><br />LAN party!<br /><br />I could sweet talk Mom and Dad into letting us use their house. We have capability to have 10 computers patch into the network. We also have a wireless access point.<br /><br />Has the makings of a great evening (middle of the night, early morning). &nbsp;I have time each day till Tuesday to put this together. <br /><br />If not this time, we could plan something in the future. <br /><br />Funny, I was just thinking of a LAN party yesterday.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I was thinking of online like the internet, but I like the way you think! &nbsp;LAN party sounds sooooo cooool. &nbsp;Now will it be restricted to games you can run on Linux natively? &nbsp;I do have Heavy Gear II as well. &nbsp;Anyone looking to play wolf tonight can look me up. &nbsp;I'm New_B.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">We would not have to limit it to just Linux games, but that would be nice. I don't know of any great Linux multiplayers besides Quake, and I don't have it.<br /><br />Never have gotten into that.<br /><br />Steve, if you have more information on TechAdvanced's LAN party, I would be interested if I am in town.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Return to Castle Wolfenstein is Linux native and a total blast in multipllayer. &nbsp;Just in the demo, you get to storm a Nazi bunker complex, Invasion of Normandy style. &nbsp;There is also a capture the flag style map that has you running around in a complex of trenches and small fortifications. &nbsp;The action is fast-paced and a bit midless, but if I want to think for fun, I'll hack Lisp. :wink:</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">RtCW is great. &nbsp;I haven't tried the linux version, but the windows version was great. &nbsp;<br /><br />I'm into RedFaction (windows) right now. &nbsp;I'm definitely interested in a lan party. &nbsp;How many would want to attend?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just so you all know, there is a linux version of Unreal Tourn. and CounterStrike (woot!). &nbsp;If you have a linux game lan party, you at least need to break out the counterstrike. :)</div>
