					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Is it a government coverup?<br />Is it a publicity stunt for a new movie or book or game?<br />Is it a conspiracy nut?<br />Is it ... well, you get the idea. &nbsp;It's an entertaining read if nothing else. &nbsp;I'll leave it up to you guys to decide.<br /><br />I especially like the part about &quot;My mouse cursor moved, I knew I was being hacked!&quot;<br /><br />Well, without further ado...<br /><br />http://www.8march2003.com<br /><br />Nick<br />imnes@go.com</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just couldn't bring myself to bookmark the site. I love a good conspiracy yarn as much as the next guy, and I admit to being curious. This beeing said, it feels kinda hokey to me. Waitaminute. I'll bookmark it. Why pass up the chance to be entertained? Better yet, lets elect imnes our oficial conspiracy officer!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, the domain name was registered through an anonymous registrar. &nbsp;But I don't know how anonymous you can really be, unless you're paying your hosting fees and domain registration with cash, in a dark alley, at night :) &nbsp;<br /><br />I guess he could have had his 'friend' take care of all of that for him though. <br /><br />I'm interested to see what (if anything) gets posted in march.<br /><br />Nick<br />imnes@go.com</div>
