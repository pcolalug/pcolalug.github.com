					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Not sure if anyone watches Screen Savers but they demoed a really cool program tonight. <br />It's called Synergy (http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/).<br /><br />This program allow you to use a keyboard and mouse attached to one computer to work with two computers. It does this through TCP/IP. Right now, I have my Windows computer and it's monitor on and I'm using it's keyboard and mouse to type this message ON MY LINUX COMPUTER. I just drag the cursor to the left side of the linux monitor and it jumps over to my Windows computer's monitor. I can cut and paste text between the two monitors, also. This is one awesome program. It works with Linux computers and Windows computers.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have the site bookmarked, but I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to use it. My linux box and my domain controller are going to be hiding away in a closet soon and my laptop is the only other system I have sitting out. I do have my old 19&quot; monitor that I would like to use with the laptop when it is on the desk, and I could run this rather than hook up another mouse and keyboard then. I'll let you know how it goes after I get everything setup either later today or tomorrow.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">While it sounds neat, I have to ask. &nbsp;Whatever happened to simply using a KVM switch? &nbsp;Personally I think my two-sided KVM switch from Linksys rocks and has served me well when I just need to talk with two boxes and only one set of peripherals.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have not used this product because my situation is different and a KVM serves me well. But I can see a couple advantages of this over KVM in some situations.<br /><br />The main thing is that you have two monitors. You can view the contents of one computer while working on the other. Cut from one computer and paste to the other. Neither of which you can do with a KVM.<br /><br />I use KVM only when I am testing a new box to be put out on the network. My administration is either done through a web interface or physically at the computers.<br /><br />Also, with KVM, you typically think of physical closeness of the boxes in question. With this, as I understand it, it could be any two computers on your network. No matter how close or far away they are.<br /><br />Pretty cool concept.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">For me, there are times that I would like to have two displays, but only one keyboard and mouse. The KVM only allows you access to one system at a time, so I can see how this could be nice. I'm just curious how it deals with dual displays. I'll have to try it out and see.</div>
