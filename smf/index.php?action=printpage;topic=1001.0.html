					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Danc I read your post and followed the links. I think Mandrake is the best distro for home users. No other distro caters to the home user desktop like Mandrake does at least as far as I know. After reading the articles I still don't like it. It is so &quot;Microsoftish&quot;. What will they do the next release? I want to see linux improve and become common on desktops but I don't want to see it become a tool for advertisers and businesses to invade your space like the telemarketers do. I posted my feelings on the Mandrake Club and I would encourage other Mandrake users or any linux user for that matter to let Mandrake know how they feel pro or con. To me this goes against the grain of what open source is about and that is freedom to choose.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just my 2 cents.<br /><br />If everyone that downloaded/leached Mandrake for free and ran it as their normal desktop were to go out and buy it, then I think Mandrake would have more money then they knew what to do with. As it is, most Linux downloaders use it because they don't believe in paying for their software. That's what's going to kill/stop Linux from becoming a mainstream OS.<br /><br />I have posted to Mandrake numerous times that I think they should only put the new distro out for download after it's been on store shelves for a couple of weeks. This way, the leachers will buy it because they can't wait for the free version.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Unlike a lot of the smaller distro's, Mandrake is providing jobs for people. &nbsp;So if they need to place ads to help pay for it (since most of us aren't paying a dime for our software) then I'm all for it.<br /><br />Google is paid for by ads on every page and it doesn't bother me, so as long as they follow suit and don't make it annoying then it's ok with me.</div>

How is not paying for software going to make it not be mainstream? Apache is free and it is the top webserver. Sendmail is free and it is the top MTA. AIM is free and it is the top Instant Messaging client. The things that are keeping linux from being mainstream are way bigger than the fact that people can download it for free and the companies producing the product aren't getting paid for that.<br /><br />I'll ask this again, why does it matter if Linux is a mainstream OS anyway? So what if Joe Sixpack down the street is using it? Yes, people should have a choice and that is what free software is about, but every OS has its place and Linux is really a server OS that can be dressed up as a desktop system. But like any imposter, it doesn't always get the job done as well as the real thing. I'm not saying that Linux doesn't serve as a good desktop, but MacOS X does a heck of a lot better job. In a lot of ways, so does Windows.<br /><br />Finally, it has been said over and over again that you aren't going to make money with a linux distribution. Money is made in the open source world by supporting those products and offering value added services. Mandrake realizes this and is working to build those up. I haven't seen any more gloom and doom emails come out about them going under, so they must be turning things around.</div>

Do you think each one of those projects gets money back? Do you think they honestly care? That isn't the spirit of free software.</div><br /><br />Since Mandrake is developped and distributed by a company of people working full time on it and depending on it as a source of income, and they do offer Mandrake for sale then yes that is leaching. If Apache was developped and distributed by a company of full time employees depending on it for income and it was available for sale, then I think people should buy it.<br /><br />The question that needs to be asked is why even bother selling something you're going to give away? Given a choice of buying a product or taking the exact same product for free, most people would take it for free. If putting food on my childrens dinner plates depends on me selling my product, whether I believe in open source or not, I'm going to try to make the money necessary to feed my children. Most &quot;Open Source&quot; project don't care because they are not relying on the product as their source of income. If they are, then they're bigger fools than Mandrake for giving away their product and allowing their families to starve.<br /><br />Open Source, IMHO, is designed around the contribution/spare time concept. ie., programmers contribute bits of code to a bigger project based on the amount of spare time they have to work on the project. Some of the programmers may work full time on the project only because they have other sources of income whether it be a full time job, a retirment check, or a spouse that's supporting them. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: Rugmonster</div><div class="quote"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: steve</div><div class="quote">I have posted to Mandrake numerous times that I think they should only put the new distro out for download after it's been on store shelves for a couple of weeks.</div><br />I'm not sure that would be completely compliant with the GPL.<br /><br />Also, unless they put some sort of copyright on the actual disk, what would stop people from purchasing the commercial version and hosting it independently?</div><br /><br />1. It's called Open &quot;Source&quot; meaning the source code is free, not necessarily the compiled code. The GPL states that you must include the source code with any compiled code you distribute/sell. You can still sell your distribution before making it available for download as long as the GPL software has the source code included. Look at SuSE. This is exactly what they do.<br /><br />2. A distribution is not inherantly free to ditriibute just because it contains GPL code. All the GPL license requires is that the source code for the GPL portion be included with the distribution. You can still write a compiled and copyrighted install program, make it a part of the distribution and not allow the free downloading or redistribution of that distribution.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">*sigh* I could go on and on about this and go circles around this. Mandrake is out to make money, but they also were founded on the ideals of free software. They continue to uphold those ideals and I think that is one of the reasons they have so much support from the community.<br /><br />Why sell something you are going to give away? Because they are selling products and services you don't get with the free distribution. The commercial product has something for some people. Other people don't need or want those additional features, so they don't pay for it. Obviously, though, there are enough people who do want those features to keep the company above water.<br /><br />Mandrake isn't hurting for money because they give away a free version of their distribution. This has been discussed before. Their money problems came from the large amount of venture capital and bad business leadership. They have been in the process of changing the track of the company and it seems to be working.<br /><br />And you're right, most open source projects don't care about money because they don't rely on the product directly for a source of income. A lot of places contribute to the project and make their money <span style="text-decoration: underline;">supporting</span> that software.<br /><br />I could care less if all of the commercial distribution makers went away tomorrow or simply stopped releasing their products for free. I have no particular love for businesses and their greed. Call me a pinko commie, but there will still be the community putting together things like Debian (http://www.debian.org). To top things off, there's nothing stopping me from making my own distribution from scratch...and letting others &quot;leech&quot; from me. By saying leech, you make it sound like we are a bunch of warez kidz who are stealing software.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don't know the pricing of the different distros, but just say they go for $99 retail. &nbsp;I'd have a really hard time buying it since a new release seems to be made every 6 months. &nbsp;<br /><br />If you pay $99 and get a pretty box, professional looking CD's, printed + bound manuals, then that's ok. &nbsp;If you pay $99 and get the same 4 cd's you could have downloaded then that wouldn't be very nice.<br /><br />I think with mandrake though, when you purchase it, you're also becomming a member of the Mandrake Club (and you can also just download the distro and pay a membership fee). &nbsp;Membership to the club gives you support for the product, and easy software updates / installations through their GUI interface. &nbsp;That's the way I understand it, is that how it works? &nbsp;<br /><br />I'm not a 100% leach, I do buy software when I have the money and think it's something I want. &nbsp;I paid for RedHat 5. &nbsp;I paid for Solaris 9. &nbsp;I own a license of WordPerfect 5.0 for Unix (used to run under Linux a long time ago, I haven't tried it lately). &nbsp;<br /><br />And sometimes I get ripped off. &nbsp;I've paid for software that ends up being not worth it. &nbsp;I've bought games I &nbsp;never play, and I've downloaded the free Enemy Territory and play it daily :)<br /><br />Oh well, just my ramblings....<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If the ads were just in the download edition that would be OK to let the so called &quot;leeches&quot; pay too but I have paid directly to Mandrake for the powerpack editions since version 7.2 and joined the Mandrake Club since it's inception. I have ordered other stuff from them also. I think I support them enough on my part not to have to endure ads. Its not so much the ads as the idea. Where will it stop? Will they add spyware or start reporting back to their partners your surfing habits. I don't have anything to hide but I don't like the trend in privicy with the computer business industry. We loose more privicy everyday in new ways so I just hate to see Mandrake get started in that direction.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you read the response Dan linked earlier, your concerns should be put to rest. Also, the ads have been in for a long time. If you think about it, a lot of companies put in ads for related products in their program installations under windows and some under linux. It isn't a big thing and usually the products are so related, you don't even realize they are ads.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">As to the ADS:<br /><br />I think that there should be ads. They should do whatever they need to do to make it. I was thinking that they should not offer the new os free untill the next one comes out. They make a great product and should reap the rewards. I also support them financial. I purchased 9.1 for no other reason then to just support them. It was sad to here that they were having money troubles. I am glad to see they are on their way to amends<br /><br />Now as to why should linux make it main stream:<br /><br />I do believe that linux is a superior operating system overall. They are just lacking the time and money to throw into research and development. I believe that Linux will in the future be able to compete. I believe that if Windows really had a true competitor on home desktops then you would see great things. I am not one of those people that dislikes Microsoft by any means. In fact, I like and use microsoft more than linux (by a 8 to 2 ratio). &nbsp;I am just a junkie for technology. I can't get enough of it. It depress me to think that I won't be able to see things from a hundred or a thousand years from now. I think what I am trying to say is remember the big picture. <br /><br />WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">IMHO, not that it matters much, I think this step by Mandrake is fine. The ads do not interfere with the running of the software, are not in violation of the GPL, do not keep track of you or what you do, and (here's the kicker) are *trivial* to remove/bypass.<br /><br />So you get some ads while the install runs. Do you *really* sit through that? I've gone through that process so many times with RH, SuSE, and Mandrake, I go grab a soda and have a smoke<span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: 1.3em;">(1)</span>.<br /><br />You are getting a great product for free. You're gonna have to tweak it anyway. So what if someone has to delete a few bookmarks and change their screensaver?<br /><br />The market (you) will decide if this continues (don't like the ads? use another distro or buy your next version of Mandrake). If I were a business, I don't think I'd buy into this anyway for the reasons above.<br /><br />And now, the kudos:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: rugmonster</div><div class="quote">I'll ask this again, why does it matter if Linux is a mainstream OS anyway?</div> Amen. It doesn't.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: and then, rugmonster</div><div class="quote">I could care less if all of the commercial distribution makers went away tomorrow or simply stopped releasing their products for free.</div> ... and hallajula. See folks, the beauty of FOSS is that <b>no one can ever take it away from you</b>. Mandrake tanks, RedHat is bought by Microsoft, and SuSE's headquarters are hit by meteors. While all of these are tragic, it matters little to your computing needs because of the GPL and folks willing to write code for the sheer joy of it.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: 1.3em;">(1) P'Cola LUG does not endorse smoking during installs or any other time.
