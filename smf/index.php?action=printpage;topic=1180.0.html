					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am using Mandrake 9.1. Most everything is working wonderfully. I have not used this as my primary computer until recently though. So the little things are starting to bother me a bit.<br /><br />Everytime I reboot I have to go back into the control panel and have it autodetect my printers. Never been a problem, takes less than 1 minute to do the task. But what is irritating is that I never remember to do it until I am just about ready to print. Then I have to redetect my printers. Shut down the program that I want to print from and then restart it so I can print.<br /><br />How do I make the printers &quot;stick.&quot; Is there a config file that it is not writing to that I can manually go in and fix?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi David, I don't have to do that each time. Mine are always there &quot;sticky&quot; as you say. I didn't have to do anything special my printers are on a print server and I use CUPS. I've never set a local printer but in my case I have had to configure CUPS (by clicking on that option in MCC) and do a refresh for it to find them but after it did and I clicked DONE everything worked. You can also do some configurating of printers in KDE control center under Preipherals &gt; Printers using Administrator Mode.</div>
