					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you've got the rig to run it, do yourself a favor and download the Unreal Tournament Linux Demo (http://www.linuxgames.com/news/index.php3/5910)! &nbsp;This is quite possibly the prettiest thing to grace your monitor since you downloaded that Britney Spears wallpaper! &nbsp;Bombing Run is awsome, and I can't wait for some of you with spare boxen (I'm fresh out, I'm afraid) to set up a dedicated server. &nbsp;8)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">How true ... if you have the power to run it, this is quite possibly the best looking game you have ever played. &nbsp;I'll still stick to my counterstrike, but the new Unreal engine will probably be powering most of the cutting edge games for the next few years.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I downloaded it yesterday. It's awesome. Of course, not being a gamer, I got slaughtered each time I went on-line.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Nothing boosts the ego like a bot match with the buggers set to &quot;Novice&quot; &nbsp;:lol: <br />If you haven't heard already, Gentoo (http://www.gentoo.org) has put out a live cd (think cd-bootable distro like Knoppix) that has the latest NVidia drivers and the UT-2k3 demo on it. &nbsp;Now you can slip this puppy into any modern machine, reboot, and get your gaming fix!<br /><br />Speaking of CS, can it run Linux native? &nbsp;I've only played once for a few hours back in my Windows days, but it was loads of fun.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I see several servers for cs running linux, so I am pretty sure there is a native linux version. &nbsp;The official website is counter-strike.net . &nbsp;I need to look into it a little more but it would be great for a LAN party, because you don't need the fastest machine to run it, even though it looks great on good cards.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Epic has shipped UT-2003 to the manufacturer and it should be in out hot little hands by month's end! &nbsp;What is so great about that, you ask? &nbsp;Well, only that its Linux natiive out of the box! &nbsp;Yup, that's right, chummers. &nbsp;You could walk out the day it arrives in your favorite software store, purchase and slap it on your Linux machine. &nbsp;Be aware that the box will not have any indication that the Linux version is in there, but its on CD 3. &nbsp;Oh, and did I mention that not only is the Linux version being released concurrently with the Windows version, but it will be *supported* just like the Windows version!<br /><br />For you non-gamers with spare rigs for dedicated servers, Epic has stated that they will soon release a *F R E E* dedicated server.<br /><br />Epic has done us Linux gamers right and in a big way, so show them and the rest of the gaming industry that its worth their time by heading over to Tux Games (http://www.tuxgames.com) and get your copy today!</div>
