					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I was in Sam's the other day and noticed they had a 120GB USB 2.0 external hard drive for $118.00. &nbsp;It was made by Simpletech (http://www.simpletech.com/simpledrive/USBexternalHD.php) . &nbsp;I was wondering if anyone had any experience with external hard drives under Linux and with this one in particular.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Since USB, USB 2.0 and Firewire are all supported, I have had success using external storage devices to include external drives and usb thumb drives. The only thing I saw that was weird was when I would unplug the storage device and plug it back in, it would come back up as if it were a new device on the scsi chain.</div>
