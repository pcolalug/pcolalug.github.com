					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Anyone here ever tried to build a LFS system? &nbsp;I've been reading some about it, and am toying with the idea of trying it. &nbsp;Just wondering if anybody has been successful with it, and if it's worth the (apparently considerable) effort required to build...<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I remember about a month or so ago, my dad mitchr tried LFS &nbsp;:lol: &nbsp;<br /><br />if i remember correctly, his comment after a week or 2 of building the LFS system was something along the lines of that it would be great if u could spare a few months/years of your life compiling lol<br /><br />i've looked at it and toyed with the idea but I don't have the time to waste on compiling even on my p4 2.8 system....i think i'll just stick to slack for now &nbsp;:wink:</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've put together a LFS system before. It was fun for the first 20 packages or so, but god it got old after that. It's good for learning what all goes into a distribution, but it is a lot of work. I wouldn't suggest it for someone wanting to get a system up quick and long term maintenance and upkeep is a pain, but good for learning or extreme tweaking.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think of Gentoo as a more streamlined/less involved LFS. That may be a good thing to try first, but you've done that, haven't you?</div>
