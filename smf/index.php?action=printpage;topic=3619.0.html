					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Around lunch today, we had our little ugly sweater party, at O&#039;zone pizza.&nbsp; It was good... the pizza that is, not the sweaters! :D<br /><br />Four people showed up, me, David #1, David #2, and our newest member, John (sontek.)&nbsp; We sat around and chewed the fat for about 3 hours, and had a good time.&nbsp; We convinced the waitress there to take a picture of us in our ugly sweater glory, perhaps as a warning to others. :D<br /><br />Ugly Sweater Image (http://hphotos-snc3.fbcdn.net/hs127.snc3/17471_221780151990_595126990_3632584_6137621_n.jpg)!<br /><br />Ian</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Outside of a documentary on Colombians who &quot;love&quot; donkeys, this meet-up was the highlight of my Christmas eve, discussing it in textual form just can&#039;t do it justice, but for those who missed out, you truly missed the most monumental event to happen on Christmas Eve &#039;09, not even the Pope could steal the glory that was Uglypalooza &#039;09 with his security breach. <br /><br />We discussed Distros (Slackware, Ubuntu, Debian, Caldera, Mandr(ake,iva), and SUSE), Media Players (Banshee, Exaile, Rhythmbox, and Amarok), Traveling (Argentina, Italy, Spain, Mexico), and followed up a discussion on backups that was started earlier this week on the forums. <br /><br />dpeach also had FSM looking over him today as he was about to get worked in what would have been one of the most legendary battles in gallaga history but alas the machine was broken, but patiences is a virtue and his day will come.<br /><br />You can tell a lot about a fellow&#039;s character by his way of eating pizza and choosing of ugly sweaters and I must say, my life will never be the same, I hope the rest of you can join us next time!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It was a good&#039;un.<br /><br />Since the meetup I have gotten the backup scripts working on my Linux boxes. I have not tried tackling rdiff-backup on Windows or Mac yet, but their time is coming. I am also currently playing some good Christopher Parkening guitar albums on Banshee. I can&#039;t say that I definitely like it overall better than Amarok, but the podcast downloading is certainly a lot easier to figure out on Banshee.<br /><br />Thanks for taking the time to get together.</div>
