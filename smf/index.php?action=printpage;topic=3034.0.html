It is being made available for developers and consumers to test their content to ensure existing content plays back correctly and that there are no compatibility issues.<br /><br />Nick<br /></div>

Even if they released a 64 bit version, I would stilll run it 32 bit for the w32codecs used by Mplayer.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I installed it, then launched Firefox 2 and it ran slow or froze and if it ran at all I couldn&#039;t select things from menus.... Click on links and nothing would happen. I put 7 back for now.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Alan, I had the same problem. I fixed it by removing any links to Flash Player 7. This was not easy as it was snooping around and finding flash player 7 in all kinds of places.<br /><br />Go to about:config in the URL bar. Then do a search for: plugin.expose_full_path&nbsp; &nbsp;Change that to true. Then go to about:plugins and see if there are any references to the Flash Player 7 (or any other version). Remove it from wherever it says it is installed and then start over with 9 and see if that helps.<br /><br />Hope so. It works fine for me now.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok, that seemed to work! I found the line &quot;plugin.expose_full_path&quot;, double click to change to true. I didn&#039;t find any links to 7.0.&nbsp; However I still can&#039;t watch video&#039;s on Fox news web site. I use to but something happened a couple months ago and they won&#039;t play now. I sent about ten emails and no answer.&nbsp; Anyway ..... thanks&nbsp; dpeach</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That probably has more to do with them being WMV or something else, not Flash. I can&#039;t watch videos on CNN. Can&#039;t get the mplayer plugin to work correctly with them. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The MXMLC ActionScript 3 compiler is wicked cool also, if you are into that sort of thing...<br /><br />Works great on Ubuntu</div>
