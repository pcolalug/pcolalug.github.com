					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello!<br /><br />Thanks to Mir for referring me here.<br /><br />I currently have a Harry Potter (http://www.harrypotterspage.com - I started it back in 2001) site that has grown considerably, and is really becoming one of the more well known sites in the HP community. &nbsp;My server is Nexcess, and I love them, but I'm growing to the point that I really need my own server - or I need to rent one locally. &nbsp;Here are my current stats (and they will grow towards to end of the month):<br /><br />62.13 GB of bandwidth<br />604.6 MB of disk space used (although this will go down as soon as I'm done converting all of my files from FP - I'm using dreamweaver now)<br />I only have three email accounts being used<br />So far this month I'm at 7689163 hits, and 60015 visits.<br /><br />Is there anyone out there that can help me out???? &nbsp;I really need to do this by next month. &nbsp;I looked into having my own server, but was told by a friend that Mediacom will charge me $100/mo (I haven't confirmed this and will soon) for having a server.<br /><br />Any ideas? &nbsp;Thanks in advance!!!! :D <br /><br />P.S. &nbsp;I absolutely LOVE the Quidditch skin!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You have several options depending on your budget. You may want to drop by the Lug's sponsor &nbsp;(shameless plug) &nbsp;http://www.hitechwizard.net which will give you an idea of what's available locally. I also have rack space in Austin that's connected via OC3, which I can quote for you if you are interested.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'd get it from hitechwizard.net, they most likely have better pricing than Plugit. Another place cheaper than plugit: http://mallexpro.com/</div>
