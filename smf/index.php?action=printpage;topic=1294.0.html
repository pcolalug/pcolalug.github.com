					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello all!<br /><br />Just wanted to say that our presenter, Keith Murphy, did an excellent job.<br />Overall presentation was great, handouts were also informative, and it gave me a great overall review.<br /><br />If this meeting was indicative of the quality of the LUG meetups, I'll be looking forward to February!<br /><br />:)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">When I heard about the presentation this week, I wished more than normal I was in NWFL. Sounds like it was a good meeting. Hopefully, I'll be able to make a meeting in April since that should be the next time I'm home.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It was a great meeting. Thanks for the space Mitch and Co.<br /><br />Wow! 26 people in attendance was the number I heard. That is a record!<br /><br />Had good discussion about the library (http://www.pcolalug.org/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=30). &nbsp;It is a great resource for sharing and borrowing books. If you have some books that others might be able to use, post them there. Also you can borrow books from other members. The LUG has a pile of books that travel to the meetings each month. There are some rules for all of this. Visit the library section (http://www.pcolalug.org/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=30) to get more info.<br /><br />The discussion on security was helpful. I felt awkward sitting at the front of the room. Every time he mentioned a boneheaded thing that people do with security, I could feel all of you staring down the bald spot on the back of my head.<br /><br />Keith, could you post your notes here, or give us a link to the notes so that we can have those resources available?<br /><br />Good to see everyone.</div>
