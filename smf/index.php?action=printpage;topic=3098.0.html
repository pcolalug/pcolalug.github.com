					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I got my grubby little hands on a copy of Vista and installed it this morning. Underwhelmed sums it up. Yes, it has some pretty little added animations, translucent window borders and a few other things, but for the most part, I haven&#039;t found anything making it worth the upgrade from XP. I was constantly nagged about running this application or installing another application. When I need to do something such as add a user or make a minor change, I would be asked if I wanted to do that. Conversely, IE7 prompted me to install add-ons, but wouldn&#039;t tell me what it was wanting to install. The settings are spread out far and wide, so finding network settings requires a trip through multiple windows. That is pretty much the case for most everything. Application compatibility is another thing that got me. I install Azureus, but when I ran it, I got a missing dll error followed by a notice that it wasn&#039;t allowed to access something in the JRE. Oddly enough, Eclipse ran fine. I was able to get release level drivers from Nvidia, but Creative only has beta drivers for the Audigy ZS line.<br /><br />All in all, it really left me with a feeling of disappointment and relief. Through their over complication of doing most anything useful with your system, constant nagging and less that impressive UI, I am relieved that the linux community may grow even more with desktop users. There is so much more impressive things coming out of the OSS community that I&#039;m comfortable to say we&#039;re already ahead of MS in the OS/UI arena. The current Linux kernel, Xorg/AIGLX, Xgl, Beryl/Compiz, Gnome/KDE already provide all that Vista has to offer and more.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just out of curiousity, do you know how similar the copy of Vista that you installed is to the version that is released this spring? I tried a beta version a while back, and it really sucked-- I could not tell if it was due to my hardware, a buggy beta release, or general MS crappiness.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I got build 6000, which is the Release To Manufacturer build, so it is the final minus packaging.<br /><br />On a side note, speed was decent, though when I was typing in Word 2007 (got that too), the letters were somewhat delayed. Here&#039;s my system&#039;s specs.<br /><br />Athlon64 3200+<br />1GB Memory<br />Nvidia Geforce 7800GS 256MB AGP<br />7200RPM 16MB Seagate ATA100 drive<br /><br />Another side note, I hate the new Start menu. Rather than the All Programs opening to a large menu, it is within the area in XP that was the recently used programs. I&#039;m not a fan of clicking the mouse any more than I have to and Vista has taken it to the extreme.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I wonder how many suckers will believe that Vista is innovative and/ or secure. My experience with Vista is that it rips off Apple OS X, KDE, and Gnome, then lays it on top of Windows XP. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">We&#039;ve been using a copy of Vista beta 2 (or recently 3?) for quite a few months now at work.<br /><br />Underwhelmed is an understatement.&nbsp; I&#039;ve yet to see any real benefit from using vista.&nbsp; My biggest complaint is the ram usage of vista.&nbsp; We have it trimmed down, but it still uses 350-400 meg of 512 ram on the system.&nbsp; This leads to &quot;vista bugs&quot; in the software we test, where our code crashes simply from the lack of ram on the system (yes, our code is in java&nbsp; ^-^)<br /><br />IMO each release of an OS should not be significantly more bloated than the last.&nbsp; However, with windows this seems to be the case.&nbsp; Windows 2000 and XP required about 128 and 256mb of ram respectively to run decently on a system.&nbsp; Vista on the other hand seems to require 800 to a gig to be usable.&nbsp; Given that I&#039;ve seen no *real* usability improvement since 2000 (with the exception of wireless drivers in XP), how in the world can they justify this?&nbsp; I currently have windows server 2003 nestled on a small partition on my old hard drive.&nbsp; The last time I checked, it used 128mb of the 512 I had on the system.&nbsp; This is proof that microsoft *can* produce a system that is both functional and light weight, but they choose not to.&nbsp; It seems they are in collusion with the hardware industry to boost sales of new computers.&nbsp; Of course, given the fact that a computer from 8 years ago can still happily chug away checking email, and writing documents, I can see where the hardware vendors would be concerned.<br /><br />OTOH, I have a linux / fluxbox install on my parents machine.&nbsp; Ram usage?&nbsp; A whopping 30mb&nbsp; :D.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Oh, of course Windows Vista is bloated to hell.&nbsp; Microsoft sells most of their OS&#039;s preloaded.&nbsp; And the only way to do that is to move computers out of the door.&nbsp; If you made it so you could simply upgrade users might research first.&nbsp; If you thrust them into the current PC monoculture that you can find at any Best Buy or Wal*Mart (really now, what happened to the Preloaded Lindows boxen?) they won&#039;t consider the OS because <br />a) no choice is presented to them. and <br />b) they&#039;re too busy making sure the salesperson doesn&#039;t screw them/trying to find the best deal on the hardware.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">After playing with Vista a little more, it is starting to grow on me, at least in comparison to Windows XP. The funny thing is that I installed it on my tablet PC, and the computer died, so I was forced to install it onto my Apple MacBook. Vista runs like a champ on the MacBook, but it ran like crap on the tablet PC. <br /><br />The key is to disable the User Account Control (it does nothing anyway other than say, &quot;You are about to render your laptop un-bootable. Confirm or Deny?&quot;). <br /><br />I would not run out and buy Vista, nor would I toss out those XP disks. However, if you happen to buy a new computer, Vista is tolerable. </div>
