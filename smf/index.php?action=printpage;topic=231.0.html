					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Grab em here (http://www.nvidia.com/view.asp?IO=freebsd_1.0-3203). Be advised, they are still beta, so UAYOR. Now imnes can put FreeBSD back on his GeForce boxen!<br /><br />On that note, anyone interested in adding a *BSD forum to the distributions section?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">In the words of... some other generation: r0x0r! &nbsp;:lol: <br /><br />But it's still pretty safe to say that the various *BSD's around are lacking in cutting-edge hardware support.<br /><br /><br />As for adding the forum, I don't see any reason why not to add it. &nbsp;Even though the *BSD-based OS's are descended from quite a different lineage, I think it'd be sort of an elitist attitude by saying, &quot;No way, it's BSD, not Linux!&quot; or something similar.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I was wondering how long it would be until someone posted this. I saw it this morning and was going to post it but figured I'd wait.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I vote yes for the BSD forum!<br /><br />I'll install BSD later tonight and give this driver a try. &nbsp;Hopefully it works out good. &nbsp;I'll let you know.<br /><br />imnes</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Since 30% of all posts in the &quot;Other Distributions&quot; forum has &quot;BSD&quot; in the title, I think that would be a great idea.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You know, it might not be a bad idea to have an &quot;Other OS's&quot; section with BSD, OSX (I know, its a BSD, but I think it should have its own catagory), and &lt;gasp /&gt; Windows. I mean, while we certainly should focus on promoting &quot;alternative&quot; software and technology, many of our members also use these other environments as well. It would be nice to be a community resource for technology enthusiasts of all stripes. Just my .0175 euros.</div>
