					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thought that this (http://www.csua.berkeley.edu/~emin/source_code/dibs/) was a *really* neat idea. Let me know if you want to try it out. I've got a few gigs to spare folks.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That is an excellent idea. I did not read too deep into it, but I am sure you could do that within the LAN as well. I know this would not be as good for a localized disaster, but it would be immediate help for hard drive failure inside the network if the internet is not available.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">What does this do that rsync doesn't? &nbsp;I use rsync all the time to do backups to 3 different sites around the country, and I've never had a problem with it. &nbsp;I'm not sure what dibs will do that rsync won't.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Doesn't rsync have some security issues? I don't know, erc, as I've never used rsync save through portage in Gentoo. Does rsync compress and encrypt the data? I haven't perused the code for dibs yet.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Don't know if it has security issues, but it does have an option to tunnel everything through ssh, so you get encryption and compression.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Right. &nbsp;You could use PGP to encrypt the backups before you sent them. &nbsp;It would also be pretty easy to feed the output of tar to pgp, then to netcat...</div>
