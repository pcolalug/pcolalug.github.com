					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I know some people have asked how to get started in the industry and this is how you do it. This sounds like a great opportunity for someone who doesn&#039;t know a whole lot, but needs to get their feet wet. You have to get started some where and this would be the place to do it.</div>
