					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I believe when I first came to know the LUG, I was using Debian as a console only router on a AMD K6-200. I just threw that old box in the dumpster, yet a piece of that old system came back to life for me. If you've read my recent posts regarding x86_64 support in Linux, you know that I've struggled with it and kept coming back to SuSE 9.3. In my need for new software, I attempted upgrading to SuSE 10.0 Beta2 and then Beta3. Out of utter frustration and longing for the most wonderful package management tool ever, I decided to try Debian again.<br /><br />I downloaded the NetInstall disc because it's small, downloads and burns quickly. I was surprised to see that the installer was the exact same one Ubuntu uses. It did the same great hardware auto-detection, network setup and apt source setup. Holy crap it was ncurses-text-based-user-interface heaven. About an hour later, I had X running Debian Stable...whatever that is called these days.<br /><br />Well, stable is stale. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. I think they're on Gnome 2.6 and OpenOffice.org 1.1.3. I'm sure things are stable, but good lord that was old. With a simple change of stable to sid in my /etc/apt/sources.list and an apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get dist-upgrade, I had a whole new, up to date system. I am running 2.6.12, Gnome 2.8 (which I can't tell is any different from 2.10), Firefox 1.0.6, Gaim 1.50, OO.o pre-2.0 and a whole slew of up to date software. <br /><br />Funny thing is, even though sid is the unstable distribution, standing for Still In Development, the system is great. The system <i>feels</i> more responsive and I've been able to cut out all of the KDE stuff I don't use. Memory utilization is lower than it was in SuSE. It all makes for a great desktop experience. I love it.<br /><br />So next time you're getting adventurous and want to try a new distro, give Debian a go. It isn't anything like it was just a year or two ago.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just wanted to make a small correction. Gnome 2.10 is installed. The help said 2.8, but when I checked the properties for the panel, it said 2.10.2 and Nautilus says 2.10.1. <br /><br />Good luck, Dan! One thing I will note, I did have to install alsa, but once that was in, I had sound and everything. Also, here is a complete listing of my apt sources.<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"><br /># /etc/apt/sources.list<br />#<br /># Main Debian repositories for SID<br />deb ftp&#58;//ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ unstable main contrib non-free<br />deb-src http&#58;//ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ unstable main contrib non-free<br />deb ftp&#58;//ftp2.de.debian.org/debian/ unstable main contrib non-free<br />deb-src http&#58;//ftp2.de.debian.org/debian/ unstable main contrib non-free<br /><br /># Extra Repository for mplayer and w32codecs<br />deb ftp&#58;//ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/ sid main<br /><br /># Experimental Debian repositories for OpenOffice.org2<br />deb http&#58;//ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ ../project/experimental main<br />deb-src http&#58;//ftp.us.debian.org/debian ../project/experimental main<br /></div><br />Since OO.o2 is in the experimental repository, you have to tell apt to look there.<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"><br /># apt-get -t experimental install openoffice.org2<br /></div></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">After using debian on / off for a while and hanging out in some debian IRC channels, I think their use of the word Stable isn't what everyone else uses. &nbsp;Most people hear stable and think &quot;Software that doesn't crash&quot;, I think Debian's use of Stable might mean &quot;Programming / Library API's don't change&quot;, and that's why debian 'stable' was on gtk 1.4 and gnome 1 for so long, because moving to gtk2 and gnome 2.x meant an API change. &nbsp;Making debian 'stable' as in it doesn't change dramatically and break precompiled software every few months.<br /><br />Maybe I'm completely wrong though :)<br /><br />I don't know what the current status of Debian is, but I know Ubuntu is going through a lot of changes, moving everything to be compiled on GCC 4 compilers, getting rid of some of the extraneous directories (I think stuff from /usr/X11, and /usr/X11R6, and others are now just being integrated into /usr). &nbsp;I don't think they would have forked from debian so maybe this is changes incoming from debian testing.<br /><br />Nick</div>
