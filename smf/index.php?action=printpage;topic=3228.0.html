					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey everyone, hope you are all doing well.&nbsp; I use to host your meetings at All Pro Sound.&nbsp; (Chris)&nbsp; Sorry I was not able to hosting them anymore...&nbsp; I really enjoyed your meetings and LAN party&#039;s&nbsp; I bet you miss the popcorn huh???<br /><br />Anyway, I need someone who knows Unix and who can help me out.&nbsp; We have 2 Unix servers running SCO, our main server for point of sale and our backup which we like to keep offsite.&nbsp; We have a older hard drive with some history that got deleted on our current drives that we used in our backup server that we moved onsite to allow our inventory manager to be able to search through the history.&nbsp; Long story short, we need to get our backup server back offsite in case of a major problem (fire, theft etc)<br /><br />Here is the task and what I need:<br /><br />I bought a used machine with close to the same specs off of e-bay (very close....&nbsp; same SCSI card, same processor speed (almost, the one I bought is 667 and ours are 600).&nbsp; I put a mirrored hard drive from our Unix system in it and it loads fine until it tries to load the PERC driver once SCO loads and then it fails.&nbsp; The server is a Dell 2400 and it&#039;s all SCSI based.&nbsp; My goal is to be able to get the one hard drive we have with all the history to load and run.&nbsp; We can do test based on new mirrors without a problem before we try it on the real deal so there is room for error here.<br /><br />I would also like to see about loading a plug in for our backup solution onto our Unix system.&nbsp; Using Veritos...<br /><br />We are working to move to SAP on a SQL platform at the first of 2008 but the performance of the intergraters is not promising so we may be longer.&nbsp; I need to make sure we cross our T&#039;s and dot our i&#039;s until then and can provide our warehouse managers with a solution to review history and also to be able to backup our current system until we move platforms (which I am still uneasy about).<br /><br />If you are interested, contact me at chris@allprosound.com.&nbsp; You don&#039;t need to be a company or anything like that!&nbsp; A person who I feel is capable to do the job after talking with them will flip the bill and we will pay for your services.&nbsp; I&#039;m not asking for any handouts here...<br /><br />Thanks and I look forward to hearing from any of you who are interested in helping up out.<br /><br />Chris Couture<br />All Pro Sound<br />chris@allprosound.com</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have a quick question. Does the server that you bought have hotswap drives? Why not just back up the data and then reconfig? <br /><br />Josh</div>
