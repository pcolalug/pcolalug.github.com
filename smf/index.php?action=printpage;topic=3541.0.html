					Title: <b>Creating strong passwords</b><br />

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I know many of you probably already have a formula for creating strong passwords, but here is one I learned a few years ago. I am going to teach this method to a group of people next week who are not necessarily computer savvy. I think this is a good, simplistic way to create unique passwords that are also relatively strong.<br /><br />Particularly I use this on websites. This is not exactly the way I do mine, but here is the basic concept. We are going to create a 10 character password with this. You can make it longer, but I would not make it shorter. The shortest password you should have would be 8 characters for on-line stuff.<br /><br /><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><li>Take the first 5 letters in the website. Let&#039;s use Facebook.com as an example. faceb</li><li>Now take a 5 letter word that you will always use to do this. water</li><li>Upper case and munge the special word. W4T3R</li><li>Now start with the website name and put the 2 words together like so: fWa4cTe3bR</li></ul><br />Now you have a unique password for that site that if someone hacks will not necessarily give them access to everything else in your life like they would have if you used the same password everywhere. You don&#039;t really have to remember the password since you can re-create it every time. If a site has fewer than 5 letters in its name you can add what comes after the &quot;.&quot;. For example, if a site were dog.net you could do your hash with dogne.<br /><br />This is just the basics. You can build from this to make other seemingly random passwords for different security levels. If you are creating a password for a program instead of a website you can use the name of the program in your hash.<br /><br />Do you have any other suggestions for creating unique passwords?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I like it, the only thing that I might suggest is adding punctuation/special characters to give your password that little extra bit. &nbsp;For example, you could munge the letter S in to $.&nbsp; Also, the second word you&#039;re combining in there doesn&#039;t really need to be a word, just some random chars you always end up using with the same password scheme. :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think thats a very good and easy way to make a strong password, because as long as you can remember how you created it, it would be possible to figure it out again. The method is very similar to how they have taught me to do it in a lot classes, because it is something difficult to figure out, but can be traced back to find out.<br /><br />As also mentioned, I do think using special characters to replace some of the letters is a good idea.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Good point about the second word not needing to be a real word. Obviously mine is not when you start putting numbers in there. But it could easily be a seemingly random string of characters as long as you could always replicate it.<br /><br />Any punctuation or symbols would make it stronger.</div>
