					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I know that the world is not entirely Linux and to that end we get sometimes stuck using NTFS for partitioning. Recently I had a problem that I wanted to keep my XP (for reasons known only to me) and partition part of it for linux, But how to do this . Here is the How! <br />http://www.sysresccd.org/<br />With this single disk Distro you can easily move delete and resize NTFS partitiond to you are blue in the face. fault free.<br />It gives you a very nice gui everybit as good as partitionMagic.<br />I had my 60gig partitioned in about 2 minutes and on my way to Linux Bliss.<br />Brett<br /><br />Hope this helps you out.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Playing with it now. I will give some observations as I go along.<br /><br />First thing I noticed that pleased me was that in the boot process you can chose your keyboard layout. Dvorak was one of them. Very nice. For those who don't know, there are many more keyboard layouts than what the typical US American realizes. Even languages that have all the same characters as ours will have a different layout.<br /><br />Secondly is that it is Gentoo. I have yet to make a final decision as to whether that is a good thing or a bad thing at the moment. 8) <br /><br />I got in there and did not see what I was looking for right off (neither did I read any documentation.) I was looking to see if it had a utility to detect and block off bad sectors. Did not see it immediately. But did play with the Partition Magic clone (even calls itself that in the CD.) Seemed easy enough to use. I was not resizing nor partitioning anything, just curious. So I went ahead and formatted the drive just for jollies. Worked fine I reckon.<br /><br />Not finding what I was initially looking for without having to do that dreaded reading thing, I just reformatted the drive and got out to start installing Mandrake 10.1 to see how it goes.<br /><br />This is on my notebook I have not been able to get any OS loaded on there (5 or 6 Linux attempts and 3 different versions of Windows attempted on it.) If this does not work, then I am going to decide that the problem may be the CD drive. I replaced this a couple of years ago. It seems that it needs to be replaced again. :(</div>
