					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Am taking the advice to introduce myself and step right up and ask for some help. &nbsp;<br />I have a home built computer. &nbsp;An Asus A7N266-E motherboard, &nbsp;AMD Athlon 1.8GHz processor. &nbsp;<br />I have a dual boot system, Windows XP and Mandrake 10. &nbsp;I am the user on a cable modem network. &nbsp;A Netgear MR814 router connected to the cable modem and a Netgear MA 111 wireless USB adapter connected to my computer.<br /><br />I've tried reading many posts at LinuxQuestions.org about how to download and install a driver for my MA111..........but it is so overwhelming to me, and I have not yet been able to understand the process. &nbsp;<br /><br />I'm not totally new to downloading and installing software for Linux.......as I have used RPMs in the past; &nbsp;but configuring a kernel and all the other steps is more than I can process with such little experience.<br /><br />Thanks in advance for any assistance I find through this post.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It seems that there are two versions of that adapter, and which one you have makes a big difference... &nbsp;<br /><br />Check this link and see if it helps any, let us know:<br />http://www.qbik.ch/usb/devices/showdev.php?id=2911<br /><br />Another option if you can do it, would be to just go out and get a wireless card that you know is well supported in Linux...<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">and wouldn't you just know it.......... &nbsp;I have the version 2 model.<br /><br />I have only about 4 or 5 more weeks at my present location wherein I am forced to continue using a wireless. &nbsp;After that I will be directly connected to a cable modem........which brings up the question of compatability between it and Linux. &nbsp; I will be using Knology cable internet service.......anybody out there with any experience using their equipment?<br /><br />Thanks</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">In general, cable Internet should work on any Linux platform with no problems. DSL, on the other hand, can get tricky due to PPoE. You should have no problems getting any cable Internet working, once you have the wireless up and running.<br /><br />Cable Internet is straightforward--just plug the ethernet cable into your ethernet card and go. <br /><br />If you can not get wireless working, you can try ndiswrapper. The catch is that you will need to use the command line.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">sounds good. &nbsp;Thanks.<br /><br />Now to a different forum for a couple of questions about different subject matter.<br /><br />I'm really enjoying this website already. &nbsp; I've got a couple of books about learning Linux, &nbsp;but sometimes it's helpful to have someone explain it....and give more specific information.</div>

Set up the router (another piece of hardware that is an incredibly helpful device), and you can work with cable or DSL equally as easy.<br /><br />I bought a router for $20 about 6 months ago. Keep your eye open in the sale papers and you are bound to find one in your price range.</div>
