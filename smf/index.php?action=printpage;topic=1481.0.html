					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I made a copy of Lindows tonight and installed it onto my desktop when I got home. &nbsp;This is my first real experience with debian and I gotta say it's actually really good. &nbsp;The downside of lindows is no dev tools installed, the up side is apt-get. &nbsp;So I quickly got all my usual tools in place. &nbsp;<br /><br />This might definitely be an os for the family to use, I can get to a console and use apt-get to quickly install things, and the tweaked kde is setup very easy to use.<br /><br />Even though according to their website intel i810 audio is supported, it's not working in their kernel. &nbsp;I grabbed the latest 2.4 and 2.6 kernels, and everything works well now.<br /><br />The Click-N-Run software repository looks like a good idea, but I'm not ready to fork over a subscription fee yet, I think I can get everything I want installed the old-fashioned way. &nbsp;But if I were a new user I wouldn't mind paying to avoid any hassles.<br /><br />We'll see if things hold up after a few days of usage. &nbsp;Once I found out all the needed apps / games work here I'll work on converting the family's XP installs over.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I finally have it installed and am really impressed. It is definately not for the SysAdmin, but it does have some really cool features.<br /><br />The greatest of it's features is it's simplicity. Again, not for the Geek, but maybe for the Geek's grandmother. IM works. What client does it use? I have no idea, and don't need to. It just works. What web browser/email client? Don't know, don't care. (Ok, so I do know and do care, but for those to whom Lindows is targeted, it doesn't matter).<br /><br />All my hardware is detected. Even my on board LAN, which required a special kernel hack for Mandrake 9.2, works.<br /><br />The down side is that it runs as root. I have seen this argued both directions. My grandmother would not care what a root is. She would simply want to use IM, email, and browse the Internet. She is not doing much by way of theming and printer set up. So, she would not need root privileges generally. But why make her learn new passwords and login names just to change the screen resolution?<br /><br />I personally care that my system tasks are divided between root and my user, but I can see where, for many people, it would not matter.<br /><br />I won't use Lindows long term, but I think it is a good distro for what it claims to do. It is simple and works. I would assume that if you install software from the Click-N-Run warehouse, it would work just as well. Kind of a boring distro. It all works as advertised. I admit that I have not played with it much, but from one day's worth of use, it is acceptable.</div>
