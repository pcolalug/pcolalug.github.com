					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><b>Book Review</b><br />By: Dan C<br /><br /><b>Linux Network Administrator's Guide, 2nd Edition</b><br />Written by: Olaf Kirch & Terry Dawson<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I read this book to improve my knowledge of Linux networking, and in that regard it was a huge success! &nbsp;It was also an enjoyable and easy-to-read book. &nbsp;I am pretty much a Linux beginner, and know enough to &quot;be dangerous&quot;. &nbsp;This book cleared up many questions I had, enabling my home network to run more efficiently and securely. &nbsp;I found the information to be detailed enough so that I got what I needed, but not so overwhelming as to turn off my interest level.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The book covers some history of networking, and explains the TCP/IP protocol in great detail. &nbsp;Issues covered include IP addressing/subnetting, name resolution, routing, kernel considerations, and drivers. &nbsp;The next several chapters discuss how to configure many kinds of networking hardware and software, such as ethernet, serial/SLIP/PPP, and NIS/NFS. &nbsp;There were great examples of the configuration files that require editing, with understandable explanations of why you were doing it. &nbsp;A make-believe small business is used as an example throughout the book, as they build and expand their corporate network and integrate with other branches of the company.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The next section covered how to set up a firewall/router, again with great example configuration files and scripts. &nbsp;This part went into just the right amount of detail, and included discussion on packet filtering, firewall testing, IP packet accounting, and NAT/masquerading. &nbsp;I'd say I got the most amount of useful knowledge from this section, and will refer to it many times again when I get around to building a router for the home LAN.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;There are several chapters dedicated to setting up and understanding various network services that you may with to install and administer. &nbsp;These include email server/client, UUCP/Usenet news, NNTP and INN, and DNS. &nbsp;There are excellent diagrams, tables, and examples throughout the book.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Overall I was very pleased with the book, and would recommend it to anyone interested in Linux networking. &nbsp;It has something for everyone, at all skill levels. &nbsp;The table of contents and index are excellent, and you can find exactly what you're looking for very quickly. &nbsp;Well done to the authors, and to O'Reilly Publishing!<br /><br /><br />P.S. - this review also submitted to Slashdot and O'Reilly</div>
