					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey all.<br /><br />Some of you might remember back when kde 3.5 was supposedly comming out, there was a buzz about a lean build of kde called kde light.<br />Now, a window manager with most of the functionality of kde, but one that is nice and lightwieght like fluxbox or xfce would be a welcome addition to linux, but I can&#039;t seem to *find* it anywhere.<br /><br />Did find some screens here:<br />http://shots.osdir.com/slideshows/slideshow.php?release=425&amp;slide=10<br /><br />Let me know if you find anything<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Actually, that links to pocketlinux, a minimalist slackware distro.<br /><br />It&#039;s ok though I found out that kde light is nothing more than a few standard wm components, pakaged together and renamed.&nbsp; I&#039;m really rather disappointed.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I can load up kde apps in fluxbox, and while it will be marginally faster, it still has to load up all the same old kde libs that are the foundation of kde.&nbsp; I thought kde light was gona be a rewrite of the desktop env and these underlying libs.&nbsp; I see no real benifit here, as if your gona run kde apps, you mine as well load up kde since the majority of the system resources are gona be used anyway.<br /><br />That&#039;s why I love finding applications that can be compiled independently of gnome or kde.&nbsp; What they lack in functionality (often little) they more than make up for it in overall speed and snappyness.&nbsp; Although, since I no longer really game in linux (fie on those AA devs! fie!) I am more open to gnome and kde</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just compile all of the KDE apps statically. No shared libs to worry about then.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Wouldn&#039;t that be worse?&nbsp; Then you&#039;d have the additional load-time and memory requirements of a new copy of all those libs every time you launched a KDE app.&nbsp; (At least I think).<br /><br />Nick<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The load time should be better, I believe. No library loading. The executable would take up more space, since it has the library code included, but not large enough that anyone with a fairly recent system would mind. I think RAM usage would be higher, but I am not sure by how much. Probably not enough that anyone would notice. The main advantage to the shared library is only having to update one library when the library is changed because of a vulnerability or new functionality, instead of tracking down every application that uses it and recompiling or downloading a new binary. <br /><br />I don&#039;t remember everything completely and didn&#039;t feel like breaking out my OS book, but that should be close enough, I think.</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think the memory utilization would completely depend on the library being used. But you are right on the fact that it would be a pain with maintaining currency on the libs. If you have a lot of statically compiled programs and have a severe vulnerability in one of those libs, you would have a lot of recompiling to do. Yuck.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just caught an article (http://osnews.com/story.php?news_id=13857) at osnews.com about SimpleKDE (http://www.simplekde.org/). I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ve checked it out. Seems like their goal is to cut some of the fluff out and optimize the code. <br /><br />Here&#039;s the quick and dirty of their goal.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">SimpleKDE aims to join...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * The strength and user-friendliness of KDE<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * The simplicity and usability of Gnome<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * The responsiveness of Xfce<br /></div><br />Sounds interesting. The screenshots looked nice. (http://www.simplekde.org/node/6) Cleaner than your typical KDE install, that&#039;s for sure. Not sure if I like them taking away the pager and it looks very Windows-ish, but clean.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve been using a customized version of xfce lately.&nbsp; All the gtk theme goodness in a lightweight package, and a decent toolbar (fbpane)<br />check it out<br />http://img484.imageshack.us/my.php?image=mydesktop4vn.jpg</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Woo...that&#039;s pretty. I like it. I felt sort of limited with XFCE, but I never dove into the configuration files. I made that judgement off of what options are available in the configuration GUIs.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Not only that, but check out the memory usage! 49mb baseline isn&#039;t bad at *all*. (eat your heart out dan :D)<br /><br />That leaves plenty of ram for memory hungry applications like compiling, vid editing, and gaming etc.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Getting a little off topic, but I like to make profiles for my games so that when I log in from GDM, it just starts up the game with no window manager or other desktop environment items. When you&#039;re running a full screen game, no reason having that other stuff running.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Most systems with over 512MB of memory run as desktops really don&#039;t need swap. I have it just in case, but tend to run with a swappiness of 1.<br /><br />Info on setting swappiness and the debate over it. (http://kerneltrap.org/node/3000)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just a note, I&#039;ve been trying to get somewhat current package of kde for slackware.&nbsp; I installed it, lo and behold, It can&#039;t find libstdc++.<br /><br />Now, that&#039;s installed with gcc so I know i have it.&nbsp; I to a quick slocate and find libstdc++.so.5 whereas KDE wants .6.&nbsp; Guess what that means folks?&nbsp; They compiled this for slackware *current* and not&nbsp; 10.2 as advertised.&nbsp; That&#039;s really frickn lame, I am not about to futz with installing a new gcc and borking my whole system in the process.&nbsp; I get so mad at ppl who pull this crap when they submit packages.&nbsp; If you can&#039;t compile it for stock 10.2 at LEAST note it in the discription.&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;:(<br /><br />Now I have a choice between downloading the entire src for kde and compiling it myself, using old 3.4.2 packages, or trying to do QT development in gnome without all the extra helper code that makes kde easy to work with.</div>
