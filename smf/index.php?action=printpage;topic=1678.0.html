					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Been doing some reading about Libranet, a desktop GNU/Linux distribution based on Debian. &nbsp;I've tried and failed to install older versions of Debian but supposedly Libranet has an idiot-restant installation.<br /><br />If any of you have any experience with it please let me know what you think. &nbsp;<br /><br />Chuck<br />http://www.pcola.com/sandspur/</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I tried Libranet a couple of years ago. &nbsp;The installer is text based and the desk top is a version or two behind mandrake and the others. &nbsp;I had problems with getting nic-cards and PCMCIA card to work so I didn't play with it long. <br />Good luck and let us know how it goes.<br /><br />Jdennis</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Linspire is Debian Sarge idiot-proofed. &nbsp;It's a little behind version wise too, KDE 3.0 and Kernel 2.4.25. &nbsp;New release should be out this month which bumps up to current KDE and 2.6 series kernel.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Gotta plug Linspire. May not be the most secure distro out there, but most of the folks I've talked to who have actually used it think its great. My parents recently got broadband, but their old WinME rig is getting long in the tooth and I was contemplating moving them to Linspire.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I loaded libranet 2.7 on a p233MMx machine last week and the install went very smoothly however I don't have a sound card so I don't know if there would be any problems there. I thought I had a problem hooking up to the net through my lan, and I voiced my problem at the June meeting. The problem turned out to be my lack of following through with the install. When I turned the machine on on Sunday morning, everything was working as it should. I was able to surf the net as well as SSH to my other computers on the lan. I doubt if I will stay with Libranet very long as I still want to try some other distros on this old machine. 96 meg RAM and 1.2 Gig hard drive. Tonight I am downloading Gentoo and maybe I will try it this week sometime.<br /><br />Harold</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Harold,<br /><br />Glad to hear you got Libranet going with the internet.<br /><br />On a machine like that, you may want to give Vector Linux a try. &nbsp;It's small and based on Slackware.<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">At 224 MB I may give it a try. Thanks for the suggestion Dan. I will let you know if and when I do try it. Right now I have house guest and computer time is limited to when they go to bed and I get some free time.----------------Harold :wink:</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Harold,<br /><br />A followup - I was bored, so installed Vector Linux 4.0 on a test machine. &nbsp;For a 224Mb ISO, it's very nice. &nbsp;Some apps are a little dated, and it uses kernel 2.4.22, but works great. &nbsp;The install is easy, and similar to Slackware. &nbsp;If you want to use X, it comes with Xfce, Fluxbox, and IceWM window managers only. &nbsp;I had forgotten how wickedly fast these WM's are (as compared to Gnome/KDE). &nbsp;Truly amazing. &nbsp;I think this one's gonna keep a spot on the test machine for a while. &nbsp;For an older machine with limited horsepower, I think this distro would be hard to beat. &nbsp;Give it a look!<br /><br />Dan</div>
