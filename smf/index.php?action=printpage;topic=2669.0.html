					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Wow, big night on the internet it seemed..... Was browsing around, talking on irc/aim and so on, and all of a sudden things starting taking a dive. it&#039;s bad when google, slashdot, etc aren&#039;t reachable and you&#039;ve tested your end and things are halting at the backbone..... in this case, level3.<br /><br />catching bits and peices of what&#039;s being said on freenode in the newly created ##level3 channel, level3 took almost a complete dump.<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">&lt;xbmodder_lappy&gt; The services that are known to be dead are Verio, Sprint Link, SoCal TimeWarner Road Runner, PBI (ouch), NAS Router, Level3, AboveNet, APNIC, and ANS.<br /></div><br />I&#039;m attaching 2 screenshots from internet health monitors if anyone is curious to check out.<br /><br />kinda crazy though, I joined up the ##level3 channel in freenode and there was around 100 people in there including myself, in less than 30seconds there were 175 people in there.... and now less than 20minutes after joining the channel, it&#039;s over 370 people in there<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">&lt;deblin&gt; saw this from someone on my ISP&#039;s web forum: Level(3) had an OSPF failure in Chicago, that is resulting in nationwide failures across the US and parts of Europe. They are currently working on restoring service in all markets</div></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">hm, weird..... this partly has to do with how permissions were carried over from phpBB. with features that phpBB had disabled, it carried over as default. See if you can view now. everyone has permissions for viewing and so on with attachments, but double checked permissions and added one thing to grouped members.... <br /><br />also, ran across this:<br />http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/68751</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Bhoff, you should be able to now. Being a global moderator, you had a different set of permissions from everyone else. O0<br /><br />I just wanted to use the &#039;fro because it&#039;s there.</div>
