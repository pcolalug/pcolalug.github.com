					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Been wrestling with getting BellSouth DSL service going. &nbsp;BellSouth offers NO Linux support. &nbsp;<br />Configuring the ethernet card and the DSL modem was straightforeward enough using RH9 GUIs.<br /><br />Read in some RH documentation not to set a host name when using DHCP and I took their advice. &nbsp;Don't know why that is important.<br /><br />The problem rested with dealing with BellSouth's login proceedures. &nbsp;Luckily my girlfriend's Windows XP computer was temporarily at my place. &nbsp;I connected the DSL modem to it and installed BellSouth's software. &nbsp;Rebooted and then doubleclicked on the MSIE icon and darned of a graphical login GUI did not appear.<br /><br />I wrote down the URL for the login page and on my Linux box I made that URL the start page for Mozilla. &nbsp;Without using the Windows box I'd have never guessed to do that.<br /><br />If any of you try BellSouth DSL service rember to make the following URL your start page in your browser: &nbsp;http://hometab.bellsouth.net.<br /><br />Anyway, after living with connect speeds like 26.4 with a 56.6 modem out here on Pensacola Beach with a dialup account &nbsp;the DSL is wonderful.<br /><br />Chuck<br /><br />http://www.pcola.com/sandspur/</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I use a router to handle everything for me now but if I remeber correctly I didnt have to do anything like that before.<br /><br />Setup ppoe, give my username and pass and its on. I didnt have to go to that url.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">FYI, you don't give your machine a host name if you are using DHCP because the DHCP server will likely assign one to the machine when it connects.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It would really assign a hostname to the machine? &nbsp;Is that a DSL only thing because I don't think that's ever happened to me with the cable modem. &nbsp;I get a dynamic IP, but the hostnames I supply myself.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hmm. Maybe just Mediacom does it, but its a something the DHCP server does/can do. To find out, you could <div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">ifconfig eth0</div> and <div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">cat /etc/hostname</div> and see if there's a difference.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you are sitting behind a router/Firewall then &quot;it&quot; will get the Host name. Last time I checked Cox assigns a host name through DHCP also. The device that's connected directly to the cable modem should get &quot;ALL&quot; of it's info from the upstream provider. This is normally only for home users to make life easier and so the ISP can identify who's connected and where.<br /><br />I can't speak for DSL as I haven't had much experience with them.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Bellsouth DSL DOES NOT assign a hostname. They use ip, reverse dns, and probably the network port to track the user if needed.<br /><br /><br />For future reference dhcp assining a hostname is not a standard setup except for maybe in the ISP world.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have no idea how it worked, &nbsp;but previously I had trouble getting Mandrake 9 to work with BellSouth DSL. &nbsp; Got no success. &nbsp;<br />Later I installed RedHat on a whim, and it instantly recognized my DSL modem and correctly configured it automatically, and I was up and running.<br /><br />Perhaps you can do the same........ use RedHat 9 to get it going, and document all the necessary data to configure the Linux distro you really want to use.<br /><br />thoughts from a Newbie.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have had problems in the past with different dhcp clients working with some isps and others not. When I was living in Houston on Roadrunner, I had to use pump because dhcpcd wouldn't work.</div>
