					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have been looking at them for awhile now and would most definitely get the one with the solid state disk. I can guarantee I will have one before July 4th :).<br /><br />Here is link at the one I am looking at. http://astore.amazon.com/asuslaptops-20/detail/B000YEMKGY/002-4767823-1289601 (http://astore.amazon.com/asuslaptops-20/detail/B000YEMKGY/002-4767823-1289601)<br />4 gig solid state hard drive 512 meg of ram would get upgraded and Linux pre-installed......What&#039;s not to like. Excellent pen testing tool.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><br /><br />&nbsp; After much searching on the internet, I have decided to wait until the eeepc 900 hits the market and study reviews before I buy. I think I learned my lesson with the N770. I owned it just a few weeks and it was superseded by the N800 then rapidly by the 810. It appeared that as soon as the 800 came out support ceased for the 770. Looks as if the same thing is happening with the eeepc&nbsp; series.<br />&nbsp;Harold</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><br /><br />OK So I dug the old N770 out of the gadget drawer partly hidden by the old Palm IIIC and the Sharp `Wizard`. It appears that I am two updates behind. Now I will have to pull the &#039;How-tos` out and try to reflash the operating system so I can find out what I have been missing. If I have any problems, I will bring it with me to our next meeting.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Woodyharold<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Today the ASUS Eeepc900 is available at Newegg.com for $549. Both the XP and the Linux models. I am going to wait for awhile to see how they are accepted and also to see what the competition is going to be offering.<br />&nbsp; Woodyharold<br />&nbsp; </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">As I know have a nokia n770 and n800 and access to eecpc I still will take the nokia n770 for quick on the go and great battery life.<br />It is a little hard to find the 2 gig mmc card but that can be overcome and running gizmo on it for voip service is great all I need is wifi and I can make phone calls and web or ssh into remote machine or scan clients computers. Don&#039;t get me wrong the n800 is great and&nbsp; &nbsp;the n810 but just to bulky to fit into the front pocket of shirt :(<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay, does a post 2 months late still count?&nbsp; :D<br />A couple of weeks ago I got an eeePC 900 16GB w/ linux.&nbsp; I thought (and still think) it&#039;s the &quot;bee&#039;s knees&quot;, but it had a couple of drawbacks:<br />1.&nbsp; Getting the thing changed into a conventional linux desktop was a pain, and afterward every app I tried to install had several dependencies, and at least one dependent app would not be available.&nbsp; Arrrgh!&nbsp; The stock linux is Xandros, an the shipped apps were a bit out of date.&nbsp; (Open Office 2.0, etc.)<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Battery life was....okay.&nbsp; 2-1/2 hours<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Keyboard was smallish.&nbsp; I&#039;m okay with that, as I became accustomed to smallish keyboards in the clamshell Windows CE days (okay, I&#039;m old.)&nbsp; Some people find this challenging.&nbsp; If you tend to type with only two fingers anyway -- and you know who you are -- you won&#039;t be offended.&nbsp; The keyboard reminds me of an old HP Jornada. <br /><br />4. The eeePC has a known glitch discussed on the forums that causes it to drain its battery slightly when powered off and unplugged from AC. AFAIK, that still exists.<br /><br />Long story short, it took me only a few days to dump the stock OS, repartition the SSD and load Mandriva.&nbsp; I chose Mandriva based on my forum research where noobish eeePC users like myself had the most success with painless installation.&nbsp; The result is Linux on a very portable &quot;netbook&quot; that is fully functioning w/ decent speed scalling and power adjustments; and battery life pushing 4-ish hours. <br /><br />If you are willing to trade a little horsepower for portability, I highly recommend it. If you snag one of the deals currently available, you can get one for the price of a high end iPod.&nbsp; I&#039;m not particularly a gamer or photophile -- more like a forum surfer.&nbsp; But I love mine. <br /><br />One other glitch.&nbsp; I also subscribe to several podcasts, and .m4a is apparently a common codec for the video podcasts.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t exist in Mandriva Free, and even Mandriva PowerPack doesn&#039;t include all of Fluendo&#039;s codecs.&nbsp; Unless someone has an open-source suggestion, I&#039;m getting ready to throw some money at Fluendo to appease my addiction.&nbsp; <br /><br />In other news:&nbsp; I go out of town frequently, so I&#039;ve had a hard time keeping up with your club events and schedules.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been trying for the last year to catch up with a meeting, but with (obviously) no success.&nbsp; *Noob alert*<br /><br />Mark</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for the tip, looks like an interesting podcast. I have seen in the forums where some eee-tuned distros are showing up, including - what else - eeebuntu.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was in PCola Best Buy yesterday, and they now have the same eeePC that I have, the 16GB 900, in stock for $449.&nbsp; It&#039;s running XP, but that&#039;s easy to correct.&nbsp; (I wonder if they packaged it with an XP OEM disc that you could sell aftermarket?)</div>
