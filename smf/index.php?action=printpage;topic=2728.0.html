					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sure you would! I installed AA with ZERO problems. Most games that have Linux Installers give you little to no troubles...typically. If you do have any problems, then we can surely help you fix it or find a fix for you.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sounds like it&#039;s worth a try.&nbsp; Thanks<br /><br />about the configuring stuff.......&nbsp; it&#039;s just that my past experience with Linux has been that nothing seemed to install easily.&nbsp; It was always a process of researching into how to install software, how to configure my soundcard, trying to find the additional files to get something to work properly.....and I never could get Flash audio to work properly.<br /><br />Mandriva 2006 seems to have fixed most of that.&nbsp; I&#039;m loving this distribution.&nbsp; The only glitch I have discovered so far is my Canon Pixma printer doesn&#039;t work correctly.&nbsp; But that&#039;s a different forum issue.<br /><br />Guess I&#039;ll download AA and give it a try.&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks again.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You won&#039;t get your Pixma working with opensource drivers. You may be able to find some drivers that you have to pay for. I have a Pixma and gave up on it a long time ago. I boot to Windows to use Photoshop to print photos. My HP Laserjet 1160 does a fine job for my Linux printing needs...but this is terribly off topic.<br /><br />Let us know how the install of AA goes. We&#039;ll be more than happy to help should you need it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">oh........ one more thing I just noticed.&nbsp; &nbsp;this punkbuster software that has to be installed along with the AA program....... when reading the disclaimer it says that it will have almost free access to all my computer files.&nbsp; And if I don&#039;t agree to the terms and conditions, it won&#039;t let me continue installing AA.&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m not comfortable with that at all.&nbsp; &nbsp;Do you guys feel comfortable with PunkBuster ?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">so.....<br />well actually I downloaded the Windows version to my Windows side of my computer just to take a look at it.&nbsp; After the download, when I was starting to go through the installation process...that&#039;s where the terms and conditions regarding PB was displayed.&nbsp; Either one agrees to their terms or there is no installation.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Since this morning I have downloaded the game Americas Army to my Linux side;&nbsp; but have no idea how to get the file &quot; armyops250-linux.run &quot;&nbsp; to start the installation process.&nbsp; &nbsp; which is what I was refering to earlier about being frustrated by not knowing how to do things in Linux.&nbsp; &nbsp; I know I need to spend the time to get more familiar with Linux commands, but with working full time,&nbsp; going to college full time,&nbsp; trying to learn a foreign language....... there never seems to be time to read the books.&nbsp; which is why I was looking for the diversion to being with.<br /><br />Anybody willing to help me install this thing?&nbsp; Thanks</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Quick answer...<br /><br />Open a terminal, and assuming you have the installer in your home directory, type the following.<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">$ sh armyops250-linux.run</div><br />Otherwise, use the command &quot;cd&quot; to &quot;change directories&quot; to the place the file is located.<br /><br />Also, I second Dan on Punkbuster. It is included with most online games because it <i>keeps people from cheating</i>. The folks who make Punkbuster are very well known and respected. Maybe it&#039;s good to be that paranoid, but relax a little bit. And this leads me into my next point.<br /><br />Don&#039;t be afraid of Google. If you would have searched for punkbuster or how to install AA on Linux, you would have easily found it on the first page of your search. Learning Linux and UNIX is all about reading documentation. People&#039;s patience within the community is pretty high, but they also don&#039;t put up with people not doing a some of the leg work. No one wants to be a Google proxy. I haven&#039;t learned anything about Linux and UNIX from a book that isn&#039;t otherwise available on the Internet.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks Rugmonster.&nbsp; &nbsp; I know what you mean about at least doing some looking around.&nbsp; I generally don&#039;t post a question in here, or other forums until I&#039;ve tried to find the answer on my own, and still don&#039;t understand or can&#039;t find an answer.<br />As you suggested, I did a Google search for PB and found some info about it being an anti-cheat software..... but never having heard of it before, and not being a gamer..... I&#039;m cautious, and hense the question of whether anyone is familiar with it.<br /><br />Thanks again for your help</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">oh......... I forgot to add,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;when I looked for how to open and install that game,&nbsp; I did find some information;&nbsp; almost the same as you provided, however it didn&#039;t work.&nbsp; &nbsp;What I had found was to go into terminal and type :&nbsp; armyops250-linux.run<br />the information failed to instruct me to type the preceding data as you did.<br /><br />now I&#039;m going to go see if it will work<br />later.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That simply means that your download did not go well. You need to re-download and try again. Nothing wrong on your part with not knowing what to do. This is easily fixed by just re-downloading. Then try again.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">next...<br /><br />I have trashed the previous download of AA and have successfully downloaded the file again.&nbsp; I was able to get the file to start installing.... if that&#039;s what one would call it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I typed in the sh armyops250-linux.run&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; came back that archive integrity was all good and started uncompressing the file.......&nbsp; that was almost an hour ago.<br /><br />Is that normal?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Try typing armyops from a command line. That should have been in the documentation somewhere.<br /><br />When I installed it in Mandriva, it put a menu item at: Star | Games | Americas Army (or something like that).<br /><br />Hopefully that helps. I hate to agree, but stuff like this should not happen. It is much easier in Windows (not that I have tried it). Regardless of what anyone says, I should not have to read a single line in a README to know how to start a game that I just installed.<br /><br />Good luck.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Try just shooting the terrorists, and not the good guys.&nbsp; (also don&#039;t shoot any unarmed ppl).<br /><br />They just put this in the game to try and get you in the habit of only shooting the opposing force.&nbsp; Trust me, the lil dress down the sgt gives you is nothing compared to the flak you&#039;ll take online for shooting teammates.&nbsp; Take your time, and only shoot terrorists that are armed.&nbsp; (skinny, dark = enemy.&nbsp; cammo, backpack = friendly)&nbsp; <br />Alot of people&nbsp; fuss about the training you go through, but most of it really does help you in game, all it takes is a little patience.<br /><br />Honestly, I found AA itself to be quite easy to install.&nbsp; Getting PB up and running takes a little more time, but isn&#039;t that hard.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You&#039;re right David,&nbsp; &nbsp;I wasn&#039;t thinking.&nbsp; ok,&nbsp; here&#039;s how I did it.&nbsp; &nbsp;And now everybody will know just how much of a Newbie I am..... totally naive. (grin)<br /><br />I used Konqueror to look in the armyops directory.&nbsp; I was looking for a file that had an icon resembling a sprocket but there were none so I thought it was in a sub directory.&nbsp; I tried opening every sub directory with no success.&nbsp; Then as I said earlier, I just started trying anything.&nbsp; I double clicked on a file that had an icon that looks like a black rectangle inside a white rectangle with the lower right corner folded up.&nbsp; The AA logo appeared in the center of my monitor and the game started.<br /><br />For those of you familiar with getting your hands into Linux, this probably sounded really lame.&nbsp; For me however,&nbsp; it&#039;s just embarrasing.<br /><br />and Brent...... thanks for the tips.&nbsp; I&#039;ll try and see how long it takes me to get through MOUT.&nbsp; I thought I&#039;d never get out of the obstical course. About the time I got fast enough with the manouvering to make the time limit, the darn game would throw me off of the climbing walls.&nbsp; (laughing)<br />I think I&#039;m going to have to adjust my settings also..... because it&#039;s so dark in the house that I can just barely see any difference in clothes or details between the good guys and the enemies.<br /><br />Thanks all.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well,&nbsp; I have pretty much determined that I won&#039;t be able to play AA on my current computer system.&nbsp; The game is working ok now, it&#039;s just that I probably don&#039;t have enough memory, or a fast enough processor, or perhaps it&#039;s my video card.&nbsp; Anyway, the symptoms are that my mouse ( rifle sight ) moves too slowly, and when I try to walk through the shoot house, there is considerable lag between where I want to go, and where my character actually goes.&nbsp; I keep running into obsticles, and getting stuck next to the doorway, but not being able to quickly go through a doorway.&nbsp; It&#039;s like the mouse over-corrects.<br /><br />In another time with a more advanced system.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Brent,&nbsp; &nbsp; I did what you instructed.&nbsp; I first need to mention that when I went into the game to do this, I noticed that the video action seemed a little more unresponsive than it normally is.&nbsp; The fps I was able to get was only averaging about 15 or 16, with a maximum of 19.&nbsp; Based on the numbers given, and the sluggishness tonight,&nbsp; I&#039;d say that when I normally play the fps is probably around 25 to 30.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ll try to get it to work as it normally does so that I can get a legitimate read.<br /><br />Evidently this is not good.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to look around and try to see how I might improve the fps.<br /><br />later</div>

Again I looked at the FPS, and was shocked.&nbsp; The average fps was around 10 and the highest it read was about 12.5<br />I have an ASUS A7N266-E motherboard with built-in Nvidia Gforce-2 GPU.&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m guessing that&#039;s ancient now.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">In April, I&#039;m buying a new video card. My ATI 9800XT 256MB will be getting sold after that. I&#039;ll let you guys have first crack at it before it goes on Ebay.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If your interested in Quake I have pretty good instructions on how to install the orginal or classic Quake and also Quake3. They should run ok on your computer. You do need the Nvidia drivers installed first. </div>
