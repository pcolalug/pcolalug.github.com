					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I was hoping for some guidance.&nbsp; I have VERY recently started to move away from windows. I am using Ubuntu 10.10 on a couple of my machines.&nbsp; I am just about as new to Linux as you can be and my knowledge is extremely limited.&nbsp; I have been playing around with the system for a few days and I am getting somewhat used to it.&nbsp; The GUI interface is pretty good and makes it easy for someone such as myself to get to know Linux.<br /><br />That being said, I would really like to know more.&nbsp; It seems to me that the real power is at the command line level and that is still alchemy from where I&#039;m sitting.&nbsp; I was hoping for suggestions as to reading I might do or if there are noob level tutorials out there that might help me increase my skill.<br /><br />One of my goals is to build a cluster (which is what got me interested in the first place). I have been playing around with the concept but it became apparent almost immediately that I just didn&#039;t have the skill set to pull it together.&nbsp; I live in Pensacola and was hoping to get involved in the users group. So any help or suggestions that you have will be much appreciated.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi and welcome!&nbsp; You&#039;ve come to the right place for guidance.&nbsp; We&#039;re a social group, and most of us would be more than willing to help out someone just starting out with Linux, and we&#039;ve got a few members who have experience in clustering for themselves, too.&nbsp; Stick around, ask any questions you&#039;d like, make a few meetings, and hop on our IRC (#pcolalug on freenode or http://pcolalug.org/irc/irc.cgi) to talk to someone as well.<br /><br />Ian</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">On the command line you&#039;ll just learn to make tasks quicker as you need them... its hard to just learn tools and remember how to use them without having an actual problem to use them with.<br /><br />But the big tools you&#039;ll want to play with are find, grep, cut, and awk.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />You can also read about bash scripting here: http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html<br /><br />Outside of that, if you have any things you are doing in the GUI right now and wonder how to handle it in CLI just ask here and we&#039;ll let you know the alternative ways to do it!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome to Linux!&nbsp; A good starting point is the Linux Starter Pack, a nifty little guide for beginners.&nbsp; It&#039;s got a good list of different programs, but it&#039;s not very advanced in terms of using the terminal.<br /><br />http://www.tuxradar.com/linuxstarterpack<br /><br />For the most part you won&#039;t really need to use the CLI if you&#039;re just getting your feet wet.&nbsp; The CLI may seem intimidating at first but really it&#039;s not that difficult.&nbsp; After you learn basic navigation I suggest installing a few games and other terminal-based applications.<br /><br />http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/play-games-inside-your-linux-terminal/</div>
