					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Has anyone been able to accomplish this??? &nbsp;I have been unable to complete it. &nbsp;Basically when the installation script asks for a CD change (there's 3 CD's to the game), it will not recognize that the disc has been changed out and you have to cancel. &nbsp;Anybody got any clues? &nbsp;Thanks.<br />Dan<br /><br />P.S. - I have successfully set up the following games if anyone needs any assistance with them:<br />Return to Castle Wolfenstein<br />Quake3 Arena<br />TuxRacer<br />Chromium</div>

The names for each CD that the installer uses are different than what the actual CDs themselves are labelled. &nbsp;So if the installer asks for the PlayCD, give it CD 1, etc.<br /><br />Hope this helps! If you've got any questions about any of this, or if it doesn't work, post them here.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Maybe this is crazy, but isn't the HL engine code freely available? Makes me wonder why the folks at icculus.org haven't ported it...<br /><br />Oh, and I never had to do the steps crowe describes to install UT2K3. In RedHat 8, I just inserted the cdrom, opened a terminal window and ran the installer from the CD. I did have to mount/unmount the cd, IIRC, and the fact that the disk labels don't match what the installer asks for is a pain, but the install ran smoothly, if not forever...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Got it! &nbsp;Although there is a catch... &nbsp;I followed crowe's suggestions above, and was still getting the problem of the cdrom not being recognized as mounted. &nbsp;After some teeth-gnashing, I thought I'd try disabling Mandrake's &quot;supermount&quot; function for removable drives. &nbsp;It still didn't work. &nbsp;So I wrote the changes to my fstab <div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">supermount -i disable</div> and rebooted the machine. &nbsp;That was it! &nbsp;You do still need two terminal windows, one for the installer/output and one for the manual CD mount/unmount. &nbsp;So the lesson learned here is that Supermount (although useful) is not always wanted...<br /><br />Thanks, crowe, for the tips! &nbsp;I haven't played this game in awhile, and had forgotten how cool it is. &nbsp;Should be a productive weekend... &nbsp; :lol: <br /><br />Rugmonster - (from your other thread) - this is the game you should try next! &nbsp;Good stuff.</div>
