					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">O.K. So where do I begin. &nbsp;First of my name is Lance Rochelle (that would a mundane name), other people call me Hrólfr Ásbjarnarsson. Probably should explain that eh? (oh and I am not from Canada) &nbsp;I belong to a historical education society that reenacts the middle ages (from 650 A.D. to 1650 A.D.) mainly from Europe though. &nbsp;At the moment I am living in Charlotte, NC. &nbsp;I will be moving back to Pensacola. &nbsp;I am an avid computer geek. I use or have used just about every OS out there from Aegis, Linux, Windows (yes I said it), Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, MVS, BSD, OS X. &nbsp;I currently work for a pretty large company as a Senior Systems Administrator. &nbsp;At the moment the flavor of Linux that I am using is Gentoo, which is extremely well oriented for the power user. &nbsp;The OS I primarily support is Solaris on large frame machines. &nbsp;I do a lot with GNU projects. &nbsp;I also attend school on-line at University of Phoenix trying to attain my Business Management degree.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Nice to meet you, maybe I'll see you in person some day :)<br /><br />BTW: Do you have another tech-type job lined up in p'cola? &nbsp;How do you like Univ Phoenix? &nbsp;I was thinking of doing the extra year or so once I have my BS in CIS to get my MBA, not sure yet though. &nbsp;<br /><br />Good luck with the move.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Actually I do have a job lined up down there, thanks for asking, however I am always looking for more work. &nbsp;I am typical I don't sleep period (well ok so I have to sleep sometime) More often then not I generally work from 9am to 5pm do my medieval stuff, and classes til 11pm then work from 11pm til I fall asleep which is generally around 4am. &nbsp;UofPhx is pretty nice. &nbsp;The classes are only 5 weeks long rather then a standard semester, and they are basically using a secured news server to do class threadings. The biggest problem is participation, it's required that you attend at least 5 days out of 7 for 4 out of 5 weeks. So far though I haven't actually taken a test, it is so far mainly based on feedback from discussion type questions. &nbsp;The move is going to be hard cause I have to consolidate two apartments into one house, which I close on the day before the I leave here. :) oh the fun</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">No problem, I am supposed to close on my house somewhere between the 7/17 date and the 8/1 date. &nbsp;As I am moving over 500 miles I need to be flexible. &nbsp;I am a bit nervous though *lol*. But heck I am always up for a good laugh and or move for that matter. &nbsp;Should be a very interesting move as I am doing it over a weekend (kinda long, I am taking monday and tuesday off from work) to move unpack, and get my iNet setup correctly. &nbsp;Are there any preferences in the area Cable vs. DSL. &nbsp;I have had both, but I refuse to usae PPPoE as it drops the MTU size down by 8 bytes (which usually isn't a problem) except if your webservers the face the internet are Solaris boxes (any version from 2.51 to 9) and you haven't forces the MTU setting on the card then you can't get to the site. &nbsp;(OK for that tid bit of information please don't ask how I found out about it). &nbsp;Anyway the question still stands.<br /><br />In the Pcola area DSL or Cable (or something else)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you are moving to Gulf Breeze / Milton / Navarre, get DSL, but if you'll be in Pensacola I'd go with Cox Cable - seems a little faster. &nbsp;The only problem with Cable in Gulf Breeze area is the company providing it, I have heard they're getting better though.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ooh wait I just re-read your message. &nbsp;If you plan to run a webserver at home better go with DSL, I think cox cable blocks all your server ports.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">just a few quick questions. Possibly already answered, (yes i am lazy) do you guys hang out in any irc channels during the week, or is the main communication through the forum here ? also what is one of the better local stores for parts and pieces, and well is there any risc processor shops around &nbsp;?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would recommend Southeastern Computers (http://www.secomp.com/) on Palafox Blvd. just south of Brent Ln. They usually have little parts that no one else is going to carry locally. If they don't have it on sale on the salesfloor, you can ask them to dig in one of their old junk boxes and find what you need.<br /><br />I only buy stuff from them when I don't have time to wait for the UPS man.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Some nice folks work there, I go hangout and chit-chat sometimes. &nbsp;But I can't pay thier prices, seem high for most stuff. &nbsp;(I got a power supply there at a decent price though). &nbsp;When I buy local it's usually Emerald Coast Computers on 9th. &nbsp;Only problem is they're not much into retail anymore, so slim pickings.<br /><br />Most of my stuff comes from tcwo.com, not a complaint yet. &nbsp;I think others here have tried them also.<br /><br />IRC - we tried, but some of us couldn't get on the servers for one reason or another, so it never got figured out. &nbsp;I spend time on #linuxhelp on efnet helping newbies find their way, but they cut off my IRC access from work so I'm not their much anymore :(<br /><br />Nick</div>
