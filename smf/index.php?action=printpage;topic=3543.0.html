					Title: <b>August 2009 Meeting - LAN Party</b><br />
					Post by: <b>dpeach</b> on <b>June 22, 2009, 09:54:43 pm</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">At the June meeting we started talking about doing a LAN party for the August meeting date. August normal meeting would be the 20th. It was proposed that we do a LAN party the 22nd (the following Saturday). This would be in lieu of the normal meeting. We need you to do a few things for us.<br /><br />Will you make an effort to be there? Please post your interest and if it is possible for you to be there. This does not signify a full commitment at this time, but we want to make sure there is enough possible interest to do a LAN party again. The reason we stopped was they were less and less in attendance.<br /><br />Will your propose a game? We are planning to have an ET (Enemy Territory) server up and running. This is our old standby game. Please plan to install and play ET. But don&#039;t practice too much, I need some chance of killing someone and surviving more than just a few minutes. But do you have another game you would like to play? Would you be willing to put together a game server for that night and let us know what game it is?<br /><br />Will you tell others about the LAN party? We want to use this to get potential new members. They don&#039;t have to be running Linux to attend the party. Though they might take some verbal abuse, there will not be any broken bones. Bring along anyone you know who is even mildly interested in Linux. We would love to have them. Especially if they stink at ET.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I will definitely be attending.&nbsp; I&#039;ll install any game that I can possibly run, and will try to get a few friends to attend.<br /><br />Games I would suggest (from my presentation).<br /><br />Nexuiz<br />AssaultCube<br />Sauerbraten<br />Tremulous<br />BZ Flag/Scorched 3D<br />Urban Terror</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am planning to come.&nbsp; I will make an effort to get an ET server running before then, although we can always just use an internet-accessible one as well.<br /><br />As a reminder to anyone who may not be interested in gaming, but wanting some help with installation of Linux or solving a problem, there will be plenty of time (and help) available for those kinds of activities as well.&nbsp; Bring your computer/laptop, and we&#039;ll get things going for you!<br /><br />Danke!<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Still on! Plenty of time to invite other gamers. Space limitation will be 20 people (just guessing). If we don&#039;t have enough room for all of us in the main meeting room, we can string up routers and go into the halls with our boxes as long as that is acceptable by the venue.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">At this point, a month after talking about it, and a month before it is supposed to happen, there are *THREE* people (including myself!) who have confirmed their intention to attend.<br /><br />That&#039;s not very good.<br /><br />Is anyone else planning to participate?&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure I will bother with something like this after all, if that&#039;s all the interest there is.<br /><br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I know I&#039;ll be bringing at least 1 other guest.&nbsp; So, you can up that to 4 confirmed as per this thread.<br /><br />Perhaps at the meeting tonight it&#039;d be a good idea to remind people about this, as well as for them to RSVP of sorts in this thread.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">What time have we historically started the LAN parties? I was thinking it was 5 or 6 and then we had a break for the 7:00 meeting if we wanted to still do a meeting program. I guess the time question has to be coordinated with Lloyd.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have anyone that I am bringing yet, but I definitely plan to be there. We also want to bring a few bucks for pizza.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay, so the LAN party is in 22 days.<br /><br />Who&#039;s bringing what, and what games are we playing?&nbsp; Who&#039;s gonna host?&nbsp; etc...</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I won&#039;t be able to set up a game server. I have to pass on being the host for that. I will be out of town until late Friday night, or Saturday morning which will make it difficult for me to get anything going. And, more practically, I haven&#039;t the foggiest idea of how to do it.<br /><br />We need to get confirmation from Lloyd that the location will be available as early as 2:00. That sounds like a great time to start for me.<br /><br />I will load up ET and be ready to play. We need someone to commit to running a game server for that. Then anything else we want to play that needs to be hosted, someone needs to commit to.</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I had said at a previous meeting that I could probably get an ET server together...&nbsp; That isn&#039;t looking so likely now.&nbsp; Very busy with work and some other things, and probably won&#039;t get it done.&nbsp; It&#039;s actually not really needed though, as the game can be played just as well on any available (internet) server.&nbsp; The game has a built-in server browser.<br /><br />At this point I&#039;m not sure I&#039;ll even be able to make it.&nbsp; Been working most weekends and will probably have to work that Saturday too.&nbsp; We&#039;ll see, and I am going to try and arrange it so I can go.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Does someone have any way to contact Lloyd for me please, or pass his number along to me? If we don&#039;t hear from him by Monday, I can get his work number from their website and call him. I am currently in Mexico and will be driving back starting Monday morning. I will probably have limited Internet access along the way, but will check in as often as I can to help coordinate the event as possible.<br /><br />The original plan was to NOT have a Thursday meeting and make the LAN party our meeting for this month. If we are going to have 6 or more for the event, and it looks like we should, then I think we will have a great time.<br /><br />We need to confirm the time with the key holder and get that posted to the announcements.<br /><br />Sorry I have been absent this week. Believe it or not, I really do have a job. I know driving around Mexico for a month spending time in villages without Internet access may sound like a vacation to some people, but it is what some of us get to do for work. I am trying to help the LUG out as best I can this year with the time and resources I have available.</div>

I&#039;ll be at the office between 3 and 4 on saturday for a while but I&#039;ve got a long list of things to do on my day off which I&#039;m averaging 12-19 days straight working 10+hrs in between a day or 2 off. _IF_ there are for sure 7-8+ people going to show up and actually be there not including myself, I will open the doors. but last few years of lan parties has been basically me, ian, ian&#039;s brother, and kevin sitting in conference room twiddling our thumbs because the other 6 or 8 people that said they would make it, somehow never made it.... <br /><br />also, is anyone have game server figured out? we have a full T1 1.5mbit up/down, which won&#039;t get far if people are just connecting to an outside server....<br /><br /><br />BTW, yall can thank Danc for being the one to contact my cell (I believe friday afternoon?) to let me know about this post.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thank you Lloyd for chiming in, and to danc for getting the message to him.<br /><br />We still need someone to commit to working up a game server if outside bandwidth will be a problem.<br /><br />I am still sweating it out in Mexico, but am working my way to Pensacola all week long. The ETA currently is to arrive in Pcola on Friday night to be at the LAN party Saturday afternoon. Things rarely go as planned here and we are now 3 days behind our original scheduled leaving date. Therefore, I cannot say that I am totally confirmed for being there Saturday. I will say that my wife and I are committed to me being there if at all possible. It is simply a matter of roads, trailer, police, military and speed bumps that will all do their best to slow us down.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, things are looking up a little.&nbsp; &nbsp;:o<br /><br />I have found a CD from 2005 on which I stored a tarball of a working ET Server that we used at a LAN party.&nbsp; Perhaps for just such an occasion as this.&nbsp; I will give it my best effort in the next couple of days, to see if I can make it work.&nbsp; If so, I&#039;ll bring the server to the party.&nbsp; As Lloyd stated, if there are only 3-4 people there I won&#039;t be bothering to stick around.&nbsp; I&#039;ll let you all know by Wednesday night if I can do this.&nbsp; Thanks to all for showing some interest!<br /><br /></div>

We were only able to travel 4 hours today. That did not get us very far. Still a possibility that I will be there, but I am less hopeful.<br /><br />(http://www.dpeach.com/pics/misc/broken_trailer.JPG)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">In light of current events I believe it is more than apparent that the LAN party will not happen this weekend.&nbsp; With that said I will officially announce that the LAN party has gone bust.&nbsp; Thanks to all who said they&#039;d make it and showed enthusiasm, but Murphy&#039;s Law seems to have reared it&#039;s ugly head once again.<br /><br />Dan, thank you for preparing an ET Server, your labor shall not be in vain, as I am sure we will eventually have a LAN party one of these days and will definitely need it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for trying to make this happen guys. I appreciate the effort put out by each person who was involved.<br /><br />Yossarian, can you please write up a post on the announcements section about the LAN party not taking place this weekend and send an email through the forums? I still have not figured out the announcement and email thing. Since I have you smarter guys to help, I will let you do it.</div>
