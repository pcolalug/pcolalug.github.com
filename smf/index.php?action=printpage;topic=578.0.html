					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here is an article (http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=8472) that talks about Office Depot pulling any products that connect to a computer that does not cary the &quot;Designed for XP&quot; logo. If you do not read the whole article (it is short), then at least read the second part that includes the letter that was sent to Office Depot suppliers.<br /><br />This includes hardware and software. They have already offcially pulled the Zaurus from their offerings.<br /><br />Microsoft is putting a stranglehold on the market.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just imagine a Redhat box with the designed for Windows XP logo on it.... Ok, some things just can't be imagined, but I bet the Justice department is interested in this backdoor scheme.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hmmmm.... &nbsp;I'd like to make a point, and would first throw out a disclaimer that I'm not defending Microsoft at all, and am not a huge fan of Microsoft although I do use some of their products, sometimes.<br /><br />OK. &nbsp;While this deal does seem a little shady on the surface, think about this: &nbsp;There are many other places to buy computer products other than Office Depot. &nbsp;You can go someplace else. &nbsp;The comeback to that is probably that this is just the first retailer, and there will be others. &nbsp;Maybe that's true. &nbsp;However, exclusive agreements between manufacturers and retailers are not at all uncommon in the business world. &nbsp;A few examples: &nbsp;If you want to buy gasoline at a Tom Thumb store, you buy Citgo. &nbsp;No other choice. &nbsp;But, you can certainly go just down the road to buy another brand. &nbsp;Does every clothing store sell Levi's brand jeans? &nbsp;Nope. &nbsp;There are many other examples if you think about it.<br /><br />Anyway, while I would prefer to not see this kind of deal made, I don't think it's illegal or immoral. &nbsp;This particular store thinks it's best for their future sales, and time will tell if they chose correctly. &nbsp;With the growing power of Linux perhaps we'll see that they made a bad choice. &nbsp;<br /><br />That's my opinion, anyway. &nbsp;/asbestos-suit mode &quot;on&quot;/<br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Oh, I definately agree with you Dan. They can choose to sell out to anyone they want. I just think that it is interesting that they have. <br /><br />No it is not immoral or illegal, but interesting.</div>
