					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Are there any programs out there that manage a website in linux? I have some particular tastes though. <br /><br />I'd like something that does layout in CSS(no ugly hacks or workarounds for IE when possible).<br />A visual editor, though it does not have to be WYSIWYG(That way I can click to insert something where I want it instead of searching through code to find it).<br />I'd prefer the application to run on my computer and not on the server.<br />I want the ability to add and delete items quickly(such as news items, maybe a list of items to delete or when I want to add one I click where I'd like to add it and a pop-up asks for the pertinent information).<br />I want a template so new pages can be added quickly.<br />I want items to be grouped, so that if I add a menu item to a menu, it gets updated on all pages and I don't have to edit each page individually.<br />I'd like the ability to store the files on the server and check them out, so that only one person could edit it at a time.<br />I'd like an RCS like ability to revert to a former page if I mess up or just like the old layout better.<br />A seperate test and live code area so that I can test it without messing up the live site.<br />No database or web server required. The last thing I want to do is install a db and a web server for a non techie so that they can edit simple news items on the site.<br />Open source would be nice in case I need to extend the functionality, but I am willing to pay(not that those are mutually exclusive).<br /><br /><br />Anyways, I have looked at Mambo and Jetbox and neither seemed to be what I was looking for. I also played with Plone, but rather briefly. It is possible Plone could do some of this, but I confess I didn't take a lot of time to see. Does anyone have any experience with an application that meets some of those requirements? Maybe a windows app I could get to run under wine? I have never had any luck with wine, but who knows? Or is my best bet to install win2k and dreamweaver? Or to write it from scratch?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don't really understand. &nbsp;Do you want a server-side content management system such as plone, or do you want something that runs on your computer to edit html files such as Dreamweaver?<br /><br />If you are talking content management, and your site is relatively small I'd say just code from scratch. &nbsp;If you are looking for something to run on &nbsp;your computer to edit html files wysiwyg style I'd suggest looking into NVU for a purely linux solution, or if you have the money get Dreamweaver (it runs very well under Crossover's wine (http://www.codeweavers.com/) as you can see here (http://homeweb.org/~imnes/linux/slackware/screens/wine-4-apps.png).).<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Don't ask for much, do ya ;)? I'm with imnes on this one. If you're looking for site <i>design</i> Dreamweaver can't be beat, IMHO. NVU looks promising as well. You may also like to try Quanta. No WYSIWYG as such, but a nice web development tool.<br /><br />As for CMS, Zope/Plone is good. There are tons out there (slashcode comes to mind). However, the system having everything you describe doesn't exist, AFAIK, especially if you want templated, dynamic, non-server-side content. Sounds like an interesting project, though.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for the advice guys. I've been using Quanta which is nice and I don't mind hand coding my html from scratch, it is the maintenance that tends to be a bother. Maybe I'll see if I can code up a solution similar to what I am looking for. Thanks again.<br /><br />Todd</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">A php, perl or asp and db solution could be the easiest solution for you. It isn't hard to setup Apache+PHP+MySQL.</div>
