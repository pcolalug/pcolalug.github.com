					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I was using Linux in Milton when I lived there and knew at least three other folks that used it while I lived there...and that was when the 2.2 kernel was bleeding edge!!! Maybe I'll get back in touch with the couple that are still in the area and get them to meetings for you guys &nbsp;:)</div>
