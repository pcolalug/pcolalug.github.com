					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Does anybody know how to force the screen refresh rate in Enemy Territory? Whenever I start ET, my laptop display goes nuts, but my flat panel attached to the laptop still works like a champ. X was doing the same thing, and when I locked the refresh rate to 60hz, it seemed to fix the problem.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">errrr dunno, anything below 75Hz kills me....well atleast on a CRT <br /><br />i know sometimes the resolution on ET for me changes itself to 800x600 and i have to scroll around the menus to go in and change the resolution again...but never had a refresh rate issue....in linux?<br /><br />possibly the resolution your laptop monitor runs natively at is way off from what ET wants or what your xf86config file is setup for...or refresh rate goes out of sync at that certain res?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Weirdest thing... jumped out of et to restart the server, started it up again, and it worked no problems. Anybody else had an issue where their laptop screen gets out of sync, and resetting it fixes it?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am not sure if you are saying you are running two monitors or if you are running just one at once. &nbsp;If you are trying to run two monitors then that might be the problem, ET doesn't support dual monitors or whatever for some reason, I think you can set one to view your desktop while the other is in the game. &nbsp;I run an Enemy Territory forum for anyone who is hardcore in the game its www.enemyterritoryunited.com if you guys want to check it out. &nbsp;I created the site for teams who play on the team warfare league ladder, its mainly a forum but there is also downloads and articles. &nbsp;I offer teams a free private and public forum so they can stay in communication with one another for free.</div>
