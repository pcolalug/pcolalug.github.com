					Title: <b>USB drives</b><br />
					Post by: <b>woodyharold</b> on <b>April 14, 2008, 09:25:58 pm</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><br />I just finished wrestling with &quot;the bug&quot; so while spending time indoors I was able to get in some extra computer time to delve into areas previously ignored. Crowe recently mentioned using some diagnostic apps he had on a jump-drive and that piqued my curiosity about uses for the little pendrives that are getting so popular these days.Piqued enough to do some googling about pendrives, booting from USB drives and a little bit about remastering live cds. Until now all I had ever used the USB drives for was for temporary storage and to transfer files from one computer to another. I was amazed ( but then a lot of things about linux amazes me) at how simple it is, using the tools available, to make live cds and bootable jump-drive operating systems. WWW.pendrivelinux.com has a wealth of helpful information on various distributions including remastering ubuntu. I know there must be many more uses for the little drives than the few I have been using.Maybe someone can let us know of their experiences with them.<br /><br />Woodyharold</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for the info and link.<br /><br />Currently, I&#039;m running Puppy Linux 3.0 from a 256 MB USB stick.&nbsp; Everything runs extremely fast since the whole Puppy distro loads entirely into memory.<br /><br />Since the prices of USB devices have dropped considerably, I may get a 4 GB stick and try running a larger distro, such as Ubuntu from USB.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">USB drives are great for running live distros.&nbsp; They&#039;re even better if you can set up a persistent home on them so you can save data.<br /><br />However, I&#039;ve tried installations from usb rather than burning a CD, and I&#039;ve noticed that whenever I do that, the GRUB boot loader ends up displaying multiple copies of the install after a few boots.&nbsp; Not sure if this has happened to anyone else though.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><br />I haven&#039;t tried an install from a USB Drive yet, but I intend to give it a try, also I agree the addition of a persistent partition greatly increases the usefulness.<br /><br />Tonight I downloaded a copy of the new Ubuntu 8.04 beta to use to practice on. I want to remaster the iso and install&nbsp; it on a USB Drive.<br />&nbsp; Woodyharold </div>
