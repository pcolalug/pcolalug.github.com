					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Gnome support has been steadily declining and I'm not really sure why. &nbsp;If you haven't noticed, the only major distributions actively supporting Gnome currently (in their stable releases) are Ubuntu and Fedora. &nbsp;<br /><br />Gnome 2.10 is going to be released pretty soon, and all the other major distro's (SuSE, Mandrake, Slackware) are still shipping their old Gnome 2.6 packages. &nbsp;In fact Slackware's gnome packages in the latest slackware release were last touched in May of last year, and the official word is Slackware 11 will not ship Gnome. &nbsp;<br /><br />Current slackware release also doesn't ship OpenOffice, FireFox, or Evolution.<br /><br />Don't know what Gentoo comes with I haven't really looked, guess I should check that out.<br /><br />In #slackware, Pat V was taking questions from people, and to the Gnome users asking about Gnome being completely removed in the next version his answer was if you want to run Gnome, go run Ubuntu.<br /><br />Who else here runs Gnome, and what distro and version are you using?<br /><br />I'm currently on Ubuntu Hoary. &nbsp;(Although I may start running Linspire on here full time again once the new release supports my video card).<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: imnes</div><div class="quote">Who else here runs Gnome, and what distro and version are you using?</div><br /><br />I use Gnome (2.6) with Mandrake 10.1 as my main machine. &nbsp;I also use Slackware with Dropline (2.8.2) and recently installed Ubuntu Hoary (2.9.2?) on my laptop.<br /><br />I agree that the number of distro's that favor Gnome are small, but... although Mandrake is considered a &quot;KDE distro&quot;, I've always used Gnome with it just fine. &nbsp;It's true that their version lags a little behind, but that isn't critical to me really. &nbsp;To tell you the truth, I don't see that much difference between 2.6 and 2.8. &nbsp;At least they're not KDE! &nbsp; :twisted: <br /><br />I think Mandrake 10.2 (due out next month) is supposed to have Gnome 2.10, but not certain of that. &nbsp;Dropline has changed hands, but looks like it will continue to be updated. &nbsp;Ubuntu looks promising, if I can get accustomed to some Debian weirdness... &nbsp;:?<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm running slackware 10.0 updated to pre-10.1 because of lack of time, planning to do a full upgrade to 10.1 -stable this weekend.<br /><br />running an older dropline 2.8.1 I believe it is, I've been getting tired of the unstable dropline packages as of lately so I've been sticking with older WORKING packages. If gnome 2.10 doesn't make massive improvements on gnome then I'm planning to go enlightenment or fluxbox</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The new Enlightenment is so pretty, but I wonder what kind of overhead it has...<br /><br />(back to the topic) I have always preferred Gnome over KDE, but had a hard time accepting either one. I love Gnome's simplicity, but sometimes that simplicity leaves me feeling like I'm missing something. KDE just seems to be following whatever track Windows is on with the exception of bringing Karamba into play. Maybe the Windows likness has been from the way the distro makers set up KDE.<br /><br />Either way, I'm not a huge fan of either. Maybe that's why my Linux box is currently console only. The stupid on-board video on the motherboard may have something else to do with it since I can't use another video card in the system. One of these days, I'm going to put together a new Linux system and I will have X on it. Like I used to do with distros, I'll check out all of the different WMs and find the one that works best for me. I may end up going back to WindowMaker, that I loved so much several years ago.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: 1.3em;">BTW, my MX1000 completely pwnz!</span></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: lloydr</div><div class="quote">If gnome 2.10 doesn't make massive improvements on gnome then I'm planning to go enlightenment or fluxbox</div><br /><br />You may not be happy about this, but Pat V / Slackware doesn't support Enlightenment either, from what I've read it's not in the current Slack 10.1 and won't be in 11 either. &nbsp;<br /><br />Just wanting to try out the competition I installed Slackware 10.1 with KDE last night and have a few issues to sort out, I was planning to run it for a week or so and see how it works for me compared to Gnome. <br /><br />First problem I hit was my atheros wifi card isn't support by either the 2.4 or 2.6 kernels in slackware, so I had to download the source for that and install it. &nbsp;Next problem I hit was my firewire hard drive wouldn't work in the 2.4 kernel, so I have to run their 2.6 to access it. &nbsp;And the final problem is the current nvidia driver (the only one that support my card so far) doesn't work in slackware's (or debian's) 2.6.10 kernel. &nbsp;So now I need to go back and revert to a 2.6.9 or maybe try a newer kernel if there is one. &nbsp;But at that point everything should work and I can start playing with KDE a little :)<br /><br />I figure after actually using kde for a week or so I'll be over the differences between it and gnome and maybe give it a fair shot instead of just saying &quot;This is different so it sucks&quot; after 5 minutes :)<br /><br />To continue being off topic : The upcoming version of Linspire is looking good and is pretty stable at this point but being they are using the Debian kernel which also doesn't support my video driver right now. &nbsp;So far my favorite distro the last 6 months or so has been Ubuntu. &nbsp;I've been tracking Hoary (sometimes get pushed more than 100 updates a day) but right now things are kind of flakey, hopefully things settle down as the final release date gets closer.<br /><br />Nick</div>
