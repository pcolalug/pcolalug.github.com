					Title: <b>New Reports of Apple switching to Intel</b><br />

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This rumor has been around for a long time, but CNN and the New York Times today ran a story from Reuters:<br /><br /><b>Apple Explores Use Of Intel Chips - Report</b><br /><i>By REUTERS <br />Published: May 23, 2005<br />Filed at 4:51 a.m. ET</i><br /><br />NEW YORK (Reuters) - Apple Computer Inc. has been in talks that could lead to a decision soon to use Intel Corp. chips in its Macintosh computer line, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.<br /><br />The report, citing two industry executives with knowledge of recent discussions between the companies, said Apple will agree to use Intel chips.<br /><br />Neither company would confirm the report and an Apple spokeswoman told the Journal she would characterize it as ``rumor and speculation.''<br /><br />It was unclear whether such a move would signal a large-scale shift away from chips made by IBM, Apple's longtime supplier, the report said.<br /><br />Apple could choose to add some Intel-based models to its product line or make a complete shift to Intel's chip technology in what would be seen as a serious blow to IBM's microprocessor business, the newspaper said.<br /><br />Adopting Intel chips would help ensure that future Macintosh systems could meet the price and performance of products from tough rivals such as Dell Inc. .<br /><br />Apple's pricing, which has often been higher than rivals, could become more competitive if Intel provides the kind of marketing subsidies it has given to other computer makers, the newspaper said.<br /><br />Apple sells only about three million computers a year -- a small portion of the estimated 200 million sold globally.<br /><br />But for Intel, winning over Apple would be a prestigious endorsement from one of technology's most influential trend-setters and could associate the chipmaker with Apple's hugely popular iPod music player.<br /><br />Apple's shares have nearly quadrupled since the iPod was introduced in October 2001. <br /><br /><br />Nick</div>
