					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve been on Windows all my life.&nbsp; Well, the majority of it anyways.&nbsp; My first computer experience was on our old Magitronic we got around &#039;93 with DOS and Windows 3.11 where I&#039;d play games and once in a very blue moon get online.&nbsp; When we upgraded to Windows 95, I didn&#039;t really like it but I eventually accepted it.&nbsp; I hated the computers at school because there was no right-click and they were more fancy than efficient.&nbsp; I later came to despise these Apple computers.&nbsp; In &#039;98, we got a Dell Pentium 2 with Windows 98.&nbsp; A great computer at the time.&nbsp; &nbsp;My mother still uses it.&nbsp; I was on this computer until 2006, when in late April, my parents bought me and my sister, who was going to college, laptops.&nbsp; I have a Dell Inspiron E1505 with 1 gig of Ram, a 100*gb HD, and an Intel Centrino Duo processor at 1.87 GHz.<br /><br />When I got my laptop I was finally able to do things I couldn&#039;t have done before on the &quot;family computer&quot;.&nbsp; One of which is to toy around with Linux.&nbsp; My first linux experience was with the Live CD of Ubuntu 6.&nbsp; It was okay, but I didn&#039;t install it.&nbsp; I was trying to get a friend with a fairly old computer of his own to install linux to replace his Windows 98SE which was riddled with viruses and spyware.&nbsp; Eventually his computer broke and he gave me some of its componenets, which I put in a new computer, along with Freespire, another friend and I gave him.<br /><br />That Christmas he got a laptop and hasn&#039;t used the computer we gave him, even though all the files on his old HDD such as IM logs and word documents are on it.<br /><br />At school I joined a TV Production class for an elective and all the editing was done on an iMac.&nbsp; I hated it just as much as I hated the macs from my elementary school.&nbsp; Since we rarely used the computers to do editing, most of their time was devoted to surfing the web, so I decided to find a way to get linux on their in a similar fashion to the Live CD.&nbsp; I then made a bootable USB drive to boot DSL.&nbsp; It was okay, but had issues getting online.&nbsp; I then tried a larger distro, SLAX.&nbsp; It worked fine and gave me way more potential than the Novell Zenworks client at my school gave me (I could download files for instance).&nbsp; As I showed this to a friend of mine, some girl came up and saw the Linux boot screen and said &quot;Ooooh!&nbsp; You&#039;re hacking!!&quot;&nbsp; It was quite funny.&nbsp; It was at this moment I realised that I was a computer nerd because I laughed at how she used &quot;hacking&quot; in it&#039;s correct sense to me, but in her definition (hollywood&#039;s definition), she was completely wrong.<br /><br />Nearly a year after I got my laptop I finally installed PCLinuxOS 2007 and in the process of partitioning rewrote my MBR and was locked out of windows for days.&nbsp; But, I had some help from a member of this forum who encouraged me to join.&nbsp; So, if you&#039;re reading this, thanks again for the help.&nbsp; What won me over with PCLOS was the ease of use and integrated 3D Beryl support.&nbsp; However, I felt that overall it was lacking.&nbsp; So, after a month of research I finally installed openSUSE 10.2, which I now dual boot with Windows XP Pro.<br /><br />My last linux venture was with my trusty USB drive, which I put Knoppix on.&nbsp; This Knoppix can boot with the Beryl desktop, which is really cool in my opinion.&nbsp; So, I always have a full 3D operating system wherever I go now.<br /><br />So, that&#039;s pretty much my story.&nbsp; I know that by comparison to many of you guys on the forum I am still a meager peasant rolling around in the golden mud that is the noobville for linux users, and I pray that thou hath mercy upon me when I inquire upon trivial subjects such as binary compiling and audio driver issues.</div>
