					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It&#039;s time again to nominate Steering Committee members for the coming year.&nbsp; Please post your nominations in this thread.&nbsp; Be sure to include name (and/or forum name) and the position you wish to nominate this person for.&nbsp; If you have multiple nominations, please include them in a single post.&nbsp; If you wish to nominate yourself for any position, feel free to!<br /><br />The Steering Committee is a core group of LUG members who are responsible for the day-to-day running of P&#039;cola LUG. The positions are:<br /><br />1. President - responsible for inter-organizational contacts, organizing events, and presides over meetings.&nbsp; Incumbent:&nbsp; Ian Barr (me)<br /><br />2. Vice President - primary assistant to the President and responsible for President&#039;s duties, should the President be unavailable.&nbsp; &nbsp;Incumbent:&nbsp; <br /><br />3. Secretary - responsible for intra-organizational communication, posting meeting notes, summaries, and announcements. Also responsible for forwarding/replying to email sent to info@pcolalug.org.&nbsp; &nbsp;Incumbent:&nbsp; <br /><br />4. Librarian - responsible for the P&#039;cola LUG library administration, &quot;review book&quot; ordering and distribution, and primary contact for O&#039;Reilly.&nbsp; Incumbent:&nbsp; Brett Hoff (bhoff)<br /><br />Two other positions - Webmaster and SysAdmin - are also part of the Steering Committee and are appointed by same.

We will vote as a group at the September meeting.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I second danc&#039;s nomination for dpeach for the positions of VP and Librarian. And, furthermore, I accept.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know that I can do justice as the President since I will probably miss half the meetings (I should be at the Sept meeting though). Secretary would be hard without actually being there.<br /><br />I guess I can accept Librabrian since we are keeping the books at the meeting location. I can work with our book supplier and our members through email.<br /><br />Basically I just want to get back on the Steering Committee and be part of the super secret behind the scenes discussion of things.<br /><br />I nominate danc for President, VP, Secretary and SysAdmin.</div>

Johnson here:<br />&quot;I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President.&quot;<br /><br />Of course, Johnson was paraphrasing the original statement on this matter, made by the famous Civil War veteran, General William Tecumseh Sherman, who said:<br />&quot;If drafted, I will not run; if nominated, I will not accept; if elected, I will not serve.&quot;<br /><br />That pretty well sums up my position.&nbsp; Thanks for the nod, though.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, OK, it&#039;s now 5 days before the &quot;election&quot;, and we have a nominee for VP and Librarian (sort of).&nbsp; Nobody for President, or Secretary.&nbsp; One person has yet to bother answering his nomination, either yes or no.<br /><br />Where are all you people who were screaming at me a month or so ago, calling me names, and throwing up all your ideas for improvement?&nbsp; How come none of you have volunteered, or even chimed in with an opinion?&nbsp; How come it&#039;s gone completely silent again (including in the new IRC channel)?<br /><br />What is going to happen (in 5 days), if there is no nominee for President?&nbsp; Will the current President continue, or step down and leave the LUG with nobody in charge?&nbsp; What&#039;s the plan?&nbsp; Who&#039;s gonna step up and do something?<br /><br />Dan<br /><br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If we have a position that needs to be filled and no one wants it, then I can fill one. Since I&#039;m the new guy, I certainly don&#039;t want to take a position that someone wants since I&#039;m still trying to get to know everyone and see what it&#039;s all about. As long as someone doesn&#039;t ask me to tinker into Linux too much since I know just enough to get myself in trouble. <br /><br />Mike</div>

You have done nothing but belittle the president at a personal level and generally have single handedly wrecked the effort to fix the lug. Now nobody wants to step up now. How can Ian fix things with no help. You made the comment that the &quot;Pensacola Linux Users Group&quot; is for &quot;Pensacola&quot; and set back and spout off about all the good things you say you have done in the past. The lug cannot benefit&nbsp; from that now. It needs help NOW so get off you pedestal and put in to help. You can help two ways. Either become involved or become uninvolved (shutup and go away). Knowing what/who you are, come on bring the comments to defend your actions and belittle me and the lug. Thats your style.</div>

I know the books are housed at the meeting place, but we need someone who is responsible for knowing who takes books and for ordering the books from O&#039;Reilly.<br /><br />I said it at the meeting: I accept any and all nominations. Put me back on the Steering Committee! I don&#039;t care what position. I will be accessible for the next year. I may miss a meeting here or there, but I want to be involved again.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ed, I thank you for the nomination but right now I feel it would be unfair to the group as I am in the middle of getting my certs for teaching and that is eating a lot of my time and flying back and fourth to houston with my consulting company. I will be there to help as much as possible and would really like to see some fresh haces come forward to join the sterring committe you do not have to know anything about linux to do it....Just try to expand the lug and get peolpe organized.</div>

I know it is rather late to be responding to this, but surely you are joking.<br />I&#039;m a newcomer who hasn&#039;t been very heavily involved, and I wouldn&#039;t be able to devote the necessary time online or offline to the duties of the office.<br />Therefore, though the election is already over, I&#039;ll say what I would have said before the election:<br />I decline the nomination.</div>
