					Title: <b>Review of Essential ActionScript 3 Colin Moock</b><br />

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Essential ActionScript 3 is a great book.&nbsp; It covers similar material to Essential ActionScript 2, but the author has done a great job fine tuning the coverage of the subject with the new AS3 version.&nbsp; The book gives a clear explanation of AS3 in a format someone with a coding background can relate too.&nbsp; With this book, the free Flex compiler, and an image editor, a person is ready to start working with Flash/Flex, with or without the Adobe/OSFlash tools.&nbsp; It will not be as helpful to someone without a solid coding background that was looking for a more visual explanation of the subject matter.&nbsp; Since the previous AS2 book, Mr. Moock has focused and refined the message in his excellent ActionScipt reference and tutorial.&nbsp; This book helps explain the dramatic advances in the ActionScript language.&nbsp; &nbsp;ActionScript is no longer a toy language in any fashion.<br /><br />The book excels at the nuts and bolts of the ActionScript 3 programming language and syntax.&nbsp; It does the best job explaining all of this that I have seen.&nbsp; It is definitely more clear to a newcomer to AS3 than Adobe&#039;s Online Documentation.&nbsp; The most useful part of the book was the clear explanation of the Display API.&nbsp; The online documentation of this is decent, but inadequate to easily learn the Display API if you are a novice.&nbsp; The information on the Display API is worth the price of admission alone.&nbsp; It has a great intro to the Event process.&nbsp; This is the best explanation I have seen of the Event process, it just makes sense after reading this book, from mouse/keyboard interactivity to program generated events, to I/O events. The explanation of the basics of Bitmap and Vector graphics is well done.&nbsp; It is not all you need to know, but it teaches you enough to get you started on the right path.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, each of the footprint tips in the book is a little gem. <br /><br />Seeing as AS3 is a major revision to AS2, if not a new language with an old name, you need to forget alot of the old syntax from AS2.&nbsp; Likewise, if all you have seen is AS2 and dynamic languages such as Perl/Python/PHP etc, all the new static and variable terminology is cumbersome at first ( perhaps it is obvious to someone familliar with Java).<br />All the basic syntax are explained cleanly: objects, functions, syntax, the scrapping old _root and _level syntax, differences between static and dynamic typing, etc..&nbsp; I found the explanations crystal clear.&nbsp; After reading this book, the pros and cons and uses of the static and dynamic objects will be clear.&nbsp; This was particularly tricky to follow in the Online docs.<br /><br />The cons are understandable shortcomings to keep the book under a thousand pages.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t cover the environmental details in any depth, be it the Flash tool, the Flex tool, the Flex compiler or other open source toolkits.&nbsp; This is also a feature, since it is tool agnostic.&nbsp; Like the other books by Mr. Moock, it doesn&#039;t cover the audio and visual end of ActionScripting in a great deal of depth.&nbsp; It would be nice to see more coverage in this area, but then again, the book would bulge way beyond a thousand pages.&nbsp; The biggest criticism is the explanation of sound is lacking, and IMO the book would be improved significantly with a good section on sound.&nbsp; It&#039;s not really covered, and there is not alot of easily found reference material on sound online.<br /><br />Unlike older versions of Flash, it is difficult to use AS3 without seeing the big picture.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t lend itself to learning a little at a time from scratch like older versions of AS.&nbsp; This book is a great primary reference and textbook for the ActionScript side of the Flash/Flex world.&nbsp; It is a buffet of useful factoids and tips on ActionScript 3!&nbsp; Using Google, the Adobe online docs and this book will be a solid foundation for learning ActionScript 3.&nbsp; It goes without saying that Adobe has been making huge advances with the entire Flex/Flash stack, and that it is well worth learning more about.<br /><br />Sam Feltus<br />http://samfeltus.com</div>
