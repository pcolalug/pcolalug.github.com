					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've gone through the first 100 pages of this book today. &nbsp;This book is slow going, just learned how to set the graphics mode, load a bitmap, and display it on the screen. &nbsp;Lots of introductory stuff about the game industry, discussion about Linux, the programming tools, compilers, debuggers, text editors, etc.<br /><br />Game Programming was the reason I got into programming (and was my whole motivation for going to college, to get a job as a game programmer). &nbsp;Done a few lame games in the past as school / hobby projects, so I'll definitely finish this book and try out the tools / techniques offered. &nbsp;<br /><br />My favorite game toolkit in linux is Allegro http://alleg.sourceforge.net. &nbsp;This book touts SDL (Simple DirectMedia Library) which is much more low-level, but not too hard.<br /><br />I'll post a better review when I finish it. &nbsp;Anybody know a graphics designer that could draw me some artwork for a game project when I get done? &nbsp;<br /><br />Nick</div>

All in all, though, I thought it's a good intro to the basic development tools available in Linux. I especially appreciated the debugger information, as this hasn't always been my strong point.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: imnes</div><div class="quote">Game Programming was the reason I got into programming (and was my whole motivation for going to college, to get a job as a game programmer). &nbsp;Done a few lame games in the past as school / hobby projects, so I'll definitely finish this book and try out the tools / techniques offered. </div><br />Me too, sorta. I got into computers because of gaming, though I don't hold high hopes of breaking into the industry. I've toyed with mods and such, though. &nbsp;Its hella fun.

For game engines, I've been looking at Torque by Garage Games (http://www.garagegames.com) ($100 per license, per developer, not too bad) and the Nebula Device from Radeon Labs (http://www.radonlabs.de/) (free). It'd be cool to build the engine from scratch, but John Carmak, I aint! 8)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: imnes</div><div class="quote">I'll post a better review when I finish it. &nbsp;Anybody know a graphics designer that could draw me some artwork for a game project when I get done?</div><br />I'm almost done with it, if you want to collaborate.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Imnes, there was a young man (aren't most of us young?) that came to a meeting with erc (Ed Carp) a while back. He is a graphics man.<br /><br />I forget his name, but I think he was big into game development as well. <br /><br />erc, if you are in, can we get a reminder of who he was?<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey, I am all for making some games, too. I was programming some before I went to college, but programming games was certainly the biggest reason I went into CIS. If you guys get something started I'd love to lend a hand if possible.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Doesn't really matter what they develop on, if you can code a windows game, you can code a linux game. &nbsp;Seems like most people aren't having to do much low level coding anymore anyway. &nbsp;A few companies release game engines, everyone else licenses them and build their games off existing code.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You know.... &nbsp;I'm tired of having to use Windows to play Half-Life and Counter Strike. &nbsp;You have to because the old versions of Half-Life are no longer useable because Valve Software released the Steam client and made that the only way to play CS and HL. &nbsp;I'm tempted to try to port it.</div>
