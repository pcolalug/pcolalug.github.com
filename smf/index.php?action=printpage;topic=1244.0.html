					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have been asked by a friend to network three windows computers and possibly set up a server where one of the computers is at. The computers will need to connect over the internet, they are in Brewton, Crestview and Fort Walton. If I set up the server it will be mandrake with samba. I guess a virtual private network is called for but I have not experience with them and I am not a computer man by trade and need advise on how to proceed with this. Any and all suggestion will be greatly appreciated. Ed</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Is it just 3 computers in each location? &nbsp;What kind of connection does each have to the Internet? &nbsp;What kind of server does he want at one of the locations?<br /><br />J</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ed,<br /><br />I don't know if you guys got this resolved our just put it on the back burner, but I just got done setting up a VPN with a friend across town. Using my Linksys WRT54G (http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?grid=33&scid=35&prid=601) and a firmware (http://ftp://ftp.sveasoft.com/pub/Satori_v2_2.00.8.7sv-pre1.bin.zip) from Sveasoft (http://www.sveasoft.com/), I was able to make a PPTP server. At his house, he has setup VPN connections on his Windows machines to &quot;dial in&quot; to my server and his systems are now part of the VPN. It was very easy to setup. As soon as I get my domain controller setup, we'll be sharing a domain for authentication. Supposedly, the next version of the firmware hopes to have IPSec included, so we will move to that as soon as it becomes available.<br /><br />If you would like further details, the Sveasoft forums (http://www.sveasoft.com/modules/phpBB2/index.php) helped me out a lot, or PM me and I would be more than happy to give you a call and lend any assistance I can.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you aren't comfortable doing the Linksys hack, the do sell VPN Gateways for about twice the price. &nbsp;IPSEC is more secure than PPTP; however, PPTP &nbsp;should be fine and probably easier to set up for this case.<br /><br />Scott<br />sstancil+lug@geekrooms.com</div>
