					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I guess if you want raw speed you can always use fvwm :) &nbsp;The idea is to get all this stuff working through hardware acceleration so there's not much extra load on the system (let the nvidia do all the processing). &nbsp;I welcome eye-candy so it's good for me :)<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok since a few sites leaked screenshots recently I guess it's okay to post. &nbsp;New Linspire has some eye-candy going on, drop shadows are working ok now (still kind of glitchy sometimes but overall it's working). &nbsp;<br /><br />(http://www.cs.uwf.edu/~nsmith/linspire/5.0/shots/lin-5.0.6-001_t.jpg)<br />Click for the full-size version (1600x1200) (http://www.cs.uwf.edu/~nsmith/linspire/5.0/shots/lin-5.0.6-001.png)<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">hi there,<br /><br />if the autodetect soundcard does not see my card, are there any other resources available to find drivers for it for linux? driversguide.com type sites for linux, or no? &nbsp;the card worked in the microsoft env.<br /><br />thanks!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would just get the model number of your soundcard or chipset if it is an onboard deal and do a search in google with linux at the end. You should be able to find <i>something</i></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">One quick way I look for hardware drivers is to boot up Knoppix. (http://www.knoppix.org/) That is a live CD with very good hardware detection. I don't guarantee it will work, but it is a good start. After booting that up, you see if your soundcard works. If it does, determine which driver it is using and all the information you can gather on it. Now go back to your Linux that you are having issues with and try to get the driver Knoppix was using to work for you.<br /><br />By Live CD, I mean a distro that does not have to be installed on the hard drive. It runs from the CD and RAM. So nothing gets installed/damaged from your current install.<br /><br />The Spinich Alfredo link did not damage my Firefox experience.</div>

Yes, I ran their version of &quot;Automatic Updates&quot; (Up2Date) and upgraded the Firefox RPM to the latest ver. Bingo, no more winkouts. All flash movies and other sites loadup fine now. Still working on getting media to play (audio/movies), maybe getting an updated video driver for this ATI card so I can increase resolution beyond 800x600, get that audio card going, loading j2re so I can run Limewire, etc. It's been very interesting so far! :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'd seen somewhere that there are some &quot;Firefox tweaks&quot;.. anyone remember or seen a link for this?<br /><br />For some reason, when I click a link to open a second browser, Firefox just sits there. Don't &nbsp;know any cli tcpip commands yet, so I'd just goto the NIC GUI configurator, and basically &quot;disable/enable&quot; the NIC, and then I'd be rolling again. For some reason, I keep dropping/regaining connectivity. My GAIM drops, then I have to relogin. &nbsp;I loaded up all the binds and DNS/Network management tools that the Up2Date installer showed as available, and get no errors @ bootup. My network config tool always shows that everything is fine w. the NIC, just keep dropping connectivity every once in a while.<br /><br />I'm on Cox HSI.</div>
