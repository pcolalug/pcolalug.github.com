					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Where to start...<br /><br />I started using Linux around '98 or so. &nbsp;My first experience was Red Hat. &nbsp;Went that direction due to being fed up with the high price of M$ and the lack of stability. &nbsp;I once spent a week trying to install Win98SE on machine after I wiped the hard drive of...Win98SE! &nbsp;Not to mention the user manual seemed to get less and less with each new release. &nbsp;I have tried Linux Mandrake, Slackware, and Fedora. &nbsp;<br /><br />Oddly enough the Unix I spent the most time with is FreeBSD. &nbsp;I really liked that one. &nbsp;Was with the Beastie for ~3 years. &nbsp;Then I needed something that just worked out of the box due to demands on my time. &nbsp;I also needed something that wouldn't scare my wife away. &nbsp;So I am now on Mandrake 10. &nbsp;I was shocked at how much it configures for you out of the box. &nbsp;Very impressed how far Linux has come since I went to the beasite.<br /><br />Currently I am attending graduate school after a ten year stint in the Navy. &nbsp;One of the older students and the only one with two kids. &nbsp;Been here for two years. &nbsp;Currently I am in the process of getting ready for my Ph.D. qualifying exam. &nbsp;Either pass that one or get a real job. &nbsp;So not a lot of free time for me. &nbsp;Whatever the outcome I am glad I came to school here.<br /><br />I use Linux at work and at home. &nbsp;I like the idea that I don't touch a windows machine for very long periods of time. &nbsp;I actually have a hard time using one now. &nbsp;I bet that sounds strange to most people. &nbsp;Why do people who know I use Linux think I can help them with their Windows problems?<br /><br />I am in the process of taking a crash course in C for a programming project at the university. &nbsp;I have programmed in C++, and &nbsp;MS BASIC. &nbsp;I do real basic web pages with HTML. &nbsp;By basic I mean it will render well in a text mode browser. &nbsp;Old fashioned? &nbsp;Most of the time I just use linux for desktop type stuff...mp3's, web browsing, e-mail, etc. &nbsp;At work it is programming, data manipulation, LaTex, etc. &nbsp;I work in the physics group. &nbsp;We use a large amount of custom software for our needs, and we do some serious number crunching.<br /><br />Not sure if I will ever make a meeting due to the drive. &nbsp;However, you never know. &nbsp;It would be nice to not be the only linux guy in the room for a change.<br /><br />Wow I can't believe I wrote this much!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome to our growing Linux community on the Gulf Coast!<br /><br />By the way, what is the computing community like in Tally?<br /><br />I can understand why peeps who know you use Linux think that you automatically know how to support their Winxx needs. I think there is a overall feeling that Linux users are a more advanced or evolutionized animal when it comes to computing.. as in they've graduated from using a broadsword to using a scalpel. :)<br /><br />Again, welcome aboard!<br /><br />Respectfully,</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome! Glad to see some folks from Tally. I know a couple of Linux users out that way, but no groups that I know of... Oh, well, you folks can always drive out here when you get the spare 3 hours! ;)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">By the way, what is the computing community like in Tally?<br /></div><br /><br />The only computing community I have found here that are active are the gamers. &nbsp;Of course 99% of the them are the M$ crowd. &nbsp;So we don't do the same language. &nbsp;I don't have time for games. &nbsp;Some days after work I don't want to use the computer. :shock:<br /><br />I can say at the university here is a pretty good group of guys who really like the linux OS. &nbsp;Haven't found anything organized as of yet. &nbsp;I guess that is an opportunity for someone like myself to organize something. Not sure how much work that will be though. &nbsp;Maybe after my status becomes a little more stable...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Perhaps, as the group is spread out ever wider, the LUG would consider some sort of opensource webcast or real time streaming presentation app (do they exist?), so that others could get the virtual experience of being @ a PLUG? Not sure about the bandwidth issues from site to streaming server to web, but could be an interesting project?<br /><br />Regards,</div>
