					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok, my third card in several months and still no joy. Wireless in Linux is THE SUX!!!! Anyway, do any of you have any decent wireless reference sites for Linux? I'm coming up dry at the moment. My current card is a Proxim 8470-WD b/g card (Atheros chipset, I believe). I can get it to come up, kind of, using the mad-wifi drivers, but it refuses to see my ap (which is wide open at the moment - I dread takling the WPA issue). Oh, I'm also open to distros that can use this card (not married to Gentoo or anything...).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm not sure how dated this is now, but have you seen Wireless configuration and startup - The Gentoo way (http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=122435)? I used that with my Netgear WG511 and I got stuff working. I was quite happy. I have to say, Ubuntu was extremely easy for setting up that NIC as well.<br /><br />When you say it doesn't see your AP, are you broadcasting your SSID? It could be that it isn't broadcast and you have to tell it your SSID and no WEP/WPA.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Wow, I haven't had any wifi issues in linux yet, maybe I'm just lucky. &nbsp;<br /><br />I'd suggest trying Linspire, I've been using it on the laptop and &nbsp;I've had no problems with my wifi.<br /><br />If you have flash player:<br /><br />http://media.linspire.com/howto/kiosk.swf<br />The top left says &quot;About Linspire&quot;, click that and switch it to &quot;Linspire Tutorials&quot;. &nbsp;Then when it shows the new menu, pick &quot;Wireless Networking&quot;.<br /><br />Don't get freaked out by the mixture of Linspire and Lindows names in the tutorial - they still haven't finished changing everything over ;)<br /><br />If not:<br /><br />In Linspire once you get it booted into X, check the L Menu (start menu) -&gt; Settings -&gt; Control Panel <br /><br />In the control panel, click on the Network -&gt; Network Connection tabs, then you can setup your wifi settings, security, interfaces etc. &nbsp;Make sure to check 'enable' for your wireless card.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">One of the big imrovements boasted about in SuSE 9.2 is it's Wireless support. I know, it's not available for download yet and as of this morning, still isn't on the shelves at BestBuy, but just something to keep in mind.<br /><br />The other big imrovement is in Laptop support. According to the reviews, they've sone an awsome job battery saving and hibernate modes.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I hate to hear about your problems with wireless. I had problems in the past, but recently with a Linksys card found that Mandrake worked well for it.<br /><br />I have been pretty aggressive at taking care of my future wireless problems before they start. I solve this by installing wires in all my rooms and plug in.<br /><br />I am one who believes that wireless is not ready for the masses. I don't even like cell phones. My application of wireless technology has been a little different than most people, but it has hopelessly failed me too often in the past. DOWN WITH WIRELESS!!! <br /><br />On a side note, I have been extreamly pleased with cell phone technology and coverage here in Mexico, and that is no joke. I would take their system here over anything we currently have in the States.<br /><br />But, I digress, this was supposed to be about Wi-Fi and computers.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for the replies. I thought about Linspire for this laptop. If anybody has and would like to shoot me that liveCD, I'd appreciate it.<br /><br />Anyway, I have the AP broadcasting the SSID, all the WEP/WPA stuff turned off (I'll be looking out my windows often, so don't be hogging too much of my bandwidth, now...). The card won't see the AP even if I manually tell it the SSID. Won't show up on a scan, either. Kills me because I was at this point with the first card (netgear) before giving it to a friend for a graduation present (thought the card wasn't supported at all, turns out to use the same chipset as the one I have now...). On the chipset note, be advised that though this card says Orinoco on it, its the Atheros chipset like the netgear. [edit]Darn you, Proxim. Darn[/edit] you straight to hell...<br /><br />Thanks for the link, bro. I forgot about that forum topic. Will let you know how it goes.<br /><br />[moderated 2:33PM CST 12/21/2004 by Rugmonster due to profanity in body]</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Success!!!!!<br />I E-Bayed an Orinoco Wifi (802.11b) card. &nbsp;It is a Lucent card re-branded by Cabletron. &nbsp;Shipping &amp; handling came to a total of $32.99.<br />It is connected to my home network via a Linksys WAP-11 (802.11b wireless access point).<br /><br />Lessons learned: &nbsp;<br />1. &nbsp;I normally run my access points with 128 bit encryption. &nbsp;This older card only supports 40-bit encryption, so I had to select 40/64 bit encryption on my access point. &nbsp;<br />2. &nbsp;Linspire correctly identified the card, but the Control Panel software does not expose all of the significant configuration elements needed. &nbsp; Recommend that you use the control panel to set channel number and to set the mode to AD HOC rather than using the &quot;Automatic&quot; options.<br />3. &nbsp;Using iwconfig in a console window, I had to manually set the RTS and FRAG parameters.<br />4. &nbsp;After having done all of the above, nothing worked until I rebooted--then everything lit up!!!!.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for all the input so far. We've run the LiveCD on the laptop over the holidays, and I have to say, Linspire is a really well put together distro. Didn't have the chance to check out the click-n-run stuff, but seems like that would be the icing on the cake. As expected, though, it did not recognise the card. The frustrating thing is that I can get the card recognized and blinking in Gentoo using the madwifi drivers; I just can't get the blasted thing to see the AP. I don't know how the settings (beyond ESSID and CHANNEL) work enough to start futzing with it at this point. The next steps are:<br /><br />1. more research &nbsp;](*,) <br />2. get someone more AP savvy than myself to check my AP settings<br />3. Try the newest SuSE LiveCD, whenever I can get that...<br />4. Fsck it and install XP on the laptop</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thought I'd add on my recent experiences in the Wireless Wars...<br /><br />I decided to give myself an early Christmas present, and go wireless on the laptop. &nbsp;My wife approved of this mainly because it would mean I no longer would have the Cat-5 cable running down the hallway into the living room where I like to use the laptop... &nbsp;Anyway, after a little research, I decided to go with the following hardware:<br />Linksys WRT54G wireless router/AP<br />Netgear WG511 NIC (pcmcia)<br /><br />Went over to Best Buy and got them both. &nbsp;Added the router to my existing LAN, acting just as an AP, and it worked just fine. &nbsp;So far so good...<br /><br />The WG511 uses the &quot;prism54&quot; driver, and so I went and got that, and installed it. &nbsp;There's a great website for this software at: &nbsp;http://www.prism54.org . &nbsp; OK...... after about 7 hours of fighting with it, and using the IRC channel #prism54 to great benefit, it was determined that this newest WG511 has a different chipset than previous WG511's, and wasn't supported. &nbsp;I was getting no lights or activity out of the NIC at all...<br /><br />Decided to try the Netgear WG511T model instead, so went back to Best Buy and exchanged for it. &nbsp;This card uses the Atheros chipset, and the &quot;madwifi&quot; driver. &nbsp;Installed that driver, plugged the NIC in, and EUREKA!!!! &nbsp;It worked the first try. &nbsp;I've now got WEP encryption working too, and am very pleased with how things are working.<br /><br />I'd recommend this wireless NIC for use with Linux. &nbsp;The &quot;madwifi&quot; driver software is very much &quot;beta&quot;, but seems to work flawlessly. &nbsp;Happy Holidays!<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I got everything working finally. Well, sort of. I also use the madwifi drivers and they seem to do the trick just fine, except I can't seem to get more than about 22Mb/s out of the thing. The interesting problem is that if I simply use iwconfig to configure the card (essid and channel; no WEP on the AP), I can't pull an ip. Now, and here's the wierd part, if I use kwifimanager and <i>turn on acoustic scanning</i>, things are hunkey-dorey. This means that we have to mute the sound on the laptop or risk being driven mad with all of the beeping. I haven't looked into this much yet, but I'll try and remember to keep you all posted.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">iwconfig ath0 rate<br />this will list your available rates.<br />If not where it should be you can try changing your rate with<br />iwpriv ath0 mode 3<br />then iwconfig ath0 rate again and see if they changed.<br />If not you may need to update your driver...<br />you can also visit there irc channel on freenode #madwifi</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks, bhoff. I'll give it a shot (though most of my sets listed in iwpriv don't work - operation not allowed).</div>
