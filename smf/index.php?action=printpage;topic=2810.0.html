					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sort of a dated article (Nov 2005), Tom&#039;s has another good article pitting dual core processors against dual single core processors. The results are interesting. Bottom line is that dual core, while exciting, is over priced considering the performance/dollar you get out of a comparable dual processor system. In most cases, the dual processor system beat out the dual core systems by a small margin, all the while coming in a much lower prices. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yes, but imagine two dual core processors on the same machine!&nbsp; Beast!&nbsp; (Though honestly, look at your avg cpu load next time you think you *really* need a better processor).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">There are very few times that I really feel like *I* need a new CPU. I have an Athlon64 3200+ (2.0Ghz). The only reason I would buy a faster CPU would be if I were buying a new video card. I don&#039;t really see the point in buying a new AGP video card, but if I were to upgrade my motherboard, then I wouldn&#039;t get one that supports PCI Express without getting a newer processor since the one I have now is a socket 754, no longer being used for newer processors. I may have to just go ahead and bite the bullet and realize that if I want to push this current system out, I may have to buy a video card sometime within a year to keep it from falling too far behind the times for gaming, and then in a couple more years really upgrade everything short of the case, powersupply, floppy and probably dvd-rom.<br /><br />Anyhow, back to the article... <br />I think if I were building a workstation system that was being used for development or really intense graphics or video editing, I would consider going dual processor. If I were thinking about building a heavy duty server that I needed to be able to scale up at a later date, I would consider a single dual core processor with the option to add another dual core processor later. As a desktop system, multiple processors don&#039;t make as much sense because most applications are not made to take advantage of multiple processing cores. Unless you have two or more CPU intensive applications running at the same time, you typically won&#039;t see any improvement. For the price a single dual core chip, you can buy a heck of a lot faster single core chip and really see a performance gain. <br /><br />Let&#039;s face it, about the only CPU intensive things we do as desktop users is game and games today just don&#039;t take advantage of any more than a single processor. That&#039;s why I laugh when people brag about having a dual core gaming rig...or better yet a dual chip dual core (4 cores total) gaming rig. While it may help when gaming some by having any OS overhead being taken care of by one processor, I think for the same money you spent on the dual core processor, you can get a faster single core processor that will handle everything faster. I say, if you&#039;re building a system where the most intensive thing you&#039;re going to be doing is gaming and you really have money to burn, take the money you would have otherwise spent on a dual core processor and get a better video card, more memory or a pair of 150GB RaptorX&#039;s. </div>

Seems like a waste to compile everything with &quot;uber optimizations&quot; when binary packages from other distros that are less &quot;optimized&quot; run nearly the same. I&#039;m a firm believer in getting the most return on investment and using Gentoo and compiling every from source just doesn&#039;t quite give me that...personally.<br /><br />The good news is that apparently Quake 4 can run in SMP mode, so if you really wanted to dig for a justification for running more than one processor (core) on a gaming system, you can throw that one out there. Since Enemy Territory: Quake Wars is going to be a modified Doom3 engine, we may see it supporting SMP as well.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I like the idea of dual dual cores for running SETI. But the Opterons are not cheap. I installed Quake4 on my dual Athlon and its not smp or for some reason it didn&#039;t install it that way, my Quake3 is smp. I think now with all of the dual cores out the game folks will need to write games to support smp.</div>
