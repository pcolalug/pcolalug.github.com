					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have used many different versions of slackware. &nbsp;Right now slackware is powering my router / web server. &nbsp;<br /><br />Seems to be a nice little distro. &nbsp;Weak package management though, I think they should adopt RPM which is sort of a de-facto standard now anyway. &nbsp;That would allow Ximian to release their desktop for it.<br /><br />Releases are very slow compared to other distros, expecially in the last two years. <br /><br />If you're used to the nice graphical installers of mdk / rh / suse you probably won't like slackware. &nbsp;The install is text based (ncurses) and not very user friendly. &nbsp;A little cumbersome. &nbsp;About like installing FreeBSD if you've ever tackled that. &nbsp;Definitely not for a beginner since you should know how to partition your drive with linux's fdisk.<br /><br />On the plus side it has a lot of nice tools for the console user (why I'm using it for my router). &nbsp;Nice utilities like NetWatch which other distros don't care to include. &nbsp;And a text editor called &quot;pico&quot; that a friend likes to use (if you ask me, you never need more than vi for quick editing jobs, and emacs for web browsing / authoring ;) ) &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />They also seem to be sort of a purist distro. &nbsp;They don't seem to molest things like KDE and GNOME as much as the others do &nbsp;That could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on what you like.<br /><br />If you know what you're doing, don't mind compiling your own apps from source, (and know how to customize the kernel, non-modular last time I checked) ,then you might just like it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Wow, such an old thread. &nbsp; Oh well, guess I'll add my $0.02 to it.<br /><br />Slackware, like I think I've stated before, is what I use simply because it's what I'm most comfortable with. &nbsp;The install is still quite a bit behind most (all?) other distros, but then again it's not geared towards the rh/mdk/suse crowd &nbsp;:o . &nbsp;<br /><br />Package management probably qualifies as the next thing that most people find uncomfortable about slack. &nbsp;In short, Slackware's package management is effectively lacking, so that puts it up there as a source-based distro. &nbsp;But since I feel better compiling things from source anyways, this again is a matter of choice.<br /><br />And as imnes said earlier, things such as gnome and kde are left unmolested. &nbsp;This creates a sterile-looking and rather unintuitive interface. &nbsp;Not that this isn't changeable, it's just something that makes slack extremely newbie-unfriendly (ie, those coming from a strictly doze-based world.)<br /><br />So is there a point to this post? Not really, just sharing my opinion. &nbsp;:D</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Of course all of this will change once some &quot;journalist&quot; whines about his/her inability to Read And Follow Directions (RAFD) and why aren't there pictures to look at during the Slack install. Then, you'll have a &quot;Slackware Desktop Group&quot; and a &quot;Slackware Freindly Cuddley Instally Wizzard Group&quot; and there will be nothing left for the geeks anymore.<br /><br />As for FreeBSD, I found the install process logical and intuitive. It *was* my first &quot;real&quot; OS install, and it went smoothly. Thanks to the great docs, I had done my first custom kernel by the end of the first day with no probems.</div>

I'm so used to /dev/hda for my hard drive, took me forever to figure it out in BSD. &nbsp;(Not even sure if I'm remembering this correctly, but I think my drive was /dev/asd0a or something).<br /><br />Nick</div>
