					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">A lot of DVDs are encrypted using CSS (not to be confused with Cascading Stylesheets). To view them on your computer, you need to download the libdvdcss package. It&#039;s not included in Debian or Ubuntu repositories, if memory serves me, because of copyright issues (various countries have differing laws on such things as fair use), but you can download it directly using this command at the command prompt:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">$&nbsp; wget http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/libdvdcss/1.2.9/deb/libdvdcss2_1.2.9-1_i386.deb</div>Since you&#039;re running Ubuntu, you can download the deb package. Other distros would get the tar.gz and compile from source. (There&#039;s an RPM package for RH users)<br />Then either become root and run:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">#&nbsp; dpkg -i /path_to_deb_file/libdvdcss2_1.2.9-1_i386.deb</div>or if your system was set up without root (common with Ubuntu):<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">$ sudo dpkg -i /path_to_deb_file/libdvdcss2_1.2.9-1_i386.deb</div>Making sure to change the path to wherever you were when you downloaded the deb file. If you run the sudo command in the same directory, you can omit the path portion, of course.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t want to waste your time with stuff I think you probably know, but if you need help on getting to a command line, just post a reply and one of us will walk through the steps.<br /><br />For burning CDs/DVDs, the standard seems to be the X CD Roaster. If you&#039;ve tried this and are having trouble, post the error messages you&#039;re getting.<br /><br />Watching commercial DVDs on your computer is fair use, but downloading unlicensed copyrighted material is, of course, illegal.<br /><br />As far as watching Flash(tm) files, I just use my browser and the flash plugin, so I don&#039;t know anything about playing them in a standalone media player.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The links? Links where? The links on the download.videolan.org site?<br />I&#039;m confused what you&#039;re trying to access that is taking you to Google.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Those are links but not like you normally use that whole string is a command you put in the terminal I was telling you about.<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">$&nbsp; wget http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/libdvdcss/1.2.9/deb/libdvdcss2_1.2.9-1_i386.deb</div>Here wget is a command line tool for downloading the required file . you also need to be root or sudo root however ubuntu does it.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yes. Exactly as bhoff said. The $ or # indicates what type of prompt is required for the command. # means you need to be root. $ is a command you should run as a normal user.</div>
