					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sorry for the lack of information.&nbsp; <br /><br />As for a Linux related job, I am honestly interested in any career related to Linux or other OS opportunities.&nbsp; I should have stated that I am originally from Fort Walton Beach, and yes, am interested in relocating back to the Panhandle.&nbsp; As for Linux related experience, I will admit that it is limited to what I have learned within labs within my curriculum, but I am very interested in it and always passionate about learning.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the campus doesn&#039;t offer much in the venue of job hunting outside of the Atlanta area.&nbsp; The other aspects they help with are honing resume skills and interview skills.<br /><br />Thank you for the information regarding the clearance.&nbsp; I have had a few people ask me about my clearance and they referred to it as inactive, saying it could be reinstated.&nbsp; I will make sure to state that correctly from now on.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thank you kindly for your reply, and once again, sorry for not being clear.</div>
