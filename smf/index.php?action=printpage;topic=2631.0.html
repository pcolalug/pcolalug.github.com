					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">i've bought a new laptop, a Toshiba Satellite P35. &nbsp;are there any good Linux-compatible printers you would suggest? &nbsp;i'll still be running Slackware on my laptop, or i might try the latest version of gnome or KDE since it's a lot faster than my old computer.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have an HP Deskjet 812C (really old). There were some models that they made that did not work with Linux. I think the whole 700 series of inkjets did not. But, now with USB, I *think* that just about everything HP is putting out works in Linux. I would not buy though without checking out the link mentioned above.<br /><br />For the record. I have had several laser printers. All of them worked flawlessly in Linux. Different brands and drivers. I have also plugged into several different lasers in my travels. I have yet to find one that did not work easily in Linux. That is not to say they are not out there, but I think it would be rare to find one. <br /><br />As far as a printer/scanner/copier/fax/coffee maker, I have to give warning. I bought an HP scanner about a year ago. Based on what I read *all* HP USB scanners work in Linux...except like 2. I bought one of those two. So if you go for an all-in-one, make sure all the features of it are supported in Linux.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">the one i'm looking at is the HP PSC1410. &nbsp;it's got everything in one, and it's not too expensive. &nbsp;i found the HP PSC1400 on the site. &nbsp;that's the closest i could get. &nbsp;i dunno if this is just another version of it or what. &nbsp;my guess is by what you say that it should work. &nbsp;still not gonna buy anything before my computer arrives and i check all this stuff out though.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Buy from a local store (Office Depot, Sams if you can) so you can return it easily should it not work...unless of course you find a killer deal on it.</div>
