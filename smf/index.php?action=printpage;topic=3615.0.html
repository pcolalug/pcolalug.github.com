I&#039;m a Python developer working for a division of the Salt Lake Government remotely out here. When I was living in Utah I was an openSUSE developer but now that I&#039;m away from Novell I&#039;ve switched to Debian based distros again (mix of Mint and Ubuntu).<br /><br />I use vim.</div>

I will be tied up from 6:30 to 8:30. Got commitments before and after church, but I can slip away from both for a minute. A lunch meeting at a local Pizza Hut, or the aforementioned Whataburger on Christmas Eve would would out better for me.<br /><br />Best thrift stores here are the Waterfront Mission stores. They have the best organization of their stuff. Salvation Army and Goodwill have not impressed me much here. Nothing has impressed me as much as the stores we found in Ogden and Salt Lake City. Those Mormons in Utah have a communal mentality. They like to help their fellow man and donate some really nice stuff to their thrift stores. My wife and I have visited thrift stores all over the US for 15 years. We consider ourselves connoisseurs of fine thrift stores everywhere. :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I&#039;m up for doing something Christmas Eve as well, whatever works for everyone else :)&nbsp; I just want to meet everyone and get my Linux on!<br /><br />Haha, you do know your thrift stores, I recently just got an interest in them because I was dating a girl from Ogden who showed me how magical it could be, and when we were out in Italy we went to the Milan street market on VIA PAPINIANO, which was just amazing, now I can&#039;t stop.<br /><br />But the people in Salt Lake/Utah do have a community mentality, it is so amazing, we had 5 Linux User Groups (SLC, Ogden, Provo, Ubuntu, and SUSE) all within 40 minutes of each other and then a bunch of programming user groups (Python, Perl, Java, Ruby, etc).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Aside from the stores David mentioned, we have a Habitat for Humanity ReStore and Pensacola Salvage for home improvement stuff. Also on Navy Blvd, there&#039;s a neat little shop called the Back in Time Thrift Store, I&#039;ve found good stuff there for Halloween costumes before, could probably easily find some ugly sweaters there! :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">What part of town works best? I am on the west side, but have a car and can go just about anywhere in Pcola for lunch. Pizza Hut? Whataburger? Will Pizza Hut be open Christmas Eve? I am sure Whataburger will be.<br /><br />Ugly sweater? I don&#039;t think I have any that really qualify and not sure I will make it to a thrift store between now and then, but I can probably scrounge up something.<br /><br />Trying to contact a couple of Old Timers in the group and see if they might come out of hiding for a quick lunch meetup.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ozone is my favorite pizza place in the Pensacola area, so I suggest them if we are looking to get pizza :)<br /><br />If they aren&#039;t open, diners always are, so we can get Village Inn, Waffle House, Dennys, etc.</div>
