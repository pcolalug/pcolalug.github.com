					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">2.6 still requires that you enable HIGHMEM with the 4gb setting<br /><br />HIGHMEM off is for &lt;1gb<br />HIGHMEM 4gb is for 1gb-4gb<br />HIGHMEM 64gb is for 4gb+</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">See, this is what I was so curious about when reading the descriptions in XConfig. &nbsp;If I remember right they say leave it off for up to 1GB, on for up to 4GB...it's one of those &quot;on the fence&quot; deals.<br /><br /><br />Well, I've got to rebuild anyway to enable I2C or else I won't be able to use tvtime properly (at least, I THINK it's tvtime...it's some program like that).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">There's nothing &quot;on the fence&quot; about it... &nbsp;If you have 1Gb of memory, you do not have *LESS THAN* 1Gb !!!<br /><br />Again, &quot;&lt;&quot; means &quot;less than&quot;...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Actually, the avatar is from a SNL skit parodying VH1's Behind the Music of The Blue Oyster Cult. That's Will Farrell playing the guy with the cowbell in Don't Fear the Reaper. It was a very funny skit and the phrase &quot;I need more cowbell&quot; because a common thing heard during my time at Baghdad.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Danc, last time I read about the highmem capability in Xconfig it said to leave it off if you've got up to 1GB. &nbsp;I've got 1GB, that'd be right &quot;up to&quot; 1GB. &nbsp;I don't have over 1GB, so I didn't see a reason to turn it on.<br /><br /><br />That's just the way I read it anyway but rest assured, I spend several hours reading absolutely everything about every feature when I do a kernel rebuild.</div>
