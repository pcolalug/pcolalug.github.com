					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">LOL. &nbsp; <br /><br />The last time I used solaris (musta been 8 or 9) &nbsp;Imho, in many things it lagged 4 years behind linux. &nbsp;Solaris vs Linux is no competition what so ever (except perhaps when were talking about sun hardware) &nbsp;<br /><br />I'm not familar with sun's OSS licence, but now that the source code is 'freely availible' what's to stop someone from porting either directly or indirectly the few good things solaris has going on the x86 hardware?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: Brent</div><div class="quote">...in many things it lagged 4 years behind linux.</div><br /><br />Just out of curiosity, what sort of things did it lag behind in?<br /><br />I find Solaris to be very intriguing. Many of the ways Linux does things comes from Solaris. Look at our SystemV style init scripts (save for Slackware's BSD style) and look at what all the different dev file systems are trying to be. Solaris has built in hardware autodetection, something the Linux has yet to really figure out and make standard. <br /><br />I'm not saying the Solaris is better than Linux or Linux is better than Solaris. I'm just saying this. Each one has its strengths and weaknesses depending on the situation. Use the right tool for the job. Isn't that what choice, which everyone in the F/OSS community screams about?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: Brent</div><div class="quote">...now that the source code is 'freely availible' what's to stop someone from porting either directly or indirectly the few good things solaris has going on the x86 hardware?</div><br /><br />Seeing as how the code base for Solaris is the same for x86 and Sparc, it doesn't make a difference. People can and will being porting stuff from Solaris to other operating systems. Sun has done that with stuff that is on Linux. They did away with lpadmin and now use CUPS/foomatic for printing in Solaris 10. The Java Desktop System is based off of Gnome. They did the same thing with OpenOffice.org. They still sell StarOffice, which is just OpenOffice.org with two added apps and some rebranding. Nothing says they can't and nothing says we can't take OO.o and do with it what we want.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Granted, UWF's Sun setup isn't the greatest, but they do <i>claim</i> to keep up to date. &nbsp;Lets see, They still use CDE as the desktop. &nbsp;All the unix util's they have on there are hopelessly out of date. &nbsp;The entire system is just plain clunky.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Solaris has built in hardware autodetection</div> uh, well yeah they <i>make</i> the hardware. &nbsp;Solaris was only really ported to x86, what last year? &nbsp;I doubt you'll have the availibility of drivers for the x86 hardware that is enjoyed by linux.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Out of date usually means stable. You don't just go for bleeding edge unless you absolutely need it when you are dealing with a production environment. Look how many people still use Redhat 7.3, or those still running the 2.2 kernel. OpenBSD doesn't stay on the leading edge. And Debian, known for being incredibly stable, lags behind several years from the latest versions of all of our favorite programs. While I will accept instability in some circumstances, such as on my desktop, when it comes to a production server or workstation that is going to be hammered, I'll take a few out of date packages if money is riding on it.<br /><br />Also, if there is a driver for you hardware, no matter x86 or sparc, a boot -r will find it. That is provided there is a driver. x86 support is relatively new, but they are moving into the x86 sector, especially with the new Opteron servers and Athlon64 workstations that are out there. Drivers are one thing, autoconfiguration is another.</div>
