					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, It looks like there's a change taking place on how web sites are getting you to read their Ads. Since Pop-up blockers seem to be abundant and work well, web sites are moving to forced Ads. This is where a site forces your web browser to display an Advertisment page for a period of time before forwarding it to the page you asked for. <br /><br />I'm sure there will be something devolped, if not already, to get around this. My question is, should we try to block this type of advertising? Are going to end up cutting off our nose to spite our face in the long run?<br /><br />Advertising is what keeps a lot of these web sites up and running and if the advertisers think they are fighting a losing battle, they may start pulling their Ads. When this happens, sites will no longer be able to foot the cost of hosting and may end up shutting down.<br /><br />Personally, I don't mind the new forced Ads. It is usually just one Ad and with todays broadband gives me a chance to take a drink of soda.:) Also, it's a lot less intrusive than 50 pop-ups playing in the background.<br /><br />So, what do you all think?<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, a really effective measure will be people avoiding sites with this feature when possible. Cramming ads down people's throats never won anyone business, IMHO, so this may hurt, rather than help.</div>

Cramming ads down people's throats never won anyone business, IMHO, so this may hurt, rather than help.</div><br /><br />I can understand that when it comes to pop-up advertising, as that is very annoying. However, if advertising went away, then how would web site owners/operators pay for bandwidth, servers, etc? Of course they could be advertising free and charge for access to their site, but I've never seen that work before. The other option is to be advertising free and ask for donations. Of course that normally ends up with enough donations to fund a dial-up connection for the hosting server which would end up running on a 386 computer with a 20MB hard drive and 32MB of memory.<br /><br />So, IMHO, advertising is a necessary evil. (It's kept televesion free for years) The industry needs to come up with a way of making the visitor look at the Ad without making it too anoying. If the Ad is just integrated into the page, most people will not even notice it. If the Ad pops up behind the page, people will close it without paying attention to it. If the Ad appears in your web browser while on the way to a page in the web site, you'll notice it without closing it. (This is exactly what commercials do on television and they've been proven to work without too much complaining)<br />So, given the option of sites going away because of no advertising or sites being avoided because of too much intrusive advertising, or sites including an (One) Ad between pages on a site, I'll take the later.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don't mind the occassionaly (non animated, and non-sound-playing) banner ad. &nbsp;But pop-up ads are definitely a waste of time. &nbsp;Especially those like geocities pages have (the ones that block the page and won't move until you've had a few seconds to see it).<br /><br />Also, why would advertisers quit using it just becuse people don't pay attention? &nbsp;I wish that were so, if it was I wouldn't receive 30+ spam messages in my go.com email box <b>daily</b>.<br /><br />I was toying with an idea the other day but haven't tried it yet. &nbsp;You can download host files maintained by various people on the web (they basically redirect advertisers url's to invalid addresses so pop-ups and ad banners don't work). &nbsp;Since my router also functions as my DNS server, can I put that hosts file on there and effectively block ads from all machines on my network? &nbsp;Just an idea. &nbsp;I'll let you know when I get around to trying it.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">As Steve mentioned, having an ad forced on me is not too bad if I have broadband. But when you are dealing with dialup, it is a pain. I don't like even sticking around for a page's &quot;flash&quot; intro to play. Most of the time I have broadband available, but not always.<br /><br />If the ads were basic and did not take more than a few seconds to load, I might not mind. But once started (I guess it already has, I just have not seen it) then where will the size of the ads stop?<br /><br />I hate to bring this on myself, but do you have a link to a page with this type of ad?<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Is it still working on CNN, or did I miss something. All I saw was the normal banners and such. BTW, what's wrong with banners anyway? I've actually clicked on a few on sites like Slashdot or OSDN. I have never responded to a pop-up or other such travesty.<br /><br />As an aside, a buddy of mine had an interesting thing happen a few months ago. Seems as he was surfing, someone figured out how to use Windows Messaging (the subsystem that tells you your print job is done and broadcast messages via Windows network) to broadcast spam to him and some other Win32 users he knows. This is particularly insideous, as if you turn this &quot;feature&quot; off in Win, you don't get some system messages from your OS!</div>

Comparing Banner Ads to this, I think this would get more attention. I know I pretty much ignore banner ads as I'm sure a lot more people do.<br /><br />You've got to be carefull on what people are calling the &quot;windows messaging pop-ups&quot; I've seen a few HTML pop-up ads that are coded so they look exactly like a Window messaging pop-up. In fact they are just an html window. The &quot;OK&quot; takes you to their web site 9 time out of 10. If your friends get this again, tell them to right-click on the message popup and see if they get a menu. If they get a menu when right-clicking then it is nothing more than a web page made to look like a windows pop-up message. Windows pop-up messages don't have a right-click menu.<br /><br />Steve</div>

Or at least that is what you hear. I am sure they work to a degree. Maybe advertisers have higher expectations than they should for banners. <br /><br />I personally just ignore them. I will do the same with the forced ads. But they may work on some people. To me it is like telemarketing, I don't buy a product or service because someone is trying to sell it to me. I buy because I puposefully intended to buy. I don't do my shopping based on banner ads. That is impulse buying and that is what gets people into debt. And I am theologically against that (and I just can't afford debt). Therfore banner ads don't work on me. But I am sure they work with many people, just not to the expectation of the advertisers.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I read up on the topic several months ago. &nbsp;The official word seems to be &nbsp;that plain-text ads that don't annoy the user, and that actually relate to the content on the page seem to do best. &nbsp;Like the plain-text ads that run along side of the search results on www.google.com. &nbsp;They seem to try to only show ads that match your search results which is nice, it makes sense if I'm looking up information on Qt programming, a quick link to a book about it on amazon.com is kinda nice.<br /><br />Nick</div>

The pop-ups: OK it was just a thought.<br />2. Ads: So what we seem to be saying is that for the 30 something years that commercials have been running on TV, they don't work. &nbsp;They don't normally relate to the show. They are very intrusive. However, I just can't believe that they don't work. Otherwise, the advertisers wouldn't have been doing it for so long. The Ads that I started this topic with work the exact same way television advertising works. When you click a link on a page, you get an advertisement page for a few seconds before it redirects you to the place you were trying to get to. TV is the same way. When you are watching a show, you get redirected to advertising every so often before returning to the rest of the show. People have learned to live with that and I think they will learn to live with the advertising on the net. My original point is that the redirected pages are the closest to what we get with television advertising. And, television advertising seem to be accepted by society as a whole.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, for me anyway, no, television ads don't work. I don't remember ever buying anything because of an ad of any kind in my adult life. Mostly its been because of word of mouth, reviews, personal research and the like. I think a lot of people have become desensitized to advertisements and sort of mentally filter them out most of the time.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">While I see banner Ads as comparable to Magazine Ads and the redirection Ads as comparable to TV commercials. Pop-up Ads are comparable to Telemarketers.<br /><br />Anyway, I do think TV commercials are affective in some respect. Ever watched a new car commercial? Don't the good ones stick in your mind? You need to remember that advertising, unlike word of mouth and research, is designed to be subliminal and covert. In other words, people say they don't watch commercials and the commercials don't influence their buying power yet how many people drink Pepsi or Coke rather than the less advertised sodas? Oh, you say you prefer Pepsi or Coke to the other stuff? When was the last time you tried ALL of the other stuff? When was the last time you checked the ingredients? They are all pretty close to the same. That's just one example and whoever is reading this may be the exception to that example. <br />The point is, whether we conciously pay attention to advertising or not, it does affect our buying decisions. The advertisers have a lot smarter people than you or me studying this and they wouldn't pump all of the big bucks into advertising if it didn't work on the &quot;majority&quot; of the population. Look at the price for 30 seconds of superbowl advertising. Are you saying that it doesn't work?<br />I personally believe that everyone's puchasing decisions are affected by advertising to some degree. Back to my example Coke and Pepsi wouldn't be so much larger and more well known than Shasta and Crown if it weren't for advertising. We may not realize how much it affects our decision to buy Dial over Irish Spring but it does. Anyone who's taken a course in psychology or studied advertising in college knows it works.<br /><br />Back to the original topic.. I think the advertisers are still trying to figure out what works best on the internet. It doesn't really matter whether we like it or not. What matters is what will influence the buying power of the consumer. So, in the end it may be the subtle banner ads or it may be the obtrusive pop-ups or something in between. We'll have to wait and see.<br /><br />Steve</div>

I say that as I sit here with my Nike ball cap on, and sipping on my coke, working on a computer wih an Intel processor, trying to get Windows running all while listening to my Sprint phone ring.<br /><br />OK, so advertising does effect me.<br /><br />I do agree that the balance must be between the banner and the pop-ups.
