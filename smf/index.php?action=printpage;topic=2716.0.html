					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey all,<br /><br />I signed up for classes today, and one of the classes that I&#039;ll be taking this spring is an ASP/dbase class.<br />(It was either that, or visual basic, (which I&#039;ll likely be forced to take anyway)).&nbsp; Just wanted to get an opinion form the code monkeys out there.&nbsp; Is this really a useful class?&nbsp; Given that I won&#039;t touch I.E. with a ten foot pole, I&#039;m not really entusiastic about learning to program in something that isn&#039;t cross platform (I find linux indespensable for coding)&nbsp; I at least hope this will be somewhat useful when I get out in the real world.<br /><br />Not that I&#039;m changing my class lineup either way, it&#039;s an online course muhahaha&nbsp; O0<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">ASP if it is ASP.net could be useful and in the right configs is cross-platform. Considering the vast use of Windows as a web server platform, ASP.net can be extremely useful depending on the job. Also, C# ASP.net pages can be used on *nix platforms with the use of Mono and there is an older product originally by Chilisoft and integrated into Sun&#039;s webserver for traditional ASP. All of the web apps and the majority of the standard apps that come from the programmers where I work are written in C# with MSSQL or Oracle backends. Soak it up because any experience is good experience.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you end up with Prayaga as the instructor, don&#039;t count on it. Granted it was 2002 when I took it, but I am pretty sure that as of last year it hadn&#039;t changed - and if ASP wasn&#039;t bad enough, you&#039;ll also be stuck having to use Frontpage to do it.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />Hopefully you&#039;ll end up with someone else that maybe has taken the time to update the material.<br /></div>
