					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">On my Mandrake machine I can boot the computer into my standard user without requiring a password. There is a password on the user, but it will do the initial boot without asking for it. If I log back out and try to log in, I have to supply the password. When I do XFDrake to make changes to my XF86Config file it asks me if I want to use this feature. Therefore, I assumed that it was something handled by XF86Config. But it is not, which I could have figured out based on the fact that simply restarting X does not allow to bypass the password, only restarting the whole machine.<br /><br />I am trying to do the same on my Gentoo system w/ KDE. I am supposed to be using kdm, though I don't know since I never have to manually start X. Is this something handled by kdm and how would I go about finding this?<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm looking at a redhat 9 derivative here and I see the kdmrc file in<br />/etc/kde/kdm<br /><br />If you look in the file, there are 'AutoLoginEnable' and 'AutoLoginUser' fields.<br />Was this what you meant by logging in automatically?<br /><br />Not sure if this helps - here's hoping.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ahh, once again. Right where I expected it:<br />/usr/kde/3.1/share/config/kdm/kdmrc<br /><br />I should have thought to look there first.<br /><br />But all rants aside, that did the trick. Thank you. I was able to find the answer on the Gentoo forums, but only after I knew what to look for. I appreciate the direction.</div>
