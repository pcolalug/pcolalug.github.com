It is a little late of an announcement, but maybe it will be a help to someone.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MELBOURNE LINUX USERS GROUP, INC.<br /><br />FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Contact: &nbsp;Anthony Awtrey<br />February 26, 2003 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(407) 999-9870<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Extreme Linux Comes To Central Florida<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Presentation by Linux International's Executive Director<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jon &quot;Maddog&quot; Hall and SGI<br /><br />ORLANDO, February 26, 2003 - The Melbourne Linux Users Group, Inc.<br />(MLUG) and the Orlando-based Linux Enthusiasts and Professionals of<br />Central Florida (LEAP) proudly announces that they have organized a<br />presentation on Extreme Linux by Jon &quot;Maddog&quot; Hall, Executive Director<br />of Linux International, and computer vendor SGI. &nbsp;The conference will<br />feature presentations by both Mr. Hall and representatives from SGI<br />on using the Linux operating system with the most powerful computers<br />available today. The event is being held Friday, March 7th 2003 at the<br />Hilton Garden Inn in Orlando, FL from 7:00pm until 10:00pm.<br /><br /><br />Mr. Hall, who has worked for companies like Digital Equipment<br />Corporation, Compaq and HP, has been an advocate of Linux since 1994. As<br />Executive Director of Linux International (http://www.li.org/), he has<br />worked with computer vendors and companies to understand how Linux and<br />Open Source software benefit the market. &quot;I'm looking forward to the<br />event,&quot; said Hall. &nbsp;&quot;Linux continues to grow in its capabilities and<br />more companies are recognizing the power of Open Source software.&quot;<br /><br />Andrew Fenselau, Product Manager, and Carlos Rojas, Senior Systems<br />Engineer, will represent SGI (http://www.sgi.com). &nbsp;They will be<br />providing a presentation and detailed information about the Linux<br />OS-powered family of servers and superclusters called the SGI(r)<br />Altix(tm) 3000, with up to 64 processors in a single image. &quot;Altix 3000<br />is the most powerful, single image computer running Linux today,&quot; said<br />Fenselau. &quot;We are seeing a tremendous amount of interest in this product<br />and have already gotten sales commitments for dozens of systems.&quot;<br /><br />Linux and Free / Open Source software has gained prominence as a<br />competitor to vendor products from Microsoft and other commercial<br />companies. The Linux operating system runs on over 35 different hardware<br />architectures ranging from IBM zSeries mainframes down to hand-held<br />devices like the HP iPAQ and Sharp Zarus. The name Extreme Linux is<br />taken to mean high performance clusters of computers, powerful<br />supercomputers and high availability application clusters.<br /><br />Silicon Graphics, SGI, and the SGI logo are registered trademarks and<br />Altix is a trademark of Silicon Graphics, Inc., in the United States<br />and/or other countries worldwide.
