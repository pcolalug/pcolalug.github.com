					Title: <b>Got a netbook I can borrow?</b><br />

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am going on a trip next week and was not planning to take a notebook with me. Mainly this is due to space. I am making a 2 week international trip and trying to go as light as possible. Already having to take an extra suitcase full of books.<br /><br />But, I have decided that it would be good to have a place where I can dump media each day in case my cameras or recorder gets stolen.<br /><br />Do you have a netbook lying around that has a USB plug and SD card reader you can let me borrow? I am willing, and able, to pay for the machine if it gets lost stolen or damaged. I have no real use for one on a regular basis, so am not interested in purchasing one just for this trip.<br /><br />Ideally this would be a machine that I can format the drive and do a fresh install, to make sure there is as little as possible on it when I go through customs. Though that is not necessary.<br /><br />I imagine that this is the kind of equipment someone in the group has that can be parted with for a couple of weeks. Send me a PM and let me know what you got. I will leave first thing Monday morning (11/30). The sooner we can work this out the better. If there happens to be one on sale for $100 on Friday I may pick it up, but I am really not interested in having one full time.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sorry, but I don&#039;t own a netbook.<br /><br />However, you can get an Acer Aspire One 10.1&quot; Netbook with 1GB RAM, 160GB HD, with XP for&nbsp; $149.99 at Office Max on Black Friday.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I ended up buying one. I got the $179 one at Best Buy on Black Friday. Compaq Mini 110c 1100.<br /><br />It will suit me fine. I did not have time to strip it down and throw Linux on there so I am working with Windows XP on this trip. Then I will wash my hands of it. Though I have read that the SD card reader has been problematic in Linux. That is one of the main reasons for getting this is so I can dump pictures on the fly. I will figure it out when I get back.<br /><br />Headed to Africa for the next two weeks. Hold my calls please.</div>
