					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Dalnet (http://www.dal.net), one of the largest &nbsp;IRC networks, has made a change (http://www.dal.net/news/shownews.php3?id=31) to its Acceptable Use Policy (http://www.dal.net/aup). This change states that channels who's primary purpose are for filesharing will not be permitted. How do you feel about this? Here is the article (http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/02/04/055250&mode=thread&tid=95) on /. (http://slashdot.org) about this change.</div>

You can still trade files via DCC as long as the channel is not for file trading alone.<br /><br />I personally don't like this. Okay, I'll air some of my dirty laundry with you guys. I used to be a big warez person. I never used IRC to trade files, but I did go to one on another network for a list of ftp sites. I contributed to that list and ran my own server. Yes, it was wrong, but that was before I really used open source software.<br /><br />Now, with that said, I don't like the fact that they are doing this. They say it isn't because of one particular group, but I think this is going to be very hard to enforce and it opens up legal doorways for them. If they can show that they can play the role of moderators, then they can be forced to moderate any number of things. <br /><br />Copyright infringment is wrong, but so is restrictions on speech and they are opening the door for that being a possibility. I don't use Dalnet and haven't for a long time. Why they are doing this, I don't know. If they think that it will stop the DDoS attacks they have been plagued with, it won't. I would bet that it would bring on more attacks because of immature folks being pissed off when they do close a channel. It's not like DCC puts a lot of strain on the network anyway. All that is sent over the network is a few negotiations and the rest is direct...hence DIRECT Client to Client. It is their network however and they can do with it what they like. I'll keep using EFNet and FDFNet.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I look at this as a liability issue. Of course this brings up a whole new debate on who is liable for what. I, however, look at internet liability in this fashion. (This is all based on the assumption that the servers are hosted in the US.)<br /><br />So, one asks is the phone company liable for illegal conversations over the phone lines? Is the Post Office liable for illegal activities taking place through the mail. The answer is NO because both Mail and Phone conversation are private and the hosting companies would have to invade your privacy in order to find out what you're doing.<br /><br />On the other side of the coin, if drug trafficing is taking place in a bar, out in the open and the owners are aware of it, then are they Liable? YES. A bar is a public place and the owners have knowledge that it's taking place. They also have the means to stop it. In addition, if people start posting notices on the bulletin boards in Winn Dixie advertising drugs available or looking for drugs, Winn Dixie has a responsibility to remove those notices.<br /><br />I look at IRC like a bar. (Some of the same type of people too....) It is a public place with illegal activities taking place out in the open. The hosting company is aware of it. It is their responsibility to try to put a stop to ALL known illegal activities taking place on their server. Oh, and just because the illegal files don't actually traverse their server IMHO they would be considered accessaories because the &quot;deal&quot; is being made through their server. Their server is being used as a bulletin board for setting up these deals. Solution, take down the illegal bulletins.<br /><br /><br />Steve</div>

But that is not allowed in my home. Am I guilty of restricting free speech? No matter what you think of strippers, I should have the say as to what is allowed on my land. Should a stripper have a right to sue me for not allowing this?<br /><br />If you are sharing an illegal file with your friends, that is your business (still illegal). But what makes you think that you have the right to do that through my computer? <br /><br />Dalnet is providing a service to you. They are not public access. They own those systems that you (or whoever) is wanting to do illegal activity on. Why can't they restrict your use?<br /><br />David</div>

They should not be allowed to sue you because you own your land (or maybe your bank does) and you have say over that portion of property. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: steve</div><div class="quote">I look at IRC like a bar.</div><br /><br />If only I could get more than an ASCII beer on IRC rather than going to the store. Point well made though and dpeach backs it up what he was saying. I just hope that they aren't opening up doors to unpleasant things through this action. You are both right because it is their network which they have the ability to police. They might not be 100% successful at policing it, but I agree that they are legally bound in most countries to abide by copywrite laws. <br /><br />I may have once been a proponant of warez, but I no longer find that right or acceptable for me. I will admit to some mp3 sharing through Gnutella, but I mainly use it for previewing music as I buy that which I listen to regularly and try to support the bands more directly by purchasing merchandise and going to concerts when I can. I don't feel so bad about downloading music from time to time, but I also believe in a certain amount of consumer privledge; however, out right theft is always wrong.<br /><br />All and all, I think this is a positive move for Dalnet, but like I said before, I seriously hope this doesn't come back to haunt them in one form or another. I definitely see a revenge of the warez kiddies, but that too will pass. Let's just hope the network survives the DDoS attacks. I would hate to see another public service go down because of some annoying script kiddies.</div>
