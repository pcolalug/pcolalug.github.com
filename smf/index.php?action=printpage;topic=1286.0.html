					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey guys.<br /><br />I'm about to send off my ATI card for an RMA. &nbsp; <br /><br />I managed to pull an Oold (1996) Trident vid card out of my dad's old office pc. &nbsp;Unfortunately elanore's motherboard doesn't know what to do with it. &nbsp;<br /><br />Upon boot it tries to display the text but ends up spitting out collored blocks &nbsp;that look like atari's space invaders. &nbsp; Then it hangs. <br /><br />I wish I was still working downtown. &nbsp;My boss had all kinds of old obsolete video cards before he decided to clean up the place. &nbsp; This is why you NEVER throw good computer equipment away. &nbsp;Lol.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">if that trident card is a pci, you might have to change the bios to look for pci vid rather than agp......that was a problem back december '02 when i built my p4 2.4ghz system with an intel D845PEBT2 board....tried using a temp pci 16mb 3dfx voodoo3 3000....good working card, but my mobo didnt wanna accept it i guess because i shoulda set the bios to pci &nbsp;:roll: &nbsp; but ended up just using a gf4 mx440 agp for a while till i got my gf4 Ti4600<br /><br /><br />try any agp card u can nab and see if it'll work<br /><br /><br />btw, brett lol &nbsp;:roll: &nbsp;what kinda agp cards ya got? &nbsp;:D</div>
