					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you have not heard of podcasting yet, let me introduce you to it. Podcasting is audio Internet. It is an easy way to make mp3s available on your website. Or, more appropriately for the newbie to podcasting, it is an easy way to get mp3s from the websites of others.<br /><br />Many radio shows will make their program available on their site as a downloadable mp3. If they podcast, you are able to use a podcast grabber to collect those podcasts on a regular basis and listen to them on your computer or portable mp3 player.<br /><br />Here are some podcast grabbers:<br />ipodder = ipodder.sourceforge.net (http://ipodder.sourceforge.net)<br />jpodder = www.jpodder.com<br />I use iTunes since I am using the wife's XP box to synch my iPod.<br />There are tons of others which can be found at www.google.com<br /><br />www.podcastalley.com has lots of good information about podcasting and shows to listen to.<br /><br />What got me interested is when I read an article in PC Mag by John C. Dvorak where he talked about him, Leo Laporte and Patrick Norton doing a show called This Week in Tech (http://www.twit.tv) which can be found at: www.twit.tv . From there I have gone crazy with this podcasting thing.<br /><br />With your podcast grabber (or podcatcher) you tell it to get the new shows when they come out. Therefore you only need to get it set up and check each day, or every so often, to see if there are new shows to listen to.<br /><br />If anyone else is listening to podcasts, please list them here. Share any gems you find.<br /><br />Beware that just like everyone thinks they are a website guru, there are thousands of podcasts on every subject from people claiming to be an expert. And, why not, it is free and easy to do. Maybe we can even podcast our monthly meetings some day...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here is another podcast directory. It is new so it is easy to go through all the podcasts that they have on their site (all 5 of them right now). :lol: <br /><br />http://www.pcsites.com/<br /><br />They seem to really focus on tech podcasts. Of course, when you only have 5, it is hard to tell where this will be going.<br /><br />Yet another one:<br /><br />http://loomia.com/</div>
