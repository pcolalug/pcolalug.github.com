					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks, but I looked at that yesterday, and its part of a proprietary toolkit (unless I am mistaken and this is part of the standard ssl libs?). &nbsp;I kinda need to do this on the cheap. &nbsp;I did find, however, that Mozilla has extensions in its Javascript engine that allows a call like this:<div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"><span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>try&#123;<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">	</span><span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>crypto.generateCRMFRequest&#40;&#41;;<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>&#125;catch&#40;e&#41;&#123;<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">	</span><span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>alert&#40;&quot;no go.&quot;&#41;;<br /><span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>&#125;</div>I think I'll play with this some and let you know how it comes out. &nbsp;Thanks for your help, imnes!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would guess it's free open-source stuff. &nbsp;It's installed on my default RedHat system. &nbsp;I don't know anything about SSL, but the example commands given on that manual page seem to work fine.<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"><br />&#91;imnes@nick imnes&#93;$ openssl req -newkey rsa&#58;1024 -keyout key.pem -out req.pem<br />Using configuration from /usr/share/ssl/openssl.cnf<br />Generating a 1024 bit RSA private key<br />........................++++++<br />..............++++++<br />writing new private key to 'key.pem'<br /></div><br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Looks like OpenSSL is part of the CygWin package. &nbsp;If you get that installed you can check and let everyone else know for sure.<br /><br />The software is hosted on:<br />http://www.cygwin.com/</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Cygwin has saved my butt more and more lately. &nbsp;I went ahead and dl'd the latest OpenSSH and built it in Cygwin, since that seemed much easier than using VC++. &nbsp;Anyway, once I generated the request per the command line above, I took the key to our CA so I could get a cirtificate. The whole reason we're doing this is that we need an offline meathod of getting certs, so he pasted the output from openssl into Netscape CMS and voila, Randall had his new cert. I brought the new cert (cert.p7b) back to my desk and copied back down to the harddrive as cert.pem. I then had to do the following<div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">openssl pkcs12 -export -in cert.pem -inkey key.pem &nbsp;-name &quot;Randall Burt&quot; -out p12cert.p12</div><br />I then used IE to import the pkcs12 file into my local keystore. &nbsp;To test, I signed a small Outlook macro and restarted Outlook. To my wonder and amazement, I was offered the opportunity to trust myself! &nbsp;Thanks agiain for your help. <br /><br />Now, I have to document the whole process as I am leaving this job for another one at the end of this month. &nbsp;I hope to maybe post it as an article for the group.</div>

The shop I am in now is 100% Microsoft. Visual Studio, MSSQL Server, Citrix, yadda yadda. &nbsp;I think that if you represent yourself as having excellent general programming skills and a deep understanding of the fundamentals of design and development, the rest is syntax. Now, as for where I'm going, the environment is more open to new/different (read non-MS) technologies. The project I'll be moving too will be using J2EE, as I mentioned, but that's just preliminary. IMHO, just concentrate on being the best *programmer* you can be. Play with any and all languages you can, and constantly improve your craft in fun ways.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">So far I know C, C++, PowerBASIC, Pascal, Delphi/Kylix, Assembler, ASP (vbscript), PHP, SQL (MySQL, PostGreSQL, and Access). &nbsp;C skills are strong, haven't played around with OO in C++ much yet. &nbsp;I haven't played with Java at all, I might give that a try next.<br /><br />Sounds good, let me know if you find any job openings. &nbsp;Thanks ;)<br /><br />Nick<br />imnes@go.com</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">No problem. Be sure to email dave.malicoat@cnet.navy.mil if you are interested in the VB position. VB is easy to pick up but can be pretty intolerable at times. And, as a C programmer at heart, C can never go out of style!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I am glad you got that figured out. I was getting ready to find out what Certificate Requesting was and why you would want to generate it. Then I could tell you how to do it.<br /><br />Now I can save myself the trouble of even finding out what you are talking about.<br /><br />David</div>
