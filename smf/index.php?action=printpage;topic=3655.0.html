					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Mplayer has always worked well for me.&nbsp; There are various codec packages around that might be required, you would need to search the Fedora repositories for something like that probably, although there may even be some codecs on the Mplayer homepage.&nbsp; I know that there is also a browser plugin that enables watching &quot;embedded&quot; .wmv&#039;s on webpages.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I second mplayer + the plugin pack.&nbsp; It&#039;s available straight from the mplayer page, IIRC, and should also be in the repository of your choice for Fedora.&nbsp; I&#039;m also a fan of VLC, which works great for lots of things too.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">VLC has a mozilla plugin which works rather nicely imho.&nbsp; However, it sounds like sandspur just needs a WMV codec which may or may not be in the Fedora repositories.<br /><br />You may have to add the RPMFusion repository if it&#039;s not in the official one.&nbsp; &nbsp;http://rpmfusion.org/</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would also recommend VLC. I am not certain about this, but I think that once you install VLC then it installs many of the codecs you will need that other players can pull from. I use VLC for my general video needs on my Linux machines, my wife&#039;s Mac and my son&#039;s Windows box. Any time I can have one program that works on all the machines in the house, I like that. </div>
