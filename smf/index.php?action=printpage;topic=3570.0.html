					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think I have just what you are looking for. I needed a reason to dig around in the storage area. I will let you know what I find. But if I still have it, it is a DX2 66 from Dell. It won&#039;t have a hard drive, but should have memory and be completely intact other than the drive.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want anything for it unless you happen to have a couple of sticks of PC2100 or PC2700 non-ECC RAM you want to toss my way.<br /><br />I can bring it to the meeting on Thursday if that will work for you.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Awesome. I have yet to go to any of the meetings :( The sad part is that I have been a stalker here for a while now. I work from 1:30 PM till Midnight on Thursday&#039;s so it wouldn&#039;t be possible for me to attend the meetings at the present time. I&#039;m hoping to change my schedule around in the next few months. <br /><br />I do have several PC2100 sticks laying around that I don&#039;t need. They aren&#039;t much (128MB or 256MB Sticks, I may have a 512MB stick, will need to check) but you are more than welcome to them. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I dug around for that machine last night. I am sorry to report that I have already given it away. I actually kinda remember doing so now. It was about this time in 2004 that I passed that machine on to bhoff when I moved to Mexico. I was using it as a file server and just donated it to him when I was trying to pare down my hardware.<br /><br />Sorry about that.</div>
