					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Has anyone had any experience with the Transgaming WineX? It looks like they released 2.1 on August 1 and it's suppose to allow playing games like Civilization III, Warcraft III, &nbsp;Grand Theft Auto 3, and Black and White. There are suppose to be a bunch of Windoze games it can play. I've heard good and bad things about it. The bad is that they say it is slow. I'm just wondering how true this is before I invest in it so I can play my games.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I had a 3 month subscription that just ran out. &nbsp;I couldn't get really new games to run, especially those that didn't allow you to forgo DirectX installation (IW2). &nbsp;DeusEx was a bit choppy, but that was on an older video card. &nbsp;<br /><br />My advice is to head on over to TuxGames (http://www.tuxgames.com) and support the cause. &nbsp;I seem to remember that CivIII is available as a native Linux app. &nbsp;<br /><br />Also, there are some neat games being developed with the Torque Engine (http://www.garagegames.com), which was called V12 when it was used to develop Tribes 2 (also available for Linux). &nbsp;This engine is cross-platform and pretty beefy. &nbsp;At $US100 per developer for the engine, its really attractive to hobbysits and small developers. &nbsp;The best, IMHO, has got to be Dogs of Prey (http://nmckenna.hosting365.ie/Darkhand/index.php), a cartoonish flight sim. &nbsp;Beta is available for Windows only right now, but they say that the Linux version should be ready soon (not like Bioware's (http://nwn.bioware.com/downloads/linuxclient.html) version of &quot;soon&quot; either!).</div>
