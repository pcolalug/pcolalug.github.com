					Title: <b>Mandrake Development Process Changes</b><br />

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here is an article about changes Mandrake is making in their distro release process. Looks like they will go through the usual process of making a release and then let the community work with it for a few months and make changes and bug fixes as needed and then release a stable release as the &quot;Official Release&quot;. I am in full agreement with this especially after the release of 9.2. There were a lot of problems with it. I think this will solve those kinds of problems for most people. Here is the article<br />http://linuxtoday.com/developer/2004020202426NWMDSW</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yes, I would agree, and think this is a Good Thing. &nbsp;Glad to see that Mandrake is perhaps listening to it's customers.<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think that is great. I have had very few issues with 9.2, but there have been some. As far as I can tell Mandrake has been very quick to release bug patches, but the fact that some of these were in a release seems odd. Mandrake keeps my vote for a while.</div>
