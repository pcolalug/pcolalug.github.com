					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay Java programmers. &nbsp;The GNU Java Compiler has been around for a while and works really well, allowing you to compile java source or bytecode to a native executable. <br /><br />It was missing Swing / AWT so to get a GUI app you had to use something like native widget bindings (qt/gtk) or some other library (swt). &nbsp;<br /><br />The gnu 'classpath' project finally seems to have a decet working swing/awt implementation. &nbsp; You can build the gjc compiler to generate xlib or gtk code out of swing source. &nbsp;So what this means is you can take your typically slow / ugly interpreted java swing app and just recompile it to be a completely native gtk executable :) <br /><br />I've just been reading about it but haven't gotten around to trying it yet but if it works as well as people are claiming it should be sweet. &nbsp;I'd like to try recompiling something like LimeWire on it. <br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Nice. I'd heard you could compile SWT apps with it, but being able to use Swing will help a lot of folks get acclamated. It would be nicer to have more native targets (Qt, Win32, Cocoa, etc), but I'm sure that will come with time.<br /><br />Anyway, skinnable Swing isn't so terribly slow or ugly (depending on the skin) on a modern machine anymore and SWT is dreamy.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">My only problem with swing is I don't want a skinned app I want a native-looking app. &nbsp;Even when swing apps try to mimic a default look and feel it always feels sligihtly out of place, maybe I'm too picky :)</div>
