					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">newbieA,<br />Welcome!<br /><br />bhoff is the one that I hear talking most about shell scripting. If you need help getting started, he is the one to ask. He has plenty of resources on hand as well as could tell you where to look for information.<br /><br />I agree with danc that shell scripting (bash is my choice) is the life of a SysAdmin.<br /><br />(Listen to me talk! You would think I actually have written a line of code and that I am a SysAdmin for a large firm.)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Perl and PHP are similar languages, learn one and the other one's pretty easy to pick up. &nbsp;PHP is easier and it's what I use for shell scripting and web scripting (although I'm moving into java territory now.)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">insert($0.02);<br /><br />Okay, shell scripting is easy, but hard. It is easy syntax wise, but you have to know what the other commands and programs do in the system.<br /><br />Perl is nice, but can be rather overwhelming with its philosophy of &quot;more than one way to get things done&quot;. One advantage of Perl though is, to quote rburt3, if all else fails, you can do it with Perl.<br /><br />My suggestions (and my own plan of action) is to learn shell scripting enough to get some stuff done, then perl and then php. php can be used for system based scripting, but it really shines in webdev. <br /><br />Another good scripted language you might want to look at, if you don't know any right now, is Python. It is supposed to be very simple and good for beginners. Green Tea Press (http://www.greenteapress.com/index.html) has an open book series <i>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</i>. They have three versions; Python (http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/), Java (http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkapjava/) and C++ (http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkcpp/). I plan on reading the Python version soon.<br /><br />Green Tea also has a book that is currently in the works, <i>Learning Perl the Hard Way</i> (http://www.greenteapress.com/perl/). According to the author, it is aimed at someone who already knows how to program and wants to learn Perl and get to doing cool stuff quickly.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am not qualified to answer your question. However I did recently start learning PHP. It is very easy to learn. Also why don't you check out some of the books in the library if one interests you check it out. I know for a fact that there is books on PHP and Perl. There is on shells but no sure if it covers scripting. The Library has been a great resource for me.<br /><br />Trigger</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok, I'll jump in...<br /><br />Though I don't know it, really, I think Perl is the way to go. Its ubiquitous on all *nix systems (and easy to set up on others) and is independent of the installed shell (do the BSD's still default to csh or tsch?). It seems to be the sysadmin's &quot;go-to&quot; language.<br /><br />PHP is nice and all, but you'd have to set it up yourself on many systems.<br /><br />While bash is nice (why would you use anything else???), there's still no guarentee that it would be available on all systems you may wind up responsable for.<br /><br />Perl may be a tough row to hoe if you haven't had much programming experience, and the myriad ways of going about expressing your algorithm can be frustrating, but stick with it and you'll have a skill that will *always* come in handy, no matter what platform you are working with.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The nicest thing about PERL is the CPAN (the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network). &nbsp;A big collection of ready to use code modules. &nbsp;If you're gonna play with perl, definitely check it out. &nbsp;http://www.cpan.org/</div>
