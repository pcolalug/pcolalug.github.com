					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have been wanting to become a l33t h&x0r for a long time, but never really gotten around to it. My main focus, career-wise, is admin, but I want to at least have the knowledge to bang out a utility should I need it. <br /><br />I know Perl well enough to do simple things (with a reference book) and know ASP well enough to modify code and I've done &quot;Hello, World!&quot; in python, vb and c. I think I have the very low basics down, but what would be a good language to learn? I've been thinking about pursuing C. What would be a good direction to take and what are some good resources to use?<br /><br />Please keep in mind that I'm in a remote location, so online resources are best. Thanks!<br /><br />-------<br />Ruggy</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well if you're wanting to learn something easy and forgiving, just for the sake of learning the basics about programming, go for QBasic in DOS/Win or tcl in linux. &nbsp;I think they're by far the most relaxed and easy to pickup languages.<br /><br />If you're feeling more adventurous, you could always try Kylix, it's linux version of Delphi / C++ Builder and they have a free version. &nbsp;You can write simple console apps in Pascal code, and then point-and-click your way to some really neat XWindows apps without having to write much code. &nbsp;Pretty fun to play around in.<br /><br />And if the thought of pointers and objects isn't too scary, then go straight for C or C++. &nbsp;There's by far more free online tutorials relaiting to the subject, and pretty much every linux/bsd distro will have the compiler installed by default. &nbsp;This is the hardest way to go, but it's the language of choice for most geeks.<br /><br />Have fun HaXor ;)<br /><br />Nick</div>

Though I'd wager to say Perl can quickly overwhelm with it's &quot;More than one way&quot; philosophy.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend jumping right into the deep end with C or C++, though. &nbsp;Not until you've at least gotten a bit more comfortable with another language or two anyways.<br /><br />crowe</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I have a copy of The C Programming Language by K&R (which I'm told is pretty much the C bible) and then a book by the guy who came up with C++. I have read some of K&R &nbsp;and I follow it well, but there are some topics that aren't covered in depth. I feel I should be taking some CS class to cover these subjects more. I am also scared that in learning on my own, I might develop bad habits as well as missing some of the core CS concepts. I plan on going back to school at some point to pursue a CS, so I don't want my bad habits to come back and bite me in the butt later.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />-------<br />Ruggy</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok, here goes. It doesn't matter. Pick Javascript. Hell, you want some fun? Might I sugguest Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) or, as its known in hackish, The Wizard Book (I know, I know, I just can't leave some things alone...Have I mentioned Gentoo (http://www.gentoo.org) this week?).<br /><br />The truth of the matter is that learning a language will not make you a good programmer, nor will it prepare you to solve problems with programming. So many languages are good at so many different things. So, just pick one, <i>any</i> one, and concentrate more on how to think about making the bits dance to your tune.<br /><br />I know this may not be too helpful, so here's the obligitory language sugguestion: Java. Its easy to pick up, is more object oriented than most, well documented, runs on most platforms, and there are <i>tons</i> of free development tools out there.<br /><br />Oh, yeah, what crowe said. The &quot;simple&quot; languages like those in the &quot;Basic&quot; family will rot your brain and make you unfit for any computer-related occupation. These are to be avoided at all costs. Hmm. Ok, so it matters <i>a bit</i>.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: rburt3</div><div class="quote">Might I sugguest Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs...</div><br /><br />Well, I'm going to start reading it (even though I really should be reading some other stuff for my job). I am more interested in learn the method of programming and the thought process to accomplish what I want. My problem is I tend to go the long way around things. My Perl scripts look terrible compared to someone else's, but I realize that is my inexperience; however, I want that to change.</div>
