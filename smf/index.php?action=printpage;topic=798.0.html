					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I was thinking maybe we could do a bi-monthly Lan Party and Swap Meet all in one so it keep it interesting. I used to belong to Computer Society of West Florida years ago and they used to do swap meets. Sometimes people would bring stuff to give away not just sell and lots lots of old parts. &nbsp;They stopped doing this and meetings got boring since they geared towards retired folks who never touched or didn't know how to use a computer so I stopped attending.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">At the last one we talked about doing it quarterly. I am all for doing it every week, but I think it would loose its excitement that often.<br /><br />Quarterly is my vote, but alas, it was not an option.<br /><br />Welcome to the group.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The vote is kind of rude......................Since we use the generousity of one of our members to host the party.<br />As I know of only one of us has the room and Equipment to host such an event. So it is basically up to him unless someone else has the room to host it.<br />Not trying to be rude just logical!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">To second dpeach here, I think Jesse was open to hosting an event once a quarter. In the interim, we've started playing Enemy Territory on-line every Thursday night at 8:00. Jesse has kindly provided the bandwidth for these things.<br /><br />One thing I've found fun is, since Rugmonster is in town, he's come over last Thursday and played on my connection. If several members want to get together in small groups and share a LAN, that would be cool. That way, everyone gets to play together and those that have broadband can have a few folks over for the LAN-party feel.<br /><br />As to holding it more frequently, well, I suppose that would be do-able, but I wonder if the bulk of our members wouldn't get &quot;burned out&quot;. I know I couldn't make a more frequent event and would wind up showing up once a quarter anyway. You would, of course, have to come up with a place to host a more frequent event.<br /><br />Ultamately, if you'd like to volanteer to host an event (live swap-meet, LAN party, both, or whatever), you are more than welcome to use this forum to organize it and gauge interest, just let someone on the steering committee (dpeach, rburt3, newton, or steve) know what you want to do so that we can make sure its appropriate to put Pcola LUG's name on it (no, we will not endorse a &quot;LAN-party/Wet T-shirt contest&quot;, though you are welcome to let the group know you're having one... ;)).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I was just getting info. Bi-monthly or once every 2 months is not that bad. I am new to this group so I was not aware that the Lan party was held at somebodies house. I guess I could hold it at my house but I only have 1 5 port hub unless somebody has a hub. &nbsp;I recently talked to some other people at Office Depot the other day who stop attending meetings and didn't like the lan parties. The couple who I talked to said that the lan parties where poorly organized and they showed up with Unreal Tournament installed but no one else had it installed and there was no agreement of what games to play. &nbsp;I figured the best way to counter this would be to organize and first poll to gauge what people want. It's not rude just straight forward. You don't have to agree; that's what the poll is for.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: Starraisin</div><div class="quote">... they showed up with Unreal Tournament installed but no one else had it installed and there was no agreement of what games to play.</div><br /><br />I did, but I was one of 3 people who had the retail version. Also, many folks showed up without rigs that would play these games. Yes, the first party didn't go smoothly, but I had fun. BTW, I can't recall any members who were at the first LAN party that have dropped out. There were some non-members there, but they never joined/came to any meetings. Could these be the folks you met?<br /><br />The problem as I see it is that most of our members aren't gamers. We therefor have a small population to draw LAN participants from. The last LAN party was great because we played one game, the game was free, and the majority of folks had thier rigs set up before hand. The conclusion would be that to pull this off &quot;in-group&quot;, so to speak, would be to limit the planned games to one or two and make sure everyone is playing the same thing at the same time. There just aren't enough members interested in gaming, in my experience, to warrent a large selection of games.<br /><br />Also, I think many Linux users either don't have the money and/or interest in paying for and playing games. Their computer is entertaining enough in-and-of itself. Also, you find many folks have Linux installed on an older machine that just doesn't have the power to play many modern games.<br /><br />Guess this turned into a bit of a diatribe, but this has engendered an interesting set of discussion points. How can we make our LAN events better and generate more participation?</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think that this last LAN party went over so well because we settled on one game. All but one of our memebers was able to run that on their systems.<br /><br />We did offer several options before the party, but ended up with just one game. I think in the future we ought to have one game with one alternative. If we can decide beforehand which game will be our main one, people can get it installed and test before the big night.<br /><br />It is nice to have everyone there that can help work out kinks. But if everyone is playing but you, no one wants to help figure out your problem. (I experienced that at the December party). If we know before the big night what we are going to play, we can get the problems worked out before we even show up.<br /><br />Good discussion. <br /><br />Starraisin, do you have a broadband connection? That has been helpful at hightechwizard's house. If someone shows up and finds out that they need a driver, it sure is nice to just go and get it off the web.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don't know the member names of whom I talked to. They were not at the June meeting and the june meeting was the first meeting I have ever been to. &nbsp;It was just a casual conversation while waiting in line at Office Depot. I never asked their names. In a side note, I logged into the P'lug ET server the other day with Windows XP; (I know you will hate me for it =0) nobody was on and it worked just fine. I don't think matters what OS you use in ET as long as there is a client for it. &nbsp;I am still searching for the perfect Linux. The ones I tried so Corel 1.0, Cladara 2.3, Mandrake 8.0. I am gonna try Redhat or maybe Mandrake 9.1 or 9.2 when it comes out.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: Starraisin</div><div class="quote">...with Windows XP; (I know you will hate me for it =0)</div><br /><br />I want to clear something up with everyone. The use of other operating systems besides linux is okay. In my opinion, and no it isn't humble, every operating system has its place. I don't know if you guys realize it, but we talk occasionally about the BSDs. You know what, those are a completely seperate operating system from linux. They too use a different kernel and are in no way a different distribution. With that said, everyone has their reason for running what they run.<br /><br />With that said, I would seriously frown on anyone who gave a guest or member a hard time for showing up to a LUG LAN Party with a Windows box. Randall makes a good point in that not everyone has linux on their primary box, but that shouldn't mean they are excluded from an event.<br /><br />Just because we are called a Linux User's Group, it doesn't mean we exclude or look down on everything else. We are all computer users and I hope that the members are willing to see that linux isn't always the answer and there are other things out there that are when linux isn't.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Honestly, while everyone was eating at the last LAN party, I booted Windows 98 on my HP and played a few rounds of Counter Strike!! :shock: &nbsp;But I also booted Windows 98 inside Linux at that very same event!! &nbsp;M$ has been tamed by me!!! &nbsp;Muaahhahaha ..... &nbsp;While I tend to agree with the idea that we could break it up to a few people's house with broadband, think about that. &nbsp;We'd have to have some sort of seating arrangement thingie and we'd still have to agree on who's houses. &nbsp;But.... &nbsp;If anyone else would like to do that, I do have a nice cable connection we could use. :wink: &nbsp;If you guys want to... &nbsp;We can..... &nbsp;I'll see about finding a rogue programmer who's possibly ported Counter Strike to Linux. &nbsp;:twisted:</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">What would be fun is to have all Allieds at one house and Axis at another. That way we could freely talk out loud so that no one from the other team could hear. I know we had talked about setting up in two different rooms at the next meeting. Two houses could be the answer. Of course, if we split up with all the experienced players at one house and the newbies at another, then that would not be too fair.</div>

My friend Will pays the subscription for it and says that CS runs better with it than it does on under windows for him. No, it isn't native to linux, but seems to be one of the few programs that actually run good under one of the Wine's.<br /><br />And yeah, the room thing is a great idea. We played lots of CS in the desert. We would have the Network Control Center where I worked versus everyone else. Since we could all communicate freely, we kicked everyone else's butt. It definitely adds another dynamic to the game. We should look into gettings some sort of speach enabled because there are those of us who can't make it to the LAN parties phycially, but can still join from afar. By the way, thanks for thinking of us. :wink:</div>

Were not all that young (or at least we don't have all our hair). This is not the general consensus of everyone here. We would love to have you at the LAN party. I have been to the two previous ones and they were a blast. I won't be able to make this next one though.<br /><br />Let me encourage everyone that even if you cannot bring a computer to the party, show up anyway. Of course there will be alot more fun if you have your own box. If you are having any problems with your machine, I offer our assistance (easy to say since I won't be there).<br /><br />Looking forward to the report of how this LAN party goes. Don't worry about saving me any pizza rburt. I'll catch up with you at Pizza Hut when I get back in town.</div>
