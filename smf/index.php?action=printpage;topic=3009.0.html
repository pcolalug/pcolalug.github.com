					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Howdy all....<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I had Sai Soma look over my resume, he made quite a few recommendations for improvement. So the last couple of weeks I have been busy rewriting it. Last week I decided to test it. I sent out &quot;two&quot; locally and it looks like I may have an interview next week at Eglin. Thats muuuuuch better!!!!<br />I thought I would post this info in case anyone else is floundering on thier job search. I didn&#039;t think a resume format, wordy stuff etc was really that critical. To the resume gods it must be!!!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That is a step in the right direction. Obviously you won&#039;t get a job from every interview, but at least you got the interview. Congrats. I hope you get a few more to get you that job.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think I might have an interview with Aerotek. They are a placement company like Kelly I think. Has anyone had any experience with them?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you&#039;re searching around for placement companies stay away from PMI.&nbsp; That place is hell on your job security.&nbsp; It&#039;s like a revolving door there.&nbsp; 80% employee turnover.<br /><br />Speaking of which, does anyone know of an online employer rating website, they have one for professors, surely they must have one for companies.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">There&#039;s always time for Quake!!!! Its part of my daily therapy. The job is pretty good, the place is like working in someone&#039;s messy garage. I needed more space to put paperwork, so I stacked empty boxes to make a table of sorts. I still bug Home Depot to get a night stocking job. I&#039;m currently waiting for someone to die and try to get their position. Well thats about it...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I never got the job at Home Depot but I did get a job doing SATCOM in southern Afghanistan. I&#039;ve been here a month now. If anyone is interested in Sys Admin &quot;windows server 2003&quot; or Network Admin, bring your cert&#039;s they will help, The company is&nbsp; ITT Systems. There are also openings in Kuwait and Iraq.&nbsp; &nbsp; Alan</div>
