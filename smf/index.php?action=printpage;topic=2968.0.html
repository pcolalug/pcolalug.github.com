					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well I&#039;ve been getting the itch to do some building. So I started getting my electronics gear back together.<br />First was a power supply for the work bench. I had a surplus of at power supplies, so using an idea I got from hackaday I built one.<br />Using an old computer power supply worked really well. First it came out as a nice brick shape easy to store and secondly the +/- 5v and +/- 12v are perfect for<br />computer related projects.<br />Here are a couple of pics of it.<br />(http://img508.imageshack.us/img508/4279/misc001qa9.jpg)<br />(http://img458.imageshack.us/img458/3298/misc003bi2.jpg)<br /><br />Note the red Led I added and the on/off switch make a nice tight package.<br />I used a combination thumb screw /banana jack power connectors<br />(http://img20.imageshack.us/img20/6176/misc004hp0.jpg)<br /><br />Also some sneak peeks at my next project. It uses a SBC single board computer and some other misc equipment, planning on putting it into my toyota.<br />(http://img451.imageshack.us/img451/7793/misc005ex9.jpg)<br />Here is the view of my begining material.<br />plug in daughter board to hook up additional pci/isa boards, Mini power supply capable of running on 12vdc, and the SBC<br />it has 256 meg ram, 233 mhz processor, video on board, lcd, scsi, ide, floppy, keyboard and mouse all on board.<br />(http://img451.imageshack.us/img451/9706/misc006wt5.jpg)<br /><br />Hope to post more as the project grows<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">So what is the ultimate goal here? I&#039;m guessing you have something in particular in mind.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well the goal is pretty simple start doind some hardware projects vs software all the time maybe some of our base is more torwards the smell of solder and such. I have always fancied myself a hardware hack from way back.<br />Secondly I would like to take this SBC and make a computer for my truck for wifi mapping. Maybe add a nice lcd and a wificard even a gps get home and down load the results and start building a map of pensacola.<br />Have really not thought that far ahead yet.<br />I also have a twin to this SBC that I would like to make a print server out of it using a ide to flash card and installing slackware for my home use<br />just to say I can.<br /><br />Well hope that gets you more of idea and I am always open to suggestions<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Heh.&nbsp; I swear I&#039;ve seen that SBC before...<br /><br />How much current will that power supply put out?&nbsp; Do you have to put a load on both the 5 and 12v lines for it to work?</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">as to putting load on the 5 and 12 volt rails know It is an old at with on/of button.<br />As to current I am getting 7a on +12v, 0.15a on -12v, 0.15a on -5v and 22a on 5v<br />I am looking to making a variable 0-12vdc output also.<br /><br />Yea it ought to look familiar Charles ..HEHE<br /><br />I got a but load of this stuff from you!<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You know Charles that is interesting!<br />Right now I am getting 11.18vdc which ideally I would like to get 12.2vdc.<br />I will try some resistors across the 5v rails to see if it stabilizes the 12v out.<br />Will let you know. Also I did see that pot inside but did not want to raise the 5v rail.<br />It is at a good steady 5.3vdc which is great for low voltage work with logic and such.<br />My next plan is to see if I can run that SBC off of just +5vdc or if you need the negative voltages and +12vdc.<br />Will post my findings as they become available.<br /><br />And heck yea I would like to get at that trailer again some good stuff in there!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Wow that was quick!<br />I quickly grabbed my handy power supply and tried your suggestion.<br />Sure enough by taking (3) 100ohm resistors I had handy wired them in parallel I went from 11.18vdc to 11.68vdc.<br />Thanks for the handy tip I am going to play with the values and find what I need and wire it in series with a switch to give me a true 12vdc output.<br />Probally go with a nice power resistor for longer life.<br /></div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">As per our earlier discussion I have added a 20w 8ohm power resistor across the +/- 5v rails.<br />This brings my 12 rails to a steady 12.1vdc from a lacking 11.3vdc.<br />I am still getting 5.2vdc on my 5v rails also.<br />I took and ty-rapped it to the vent behind the fan to dissipate any heat.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Note: Got some time to do a little research and found that no modern computer equipment require the -5 and -12 volt rails.<br />They are a throw back from earlier days. Anyway found that the SBC &quot;single board computer&quot; will run from a single +5v or +12v source.<br />I will be connecting both since they are on the power supply for backup. Also found a nice basic stamp project to handle turning on the computer <br />from the status of the vehicle being on or off</div>
