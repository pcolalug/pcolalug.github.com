					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I know most of you live in Pensacola or near there. I have a 50 plus mile trip one way. Just ask Harold, I think it is 65 miles from his house to mine. Anyway it cost me about $25 to make a meeting in gas cost alone and then there is food of course so I look at spending about $30.00 every time I make a meeting so they will be less often.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ed<br />&nbsp; I am sure the fuel prices are keeping some other members from making meetings. I know for me it cost about eight dollars when I drive my truck there and back. Some of our members that can&#039;t make the meetings for one reason or another, stay in touch by joining in on the IRC chat. There is a link directly into PcolaLUG found on our web site front page. Four or five people can usually be found there on any one night. Whatever, stay in touch.<br />Harold</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I won&#039;t be able to attend the next meeting (next Thursday, July 16) due to a class I have every Thursday conveniently at 6 pm.<br /><br /><br />This may be a little far-fetched, but one solution I can think of for those who are unable to attend meetings is perhaps a webcam live video/audio stream accompanied with the IRC chat.&nbsp; The chat window could be displayed using the projector for those at the meeting, who could then also interact with those telecommuting.<br /><br />Again, this may be a bit impractical.<br /><br /><br />Or, you could just dig deep for the good of the LUG (think of it as using the money you saved from not using Windows&nbsp; :P)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This was really last years news when gas was so high. See Brett&#039;s post. It was spam and how this topic got picked I have no idea. Regarding digging deep to pay for gas would you pay a minimum of $24.00 per meeting to attend one meeting a month. That was the least it cost me back then. Now it is about $18.00 gas money to attend a meeting.</div>
