					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><b>*NOTE TIME CHANGE*</b><br /><br />An update to SMF, version 1.0.6, was released today.&nbsp; The update addresses a cross-site scripting vulnerability as well as several minor bugs.&nbsp; I plan to take the forums down for a short bit in the morning after <b>12am CST</b> to complete the upgrade.<br /><br />I also wanted to let everyone know about SMF version 1.1 that is currently in final release candidate state.&nbsp; It currently boasts an improved search engine as well as more flexible search options (searching within a topic, searching through your private messages, etc).&nbsp; Also, the devs have made use of AJAX for topic editing, so you will be able to preview your post without reloading the entire page.&nbsp; There are tons of other enhancements I&#039;m sure everyone will find useful.&nbsp; Once it is officially released, the steering committee will test it and then install it once it meets our seal of approval.&nbsp; More to follow...<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Forums have been upgraded and all seems well.&nbsp; Let me know if you have any problems.&nbsp; I also ran some maintenance on the boards, so don&#039;t be alarmed if you look through old posts and see members from the past show up as Guests.&nbsp; Their accounts were deleted per our account management policy, thus their profiles no longer show up.<br /><br />Happy posting!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just wanted to let everyone know (because I doubt lloydr will), tonight we upgraded the server a bit. Lloyd did the hard work.<br /><br /><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><li>Upgraded to MySQL 5.0.18 from MySQL 4</li><li>Upgraded Apache</li><li>Upgraded to PHP 5.1.2 from PHP4</li><li>Upgraded OpenSSL and OpenSSH</li></ul><br />So, thanks Lloyd. I can now play with PHP 5 objects. Let us know if you notice any weirdness. I think the forums are being displayed faster, but that could just be me.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It is recommended that if you are going to use PHP with Apache 2, then to use the prefork MPM. Something about instabilities with some libraries that are used in PHP and not being able to handle forking correctly. It&#039;s a little over my head, but as of now, you can use Apache 2 with PHP 4.3.0 and higher. Since we are still on Apache 1.3, then we don&#039;t have to worry about that stuff at all. <br /><br />I have no idea about the unread posts. I never use it preferring to go to the forums with new posts instead. Glad it&#039;s working now though.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">After some issues with the upgrade client in the forum software *magically* fixed themselves, I managed to upgrade the forums from 1.1.5 to 1.1.9.&nbsp; Please report any issues found.&nbsp; I also added the Skype name modification, so if you use Skype, you may put your Skype name in to the forums to allow other members to contact you.<br /><br />Ian</div>
