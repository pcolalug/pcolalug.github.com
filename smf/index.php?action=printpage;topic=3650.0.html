					Title: <b>Getting your USB mouse recognized</b><br />
					Post by: <b>dpeach</b> on <b>February 10, 2010, 12:12:14 pm</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have an occasional USB mouse problem. I am running Kubuntu 9.10 (some kind of K adjective with a K animal name).*<br /><br />Sometimes when I insert my wireless USB mouse dongle into the computer it seemingly is not recognized. The mouse does not respond. However, when I do a dmesg I see output that indicates that the mouse is indeed recognized and is given all the credentials to work. If I unplug it and plug it back in enough it will eventually work just fine. But this sometimes needs more than 30 tries. I got frustrated this morning and went in search of a solution.<br /><br />It is as simple as issuing this command in a terminal:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">sudo modprobe usbhid</div><br />If you are having problems with other USB devices you can modprobe the kernel module for the device and it should work. I don&#039;t know what those would be since I have not had issues with other devices and looked them up. You can probably easily find your module on Google and just use the &#039;sudo modprobe xxx&#039; command.<br /><br />*I hate the Ubuntu names. Ubuntu&#039;s numbering system is the best I have ever seen. You can know your version based on when it was released. With the animal names I know it is alphabetical, but you have to know what the last letter was that was used to know if you have the latest. I take any opportunity I can to say this in hopes that the Ubuntu community will stop using the names to the exclusion of the version numbers. It is terrible to go to a help site and find that I have to get a chart out to see which version of Ubuntu the site is referring to. If you would just use the numbers it would clear up all doubt.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">David have you tried other usb mice to see if yours may be faulty?&nbsp; Here is a link that may fix your problem.<br />https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/36339 (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/36339)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don&#039;t think it is a faulty mouse since the mouse works in another computer (Windows) flawlessly. And when it does work, it works perfectly and never loses its connection. dmesg sees the mouse every time I plug-unplug-plug it in. It is just that the usbhid module is not loading right. But a sudo modprobe usbhid takes care of it.<br /><br />However, I am curious to try this from that link you provided:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">I currently use a workaround for this issue, which might be acceptable for the rest of you:<br /><br />In &quot;/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist&quot; find:<br /><br /># these drivers are very simple, the HID drivers are usually preferred<br />blacklist usbmouse<br />blacklist usbkbd<br /><br />add<br /><br />blacklist usbhid<br /><br />and comment out the entries for usbmouse / usbkbd as needed. I.e.<br /><br /># these drivers are very simple, the HID drivers are usually preferred<br />#blacklist usbmouse<br />blacklist usbkbd<br />blacklist usbhid</div><br />I am not at that machine to try it right now, but will let you know how it works for me.</div>
