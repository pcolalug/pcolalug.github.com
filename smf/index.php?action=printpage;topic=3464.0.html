					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey guys this is off topic for linux but since some of us dual boot I thought I would let you in on this.<br />There are some very nasty viruses out there the most proflic right now is the windows antivirus 2009.<br />This bugger can do anything from be annoying with pop-ups to righting to you bios. There are several things out there to help you get rid of it though.<br /><br />The first being from our good friends at Lunarsoft with there anti-malware kit found here<br />http://www.lunarsoft.net/news/lunarsoft/390-anti-malware-toolkit-105144 (http://www.lunarsoft.net/news/lunarsoft/390-anti-malware-toolkit-105144)<br /><br />or you can grab the two best tools here.<br />SuperAntispyware<br />http://www.superantispyware.com/ (http://www.superantispyware.com/)<br />or Malware bytes<br />http://www.malwarebytes.org/ (http://www.malwarebytes.org/)<br /><br />the problem is getting these on the machine the best method I have found is to use another computer to install these plus firefox3 and avg free on a usb thumbdrive<br />http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/ (http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/)<br />http://free.avg.com/download?prd=afe (http://free.avg.com/download?prd=afe)<br /><br />then boot the sick computer in safe mode I leave this step up to you to figure out.<br />once windows is up run a full scan with all three tools this will take some time.<br />1st SuperAntiSpyware<br />2nd Malwarebytes<br />3rd AVG<br />now reboot<br />You should see a remarkable difference in your computer use.<br />Also make sure your windows updates are up to date this does include service pack 3<br /><br />So far these steps have saved countless computers I have been called out to help and I hope they help you.<br />....<br />If you really must travel into the unsafe realms of the web you may look into installing Vmware server2 and run an image from there to journey to these places then you can discard the image after you are done.<br />http://www.vmware.com/freedownload/login.php?product=server20 (http://www.vmware.com/freedownload/login.php?product=server20)<br /><br />If you have any questions on these steps you can drop me a pm or email.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have dealt with a few friends and customers with this problem (at the time it was XP Antivirus 2008 but the exact same thing).<br /><br />1) boot into safe mode<br />2) install SuperAntiSpyware (be sure to right click and Run As... administrative name) and run full system scan<br />3) after it is done, reboot into safe mode and re-run full system scan which may clear up a few remnants, then also install and run Avira anti-virus (AVG is crap and a resource hog anymore)<br />4) Reboot to your regular desktop and install and run CCleaner, run the normal cleaning and also run the registry cleaner several times, cleaning it each time. Sometimes I found after an infection, you have to analyze, clean and repeat 4-5 times before it is all gone.<br /><br />After this is all done, install Comodo firewall and remove the SuperantiSpyware (it is a resource hog for everyday use) and install/use Spyware Terminator...<br /><br />Best of all these are all free programs, and rated among the best or THE best.</div>
