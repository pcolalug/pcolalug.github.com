					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">OK. I just got off the phone with Oscar's. We have reservations for 6:00 PM 15 February 2003.<br /><br />Directions:<br /><br />Heading South on &quot;W&quot; St.<br />Turn Left on Cervantes. (Mobile Hwy)<br />Oscar's is the second or third building on the right.<br /><br />If you're not coming down &quot;W&quot; St. then find &quot;W&quot; St. and head south. &nbsp;Follow instructions from above.<br />If you are south of Mobile Hwy/Cervantes then head north on &quot;W&quot; until you reach Fairfield Dr. &nbsp;Make a U turn at Fairfield drive and head south on &quot;W&quot; St. Then follow above instructions. &nbsp;:D <br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">LOL. &nbsp;An alternative (from the south) might be to just turn &quot;right&quot; on Cervantes, instead of going all the way up to Fairfield and coming back down... &nbsp; :shock:</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">BTW, for anyone interested, Oscar's has a seafood buffet on Saturday nights that costs $10.99. They also have menu items available.<br /><br />No, I haven't tried it. I've only been there for their $4 breakfast buffet.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Some Oscars Restaurant lore... This is where Ted Bundy was spotted, and eventually subdued by Pensacola PD.<br /><br />On Feb. 15, 1978, while working the midnight shift, <b>Pensacola</b> Police Officer David Lee was working the Brownsville area. While he was checking buildings, he noticed a Volkswagen Beetle behind <b>Oscar's Restaurant</b> on West Cervantes Street. Almost immediately, the driver pulled the car onto Cervantes and drove to &quot;W&quot; Street, where he turned North with Officer Lee behind him. Lee ran a check on the tag and discovered that the Volkswagen had been reported stolen. Lee pulled it over outside city limits at W and Cross streets near Catholic High School. He ordered the driver out of the car and made him lie down.<br /><br />When Lee approached, the man attacked him and tried to take his gun. It was necessary for Officer Lee to use force to subdue the man. He was then placed under arrest and taken to the Pensacola Police headquarters.<br /><br />Detective Norman Chapman was assigned the case. Chapman interviewed the man and immediately made a connection with him. Chapman sensed there was something different about this man, something unusual that the man was hiding. Chapman established a relationship with the man which would last for many years. The man was very personable and extremely intelligent. However, he was proud of himself. This is the element that Detective Chapman focused on, acting as if he was fascinated with the man's intelligence. After a period of time, the FBI identified the man through his fingerprints.<br /><br />The man was <b>Theodore Bundy</b>, the most notorious serial murderer the world has ever known. During the hours that Chapman interviewed Bundy, he made statements that were to prove significant in the murder case of Kimberly Leach, a 12-year-old girl who was murdered in <b>Lake City </b>and buried in a shallow grave nearby. Bundy was subsequently found guilty of this crime and sentenced to die in the electric chair.<br /><br />Source: http://64.233.187.104/search?q=cache:-nIBSEraeDIJ:www.pensacolapolice.com/history/history_of_ppd.htm+Bundy,+Pensacola&amp;hl=en</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have never been to Oscar's. &nbsp;Is the food good? &nbsp;If nobody has tried the dinner, how was the breakfast?<br /><br /><br />Update:<br /><br />http://www.google.com/local?q=oscar%27s&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;sa=X&amp;near=Pensacola,+FL&amp;latlng=30421111,-87216944,11964732084238233047&amp;radius=0.000000&amp;reviews=1<br /><br />Scott</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Dinner is good, they have both a seafood buffet and also you can order burgers and other stuff from the menu. &nbsp;If I remember right I think the buffet was around $10, other menu items were cheaper.<br /><br />Nick</div>
