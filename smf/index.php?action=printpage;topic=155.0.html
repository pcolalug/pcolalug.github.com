					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, we need to come up with some sort of agenda for the 21 September meeting. <br /><br />A couple of things I'd like to discuss:<br /><br />1. What happened to the LUG fliers?<br />2. What are we going to do about the LUG officers?<br />3. We really need some structure, but that goes right along with number 2.<br /><br /><br />Also, if you checked out a Linux book, don't forget to bring it to the meeting.<br /><br />Oh, and I'll be bringing my new toy. (Zaurus)<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am all for an agenda.<br /><br />I think we need to settle on the officers this month. Or have a plan to settle it before the next meeting. That will give us some definate structure. We need to have everyone there that can possibly come.<br /><br />I don't know about fliers, but I have been working on pricing for business cards. I will bring what I have on that.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I hope I can make it - I'm going to be pretty busy preparing for my presentation at the IT Gulf Coast Summit. &nbsp;I'll be speaking about the history of Linux - y'all come out and cheer me on!!<br /><br />They've got me scheduled for 8 AM (yuck) on Friday, 27 September.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">BTW, I will be bringing the 50 CDs that Mandrake sent me. If someone can come up with and print inserts for them, we can put them out at Books-A-Million that day. Mandrake is getting ready to release 9.0 and I want to get rid of these CDs before then. The insert can be very basic:<br /><br />Pensacola Linux User's Group<br />www.pcolalug.com<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Flyers - Has anyone heard from Newt lately? &nbsp;I was hoping he'd pitch in on the Library mod (don't ask, I can hear it from here... I'm working on it, honest!)<br /><br />Officers - A must. Wasn't there a forum set up for this? &nbsp;We can use polls to actually cast votes.<br /><br />PJC/UWF - We've been spinning on this one for a while. &nbsp;I think it would be to our advantage to try and &quot;make our presence felt&quot; on these campuses. &nbsp;Probably related to the fliers. &nbsp;I can see if my wife could put some up in the Library and the lounge areas at UWF.<br /><br />Liang and I have finally settled on a project to base a Qt presentation around, but its probably going to take us several months to put it together, since he'll be working from China from the end of this month until November. &nbsp;Some office holder should be responsible for coordinating the presentations and working them into the meeting agendas.<br /><br />Speaking of, Ed, you wanna mebe &quot;practice&quot; on us at the meeting? &nbsp;I think a lot of us are familiar with some of the history of Linux, but it would be a real treat to hear it from someone who was there and working on it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">We have flyers to show tonight. They had been sent to Brett for approval, but due to his not having a computer, he was never able to do anything with them. I will print out a copy of the three flyers Newt has put together. Can someone make copies? I can send you the original files when we have one approved.<br /><br />I also have a business card that he sent to Brett. I like the card and will give you prices tonight at the meeting. We probably need to take up an offering to pay for these (sorry for the &quot;churchy&quot; reference, but what do you expect from a preacher). I have found a place here locally that can do them in 48 hours.<br /><br />See you tonight.<br /><br />David</div>
