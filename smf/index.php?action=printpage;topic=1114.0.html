					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Any apple users out there? &nbsp;I was thinking about picking up a user apple g3 notebook off ebay around christmas, was wondering what the minimum specs for OSX to actually be useful?<br /><br />For around $300-$400 I can get something around 400-450mhz. &nbsp;The ram and HD specs on those models are low, but I have a 20gb laptop HD sitting here I can put in it, and I would max out the ram as well. &nbsp;But is the 400mhz range processors enough power to handle the latest OSX and it's apps?<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just read this last week that Apple had two new notebooks coming out. I think they run the G4 processor, but I really don't remember. Anyway, they were $1000 something for one and $1200 for the other. That included the new 10.3 OS.** (see edit below)<br /><br />I know that this is double your price, but brand new ones are not that bad. The news article I read on it was particularly written because of the low price. They said that Apple is trying to place themselves into the notebook market more and so are lowering their prices.<br /><br />I am generally anti-Apple for the same reasons that I don't like notebooks. But if you are going to go against all I stand for, then getting an Apple would be a great choice.<br /><br />** Here are the specs that I found after posting.<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">The 800-MHz PowerPC G4 iBook, weighing 4.9 pounds, has a suggested retail price of $1,099 and includes a 12.1-inch active-matrix TFT display; 256 MB DDR SDRAM; a 30-GB Ultra ATA hard drive; two USB 2.0 ports; and a slot-load combo drive.<br /><br />The 933-MHz PowerPC G4 iBook, weighing 5.9 pounds, has a suggested retail price of $1,299 and includes a 14.1-inch active-matrix TFT display; 256 MB DDR SDRAM; a 40-GB Ultra ATA hard drive; two USB 2.0 ports; and a slot-load combo drive.<br /><br />The 1.0-GHz PowerPC G4 iBook, weighing 5.9 pounds, has a suggested retail price of $1,499 and includes a 14.1-inch active-matrix TFT display; 256 MB SDRAM; a 60-GB Ultra ATA hard drive; two USB 2.0 ports; and a slot-load combo drive.</div></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">hey,<br /><br />i have a (snow) G3, 600mhz ibook with 640mb ram, and it works decent with osx. the osx install is around 2gb with all the languages and crap, but you can omit those. i really don't think that it would perform very well...what's the max RAM for the clamshell models?<br /><br />i can run photoshop, dreamweaver, safari, and itunes all without too much lag. i have yet to get panther, *sigh*...it looks very promising. good luck on your search!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks,<br /><br />I'm not sure what the max ram is on those, I would guess either 384mb or 512mb? &nbsp;I'll let you know if I find / buy anything soon. &nbsp;If you guys know of anybody local has a mac they want to sell let me know price / specs.<br /><br />Nick</div>
