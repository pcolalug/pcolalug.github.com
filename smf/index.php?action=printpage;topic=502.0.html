					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">In case you all haven't been paying attention, Sharp is getting ready to release the Zaurus SL5600. The big difference seems to be a processor that's twice as fast as the SL5500 and more memory. Other than that, it seems pretty much the same. Here's a Link (http://www.sharpusa.com/products/ModelLanding/0,1058,1027,00.html) to the page.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Is that a new announcement? I looked on the HTML source and it seems to indicate that the page was put up there today. Woo Hoo!<br /><br />I will parrot some of the information that I have read about the new processor. In other words&#8211;I don't know how to substantiate this. The new processor, though it has a clock speed of twice as fast, it benchmarks at about the same speed as the old processor. They have made the move because the ARM processor is on it's way out.<br /><br />I am so excited about the new device, cause that means we should get a new ROM for the 5500. What ROM are you other Z users using? I had the 2.78 and flashed to the OpenZaurus 3.0 last week. I could not get the calendar to synch. Well, actually it did, but it put all my future events on today's date and time. Whevever I would shut the device off and come back on, all the events were back to today's date and time. I could even delete the events and they would come back each time I synched. If I moved the events, or wrote a new event, they would just go back.<br /><br />So all of that to say, I went back to the Sharp ROM. I flashed up to the 2.38 this time though.<br /><br />rburt3, I started experiencing the current time problem that you were having. BTW, the numbers in the .xml file for events is the number of seconds from 1:00 am January 1, 1970. I found out this is a standard Unix thing.<br /><br />David<br />(Mostly) Happy Z user!</div>
