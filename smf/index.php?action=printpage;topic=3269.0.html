					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I had heard of Linux and some of the other names it comes in (Fedora, Ubuntu etc.). I am just fed up with MS Windows. I am having constant problems with it. I formated my hard drive and installed W-98 and tried to upgrade to XP but the disk is bad now (have always kept it in the original container so it should not be damaged).<br /><br />I down loaded Ubuntu and couldn&#039;t get it to install (burn may have been bad) don&#039;t know how to check it for errors.&nbsp; <br /><br />I bought a Linux Magazine Pro with a DVD of Sabayon 3.4e (thinking it had to be a good copy of the program). I can run the live disk but it wouldn&#039;t install either. The magazine sent me another disk but it won&#039;t install either.<br /><br />I look forward to getting some version of Linux installed and I look forward to the meeting 12-15-07.<br /><br />Thanks....</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome.<br /><br />As far as burning your own Linux CD, your CD software needs to be able to create an &quot;ISO&quot; image.&nbsp; The basic CD writing software that came with my computer wasn&#039;t able to create an ISO image, but I downloaded a free program that solved my problem.<br /><br />Once you get past the initial hurdles you&#039;re having you will be surprised at how easy Linux is to use.&nbsp; Personally, I think Linux is easier than Windows.<br /><br />Again, welcome!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You should give PCLinuxOS a try. It is geared toward those who are new to linux. <br />http://www.pclinuxos.com/ (http://www.pclinuxos.com/)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I got the Live Sabayon DVD to work for me.....pretty cool. I wish I could get it to install completely. I may be trying to use a HD thats too small for the install and the partitioning is something I&#039;m not familiar with.<br /><br />Would it be a good idea to bring my PC, monitor, keyboard, and mouse to the meeting?<br /><br />Thanks Again......</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yes.&nbsp; By all means. Hands on is by far the best way to get help. Maybe someone will have a copy of ubuntu or maybe pclinuxos . I would like to help but I am out of town until the sixteenth.-----------Harold<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Good news: I have an Ubuntu live/install pack.<br />Bad news: It&#039;s version 5.04<br /><br />Oh, well. Let me know if I should bring it anyway.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure I have a Debian Etch Netinstall burn around here somewhere, but I&#039;d recommend KUbuntu for starting out.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I do have a 7.10, but it is gnome, so if you want KDE someone else will have to help. I am a gnome fanatic, and so I do not have KDE anything. I&#039;ll bring the gnome unless otherwise specified.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am sure someone can come up with a Kubuntu 7.10 install CD. It is very nice. I had previously shied away from Kubuntu because of how poor the early versions of it were in comparison to the Gnome Ubuntu. But the Kubuntu is great these days. If the original poster is not dead set on one distro over another, then the standard Gnome Ubuntu would be a great start. Though my preference is KDE, Gnome is a good second choice.&nbsp; ;D</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It&#039;s not all that difficult to switch from Ubuntu to Kubuntu after the install, in my experience.<br />For myself, I prefer IceWM. It&#039;s fairly lightweight without being difficult to use, and its menu is heirarchical like that of Windows(tm), which makes more sense to me than the MacOS-ish menus of Gnome.<br />For former Windows(tm) users, I think KDE is more &#039;familiar&#039; in its interface schema. But I&#039;ll be glad to give whatever meager help I can regardless of the UI or distro preference of the user.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have the Sabayon Live DVD and have ben working with it. I like it pretty good. Like I said above...I haven&#039;t been able to get it installed. I think it is KDE (whatever that means), it looks alot like MS Windows. I&#039;m getting used to it any way....but bring whatever yoou guys want to and we can go from there.<br /><br />After going to pclinuxos.org I like the way that OS looked. I will log back in later today....Thanks All</div>
