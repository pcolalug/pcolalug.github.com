					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Come join Mayhem and I in the IRC room. We have been there most nights this week. We are looking for someone else to talk with. We already know each other's Grandmothers maiden names. Please, give us someone new to talk with.<br /><br />If you need help setting up IRC, get with Mayhem, he seems to be quite knowlegable. Hey, he helped me get going, so he can help you too.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, you are going to have to help me out a little more than that. How do I find this out and i can tell you. Will it be in the welcome section for dal-net? I get a bunch of text that they send me each time I log in. There are several numbers. The only one that I see that could be what you are looking for is 6667. But I don't really know if that is it. <br /><br />Let me know if you know how to get this information and I can do it for you.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello all,<br />I have tried to use IRC from windows and Linux and Dalnet will not let me logon. &nbsp; get a message that states that &nbsp;because of abuse form my ISP that I must put the ident program on my computer. &nbsp;I have tried to run it, but I can't get it to work. &nbsp;Any ideas?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well it looks like you have to open port 113 for ident to get through. I don't know if you are behind a firewall (you should be), but you will have to open that port to get through. I don't know this because I have tried it, I know it because of this website (http://www.newircusers.com/broadband.html).<br /><br />I hope this helps. Maybe that is the answer to the original question by rburt3 as well.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">David, I couldn't get past the attept at connection. &nbsp;D'oh! &nbsp;I could look at my firewall log, now couldn't I &nbsp;:roll: &nbsp;? &nbsp;However, I don't have a lot of time this week, what with trying to finish up my article on OEOne, finalizing the specs for the library, and trying to get with Liang on a presentation on Qt for the group. &nbsp;Work also has me swamped, so I might not make it out to irc this week. &nbsp;I'll try again when these other projects find their momentum.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Would you considering moving the chat room to EFNET? &nbsp;There are several servers on that who will still let people in without an IDENT response (like irc.homelien.no:5190). &nbsp;For those who don't want to / cannot poke holes in their firewalls.<br /><br />Just a suggestions.</div>
