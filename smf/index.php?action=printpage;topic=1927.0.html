					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That's right, since NEITHER are out yet but both are expected soon, I thought it'd be hilarious to have a poll of sheer speculation. &nbsp; :lol: <br /><br /><br />Personally I think Half-Life 2 will be stunning and greater longevity, but Halo 2 is shaping up VERY strong. &nbsp;Also I must admit that playing games on Live is a blast because of some of the standards (like standard headset usage and so forth) and Halo 2 is pulling out all the stops with logos, &quot;the couch,&quot; clans, and so forth.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I dunno, probably which will be a better buy. &nbsp;Doesn't really matter though, I like creating just a bit of chaos every once in awhile.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">People are gonna drop when I buy halo2 for console.... (PC cant handle such 1337 graphics like Half-Life2 and Doom3)<br /><br /><br />But I'm deciding whether to get GTA:SA or Halo2. I dont wanna spend 105$, gotta keep some birthday money for family presents. ( Need to find a job soon. )<br /><br />I decided to get GTA: SA, seeing as PS2 is the main console I play [Red Faction2]. I'll grab Halo2 in Christmas.<br /><br /><br />Skydiving, here I come. &nbsp;:wink:</div>
