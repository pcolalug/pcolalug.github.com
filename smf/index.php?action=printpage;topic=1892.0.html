					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Alright, I talked with the wife and rather than an HDTV (because if it's broken whenever we move the Air Force would only give us like $200 for it which would SUCK) we're going to get a new computer. &nbsp;It'll take a couple of months I think in order to get everything together for it (heh, unless someone wants to donate some parts ;)) but I plan to buy it in pieces and hopefully set it up for Linux.<br /><br />Here's my questions, since it's a gaming/graphics rig. &nbsp;First, how much difficulty in general do you people have with nVidia cards? &nbsp;I like their numbers and while my situation itself blows I know I've currently got a strange box.<br /><br />Second, is there a version of Slackware or Mandrake (preferably Slack) that supports the Athlon64? &nbsp;I can run my other 32-bit applications with it by design though, right? &nbsp;I've seen the biggest boosts in performance from the Athlon64 and would REALLY like to use that.<br /><br />Third, here's my list of games I want to run:<br />1)Doom 3<br />2)Warhammer 40K: &nbsp;Dawn of War<br />3)Half-Life 2 (if it's ever released, anyway)<br />4)Vampire Bloodlines<br />5)UT2k4 (MAAAAAYBE...I'm still pretty ticked about it)<br /><br />I know Doom 3 is doable in Linux, what about the others? &nbsp;If there's no binaries released can Wine run it, or at the worst WineX (I like the concept, I just don't like paying for things associated with Linux =P).<br /><br />And fourth, I want to use a Toshiba DVD+-R/RW drive I found on newegg with good reviews for only about $60 (can't remember the model). &nbsp;Can I do that? &nbsp;Where's the compatibility list so I can see if it's on it?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks for your help. &nbsp;It's my dream to finally run a really bad-*** Linux gaming rig for once, I'm hoping now is the time to do it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've never had a problem with my Radeon 9800XT. With that said, I will say that at this point in the graphics card wars, I would buy an nvidia of the current generation. I hear the 6700 is supposed to be a great balance of price and performance, but I don't know if it's available yet.<br /><br />At this point, ATI and Nvidia both have excellent support in Linux (with the exception of ATI laptop display adapters due to the heavy modification laptop manufacturers do to them). Go with what runs what you want to play the best and matches your budget. I look at the price/performance factor and go for the best bang for my buck. You pay for performance, so you have to figure out what is acceptable for you.<br /><br />As for drives, they are based on an industry standard. With that said, drives tend to also perform up to their price tag. With that said, I got the cheapest dvd-rom and cd-rw I could find on newegg and I've been very pleased with them. The one thing I think spending a little more would give you is a quieter drive and possibly a longer lasting drive. The cheap drives are cheap for a reason.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Alright, I've done some researching and some thinking and I THINK I want a Dual-Layer DVD drive. &nbsp;My reasoning is that in my Windows box I salvaged my CD-RW drive out of a previous box which means I've been using the SAME CD-RW drive for over FOUR YEARS. &nbsp;I figure I should get a DVD drive that can stand up to that test of time. &nbsp;Here's what I've come up with:<br /><br />NEC<br />http://www.newegg.com/app/viewproductdesc.asp?description=27-152-023&amp;DEPA=1<br /><br />Lite-On<br />http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=27-106-953&amp;depa=1<br /><br /><br />What do you think? &nbsp;Bit of a shame I've got to dish out just a bit more, but if it gets it done right the first time I'm a fan of that.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">About the video card, I don't see anything that's just a &quot;little&quot; more that'd even be worth it, only if I want to spend another $200~400 more. &nbsp;Plus, honestly, I've never noticed a five-frame-per-second difference so I figure a nice card with 256MB of onboard RAM should be able to push Doom 3 pretty well. &nbsp;In all the benches I've seen where they use the standard 5700 (which to my recollection and research is the 128MB one) it does very well, just above the median, so the double RAM should help push those textures pretty good.<br /><br />If you've got any suggestions on video cards that are only a little more (say, under $100) that are seriously that much better, let me know now as next I'm buying the processor and then more than likely the graphics card. &nbsp;<br /><br />The biggest performance jump I've seen in any benchmark is the Athlon64. &nbsp;It seems that even the lowest end one gives another 20fps+ which should be rather nice running Doom 3 in Linux. &nbsp;:twisted: <br /><br />The hard drive...well, honestly my 20GB drive in my windows box is overkill, the 120GB drive in my XBox is WAY overkill, I still don't know what to do with the 40GB drive in my Linux box. &nbsp;80GB is more than enough space for four of me, let alone one of me. &nbsp;Consider that if every game I installed had on average 3GB of required space (silly, I know, but assume). &nbsp;In that case I could install three games and still use only 9GB, six games and still use only 18GB, and twelve games and use only 36GB. &nbsp;That's not even half the drive and I've installed more games than I want to play or currently play. &nbsp;Plus the 7200rpm speed seems fine.<br /><br /><br />Oh, if you're wondering why I only use on average about 7GB of space or less on any machine, it dates back to my days of Quake. &nbsp;You remember, the 1GB monster? &nbsp;I managed to get Quake, in full, and everyone else in the family running perfectly fine on a 1.5GB drive, swap space and all. &nbsp;Ever since then I've been a BIG stickler about free space and when I make backups of installation programs and such I remove them from the drive. &nbsp;Now with a DVD burner I should be able to store even more at once, making backing up larger and larger sections of the drive easier.<br /><br /><br /><br />Heh heh, here's a nuts idea: &nbsp;why not install Doom 3 to a DVD-RW? &nbsp;Seriously, it's kooky but I wonder if it would work! &nbsp;I used to run Starcraft off of a Zip-100. &nbsp;:twisted: <br /><br /><br /><br />Thank you for the encouragement about the DVD burner. &nbsp;More than likely I'm going to get that second stick of 512MB of RAM, but I want to see how it does with just 512MB first, then I can see the performance increase with 1GB of RAM.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">About running it on a DVD, I didn't say it had to be fast, I just wondered if I should do it. &nbsp;:twisted: I like to torture programs.<br /><br /><br />HL2 runs on the Source engine and, humorously, Vampire Bloodline will be released before HL2 is. &nbsp;To my knowledge the specs aren't too high for Source, it's not quite the heavy-hitter that Doom 3 is...those lighting routines are designed to take advantage of hardware that hasn't even been invented yet whilst Source, again to my knowledge, is supposed to push current hardware, not future hardware. &nbsp;If in a year a better thing comes out (and it always does) I'd rather spend another $100 on a videocard then and total only spent $200 and have an up-to-game system rather than paying $500 on a card that's going to be too slow, even though it's got the features.<br /><br />Basically, I've had this experience before with my GF3. &nbsp;I went ahead and spent $400 on one right when it came out. &nbsp;Sure, Quake III 0wn3d, but as soon as UT2k3 came out it was already humbled by newer, cheaper cards. &nbsp;It was outdated anyway.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thank you for the clarification about the LE. &nbsp;lloydr, you presented an excellent argument against getting one, I just might look into a regular 5700 though I'd rather have the possibly slower 256MB one rather than one with 128MB that might have faster RAM...I dunno, either way it'll work nicely, and if I end up getting the LE anyway I think I might be able to overclock it up nicely with a little help. &nbsp;I'll see if I can find a 5700 256MB for a reasonable price.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">to expand on what dan said about harddrives:<br /><br />I also would recommend going with a 8mb buffer drive as I've seen the difference with my drives, it's not a huge difference for everyday things but it's noticeable if your copying or moving large amounts of data or loading areas of the more modern games, and the price really is no different between a 2mb buffer and 8mb buffer drive<br /><br />if you want to stick with 80gb, I'd recommend like dan said, going with a western digital or seagate, but personally I prefer western digital as I've put plenty of them into systems for people and for myself and never had a bit of trouble out of them:<br /><br />Western Digital Caviar Special Edition 80gb, 8mb Buffer, 7200RPM : $62.50<br />http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=22-144-122&amp;depa=0<br /><br />if your samsung 2mb buffer drive was going to run you $59, paying $3.50 extra for a WDC caviar SE 8mb buffer drive is definetely worth it<br /><br />Also, might I recommend either getting a good quality powersupply to put into that case or pick a case with a quality powersupply in it already?<br /><br />I've been very happy with Antec TruePower powersupplies and Antec SmartPower powersupplies really aren't that much different in quality<br />If you want to keep that case, here's a good solid &gt;400W powersupply that I use for my main machine and have used for system builds for other people<br />http://www.newegg.com/app/viewproductdesc.asp?description=17-103-908&amp;DEPA=0<br />the price is kinda high but powersupply is one area you DO NOT want to skimp on, cheap powersupplies can usually end up turning a very good sysem build into a pile of junk if the voltages start becoming unstable <br /><br />another option for getting a solid powersupply is just buying a case with a powersupply included that is of good quality:<br />http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProduct.asp?Submit=manufactory&amp;catalog=7&amp;manufactory=1516&amp;DEPA=0&amp;InnerManu=1516<br />majority of those cases will have either an antec smartpower or truepower powersupply, the mid $40-65 range will get you an antec case and a 300-350W antec powersupply and above the $80 range will get you a case and 400W+ powersupply....if you want to stick with the powmax case because of the &quot;looks&quot; then i'd recommend just picking up an antec truepower 430w psu and either chunk or sell the included powersupply<br /><br />also, as far as the 5700LE 256mb being possibly slower than the FX5700 128mb...... heres a fair example of the difference between the FX5700LE and FX5700....take a FX5200 128mb, double the ram on it, then compare it against a FX5700 128mb....ok so you notice how the FX5700 blew the FX5200 out of the water? the main reason is even if the FX5200 had 512mb or even a 1gb of ram, it's still running slower speeds considerably at the core which really can't handle a major overclock at all, but also at the ram which can be overclocked but to the limit of the ram....even if you had 2x or 4x the amount of video ram on a slower clocked card, it wouldn't be able to compete with higher clocked cards because that 250MHz core just can't push enough data<br />your best bet for video card is get spend about $150-160 on atleast a FX5700 256mb card if you really want 256mb of video ram and then later on down the road spend whatever you want....but why spend maybe $60 less and get a card that would barely play doom3?<br /><br />another thing you can compare is the FX5600 256mb to the FX5700 128mb as far as performance, the FX5600 is clocked lower than the FX5700 but not as low as the FX5700LE, and has 256mb of ram<br />http://www.digit-life.com/articles2/gffx/gffx-9.html<br />notice how even a geforce 4 Ti4200 128mb has an advantage and the FX5600 256mb model they used here is actually the fastest FX5600 256mb card around</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Not to discourage you, but why go with 64-bit for a gaming rig?<br /><br />Your games won't gain all that much of an advantage -- they'd run in 32-bit mode. &nbsp;The only perfomance gain would be in other areas: An increased bus speed, faster memory, etc.<br /><br />Like I said, not trying to discourage you, I'm just trying to understand why you're going 64-bit when you could easily put together a beefier 32-bit gaming machine for the same amount of money.<br /><br /><br />That having been said, I will agree with the part about not skimping on a power supply. &nbsp;Cheap power supplies tend to fail in rather catastrophic ways; &nbsp;that is, they not only crash and burn, but also take anything attached to them in the process.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I've already ordered the case so that has to stay (I'm not going through the hassle of trying to return it) so I suppose I'll just have to save for a better power supply. &nbsp;However, I'm sure that for the short term it'll probably be just fine, I'll just need to upgrade as soon as possible. &nbsp;Up until now I've never had a problem with a cheap power supply, anyway.<br /><br /><br />Thank you for the recommendation on the hard drive. &nbsp;I most certainly do not mind spending just a few extra dollars to get something really nice, I just wasn't that familiar with them in terms of brand and buffer. &nbsp;Honestly, the Quantum fireball in my HP has done a stellar job and that's usually rated as a very cheap drive. &nbsp;Never had one issue, loads stuff perfectly.<br /><br />Oh, on the Athlon64 idea. &nbsp;From seeing the benchmarks apparently it really helps out quite a bit and I'd like to start moving my computing power into the 64-bit era as soon as possible. &nbsp;I have a feeling that in a few years it could make a rather nice server and it'd be nice to be able to run the current 64-bit server apps. &nbsp;Plus, I suppose I get some bragging rights which I haven't had in over three years computer-wise.<br /><br />I found these cards for video:<br /><br />http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=14-170-044&amp;depa=1<br />$132.00<br />http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=14-180-018&amp;depa=1<br />$134.00<br />http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=14-125-132&amp;depa=1<br />$145.00<br />http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=14-150-049&amp;depa=1<br />$159.00<br /><br />Unfortunately, as you can see, all but the bottom one are out of stock and I don't know how often NewEgg gets new stock. &nbsp;Still, the $134 one looked promising and isn't much more, &lt;$40 (that's acceptable to me). &nbsp;Just after being burned on the &quot;longevity&quot; of my GF3 I vowed not to pay more than $150 on a graphics card again. &nbsp;I'll buy another one if I need it, but by the time that happens faster ones with the same features will be available for that $150 range once more.<br /><br />With those changes in mind, I think this'll turn out nicely and even with 1GB of RAM it's still under $800 which is good. &nbsp;It'll just take a bit longer to build unfortunately. &nbsp;Bit of a shame my workplace can't hire me on fulltime, hmm...or anyone pay for some gigs...and so on and so forth.<br /><br />Thank you for the assistance thus far, it's been a long time since I built a machine from parts but I think it'll be really nice. &nbsp;Do let me know what you think of the cards I found, where I might find them in stock when I'm eady to buy if NewEgg isn't.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It's a game of chance either way. &nbsp;I got an Antec (supposed to be really good) power supply for my last system and it died about 2 weeks into use. &nbsp;I needed a quick replacement so I headed into town and got a cheap, noname $20 replacement and it's been running solid for over a year now.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">so far every antec smartpower and truepower(and truecontrol) powersupply i've used has never even given me unstable voltages, antec truepower 430w(True430) about to be 2 years old, antec truepower 330w(True330) about to be 1 year old, builds for other people that were smartpower 300w, smartpower 350w, truepower 430w, truecontrol 550w, etc and none have had problems other than 1 problem of a build for another person with a truepower 430w being used without a ups or decent surge suppression during a big electrical storm.....<br /><br />even have an ancient antec smartpower 250w AT powersupply that is god knows how old, still works great and has stable voltages within +/- 2%(5v rail are within +/- 4% or 5% though) of the rated spec<br /><br />top quality powersupply would probaly be either PC Power &amp; Cooling's TurboCool models or Antec's new NeoPower powersupply, but either way your going to be paying over $100(the pc power &amp; cooling are usually over $200 though, the antec neopower is barely over $100 for the 480w i believe it is)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">&lt;shrugs&gt; Well, it's going to have to wait either way, not like I can slap everything together at once unfortunately. &nbsp;I was going to buy a case without a power supply but those were just as expensive.<br /><br />I've now run the gamut of a few vid card companies for nVidia and so far haven't seen one drastically better than the other since I don't usually do overclocking and bundled software/accessories don't do anything for me. &nbsp;Still, if the others do not become available I suppose I'll have to purchase the Gainward. &nbsp;It might be &quot;just a few more dollars&quot; but you have to draw the line somewhere or you'll just keep adding &quot;a few more dollars.&quot; &nbsp;:wink: <br /><br /><br />I suppose my GF3 has done reasonably well, given now three years, but now it's hopelessly outdated and it was a far cry from its promise of performance. &nbsp;Quite an interesting time we're in where hardware for the most part outstrips software in terms of features and performance, since the things the GF3 implemented weren't even fully realized in software applications until Doom 3 and by that time the GF3s themselves were too slow and didn't have enough RAM.<br /><br />This means that all that time I could've done just fine with a cheaper card and had several upgrades before I even touched the original cost of my hopelessly outdated card. &nbsp;Since I tried the &quot;foresight&quot; approach previously and it didn't serve me satisfactorially (after all, it was THE newest thing on the market, set to change the way graphics worked, and Doom 3 was going to take full advantage of it) after say, six months, I think I'll try the route of buying a card every year.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Having just built a system earlier this year, I would suggest not skimping on video card. I spent a good deal on a Radeon 9800XT and plan on buying a new motherboard and pci-x video card, with plans on new processor the following spring. <br /><br />My theory on building a gaming system, start with your video card and buy as much as you can afford now. Geforce 6800 GDDR 128MB (not GT or Ultra) are running about $270. Save up a little more since it seems you are buying piece by piece and it will go a long way.<br /><br />If you're planning on making this a gaming system, you need to make sure you have a quality hard drive. There is a good bit of research I did in choosing my drive as I can tell a huge difference between a cheaper 80GB in one of my systems and the 200GB Seagate I have in my A64 box. It definitely makes a difference in games like Doom3. <br /><br />Also, I bought a cheap power supply and had terrible power issues. Voltage was very unstable, so I spent about $100 on an Antec Truepower and haven't looked back.<br /><br />When you say &quot;gaming&quot; system, you are opening yourself up to a higher level of spending. If you expect to run the newer games, video card and system memory are probably the two most important factors, followed by hard drive and processor. Last year, I was playing ET on a P3 550 with 512 MB SDRAM, 17 GB 5400 RPM IBM drive and GeforceFX 5200.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Alright, I did it. &nbsp;It made me queasy (no joke) but I racked up $700 on my credit card and my stuff should be here soon. &nbsp;Following suggestions here I think I grabbed some quality stuff and I'm pretty excited...this is my first new machine in three years and I'm really looking forward to running Slackware, Gentoo, or Mandrake on it now that I found an ISO burning program for Windows that WORKS...and not pirated but free. &nbsp;:lol: <br /><br /><br />Anyway, I don't have the links offhand but here's what comes to mind:<br /><br />ThermalTake 410W Power supply that's AMD and Intel Approved (from the reviews of power supplies I was reading that's a BIG thing)<br />Gainward FX5700 256MB. &nbsp;Not the absolute best, but rock solid.<br />That WD 80GB hard drive Rugmonster suggested. &nbsp;Supposed to not suck down as much power as a Seagate which is of course a good thing.<br />That NEC dual layer DVD burner. &nbsp;Can't wait to back up our movies for trips and consolidating my backup CDs.<br />That Turtle Beach sound card. &nbsp;Easily overlooked but it should provide some GREAT sound.<br />That AMD64 2800+.<br />1GB of Corsair ValueSelect RAM. &nbsp;Not Dual-channel because my mobo, being mostly in a foreign language, isn't REAL clear about how its dual-channel support and I don't want it to be incompatible.<br /><br /><br />I suppose that's about all that comes to mind, can't remember if I left anything out. &nbsp;Awesome stuff, though, I'm really, really excited. &nbsp;Should provide some great performance for Doom 3 and HL 2 and nothing else I'm interested in playing is nearly as taxing as those two. &nbsp;I'm fully ready to be spending some serious time in front of my computer screen again (though my XBox is going to get some loving when Halo 2 comes out...can't wait for that one, this should tide me over).<br /><br /><br />Anyway, thank you for all the support and assistance. &nbsp;I think I've put together something real nice for only about $820 which, while over my original budget just a bit, is still excellent and should last me awhile.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Gentoo has always been geared as a make it yourself. I think they still call it a metadistribution because you're basically doing LFS with the aid of Portage. The difference is you don't have to type ./configure --option --option... &amp; make &amp; make install a bunch. While there have been a couple of installers made for it to do binary packages (they exist), most people who use Gentoo don't care for them. If you want something that is going to be up in a short amount of time, with not as much work, go with a binary distro like SuSE on that A64.<br /><br />You can post the pictures. Didn't want to steal your thunder.</div>
