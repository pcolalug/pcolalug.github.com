					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Do any LUG members living in the Pensacola area have CDs laying around for an older version of RedHat? &nbsp;Maybe like 7.2. &nbsp;I am looking for a version where one of the installation choices is for a laptop.<br /><br />Have an old IBM ThinkPad 600. &nbsp;128 MB RAM, 2 gig HD, CD ROM, 1 USB port, 2 PCMCIA slots. &nbsp;Have Windows ME on it now but would like to get Linux running on it.<br /><br />If the software is available I'll consider attempting an installation at the next meeting.<br /><br />Open to suggestions regarding other RMP based distributions.<br /><br />Chuck</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm pretty sure I do, unless I've chunked them thinking I wouldn't need them. I know I've made sets for 6.2, 7.1, 7.2, 8.0 &amp; &nbsp;9.0. If I do, I can bring them to the LAN party this weekend.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Have you thought of trying another distrobution on it? &nbsp;I just don't see the point of using an older release of a distrobution, when you could have up to date software.<br />For example, I'm sure it's possible to install mandriva, or any other rpm based distro, and heavily customize it to run as lean as possible.<br /><br />But then again, my bud pat has a laptop close to your discription, it runs slackware very nicely (it's nice lean and fast from the gitgo).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Brent---<br /><br />Game for another appropitate distribution. &nbsp;My goals are simple: &nbsp;Internet connection with DSL, basic word processor like AbiWord. &nbsp;I'm a PGP enthusiast and I may have to hunt down library files. &nbsp;Early RH realeases have them.<br /><br />Chuck</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Chuck,<br /><br />Sounds like we should be able to get all that stuff running. &nbsp;I would agree with the thought of using a more up-to-date distribution. &nbsp;That way you have all the latest security patches, and the applications will be much newer versions. &nbsp;<br /><br />I'll have a good selection of distros on CD with me, and we can talk over what you'd like to do. &nbsp;Should be fun, see you there.<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have redhat 7.2 disk and use it exclusively for my Cluster. have all the updates also and all primary services have the lastest greatest security updates....2.4.22-4 kernel was outstanding the only real need to go with the latest greatest is to either get access to newer drivers and services for your newer machine or to feed your ego. Either is a good reason but there is nothing wrong with the older versions you will not find one developer in the opensource community developing on the latest greatest.....some of the greats worked with nothing more than RH 5.2 :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I put my hands on my RH9 CD's last night, but apparently I chunked all of the prior versions. I'll have them with me Saturday in case you need them.</div>
