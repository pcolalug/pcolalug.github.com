					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I loaded it on two computers and had totally different issues. In the end it works great so far. The first computer with a lower end Soyo 600 dragon board and a Xp2200 gave me fits. I had to vi the XF86Config to get the xserver to start. I had to vi lilo to set the apic to &quot;on&quot; to shutdown, I had to modprobe the usb to get the usb to work. I also had sound and network problems. But on my dual athlon on a GA-7dpxdw-p board, everything configured right on the install. I have had a flaky sound server error about arts overloading the cpu, but the sound works so not sure what thats about. I installed Nvidia drivers, quake3 and point release and it all worked fine.&nbsp; The layout is much nicer than Mandrake 10.0 . also they fixed the stupid usb 2.0 bug!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thats all folks!!!<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Dudes and Dudettes,<br />&nbsp; I have found a couple of things that are problems. The first, it seems that Firefox is a bit unstable. I have had a couple lockups using it and a couple times it just blew away. I think it does that on my son&#039;s XP computer too. The other seems to be an issue with Lexmark printer drivers? I used my son&#039;s Lexmark Z23 printer a few times when I had Mandrake 10.0 loaded and it worked just great. So I installed it the other day and everything looked fine with the install but nothing would print. No errors, just like the printer was dead. So I found another Lexmark printer and tried it and the same thing, dead. So I went an bought an HP printer, it installed and worked great.&nbsp; So there ya have it....<br />&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve been wanting to try Mandriva, and I&#039;ve downloaded all three ISOs, and burned them to CDs, but when I try to boot from CD, it loads up something called DR DOS, and stops with an A:\ prompt.&nbsp; I&#039;ve downloaded files from several different mirrors, but I&#039;ve gotten the same results.&nbsp; Where did everyone else download from?&nbsp; I&#039;ve been using Mandriva.org.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">LinkZero, I ordered mine from the Mandriva store. Sounds strange, like bad downloads? Not sure what the deal is.&nbsp; You could barrow mine and try if you live close, Pace. <br />I did find one thing, don&#039;t try to uninstall LM_sensors!!!&nbsp; I loaded it to monitor cpu temps and it was filling up my syslog with loads of error messages. So I use the builtin uninstaller and I was hosed big time.&nbsp; I do remember reading something about not uninstalling it, after I did it, DOH!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Actually, I figured out what it was.&nbsp; I was burning the CD the wrong way.&nbsp; It put the ISO on the CD, but it just treated it like a file, not an ISO.&nbsp; Although, Mandriva still didn&#039;t work right.&nbsp; There was a driver I needed that I couldn&#039;t get without purchasing a copy of Mandriva instead of downloading it.&nbsp; I&#039;m using Ubuntu right now.&nbsp; Still ironing out some details with it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">After a couple of months I did find some anoying things. The stupid &quot;KAT&quot; thing would start crashing and spew out loads of errors. I don&#039;t know why. I did find out you can uninstall it urpme kat. My Firefox has been ok, I was still getting a few stupid popups from tribalfusion and casslemeadia. I found you can add / vi them to /etc/hosts to block them out too. I hated the startup jingle so I switched it back to the old mandrake one. It is under configure your desktop, system notifications. For some reason it took me the longest time to find it. Other than that it seems great.</div>
