					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I had been using Debain Etch on my laptop for a year. It was a pain to setup but worked more or less. Occasional lock ups, Configure sound, mouse pad didn&#039;t work right, Didn&#039;t detect the wireless device, installing Flash and a bunch of other stuff. anyway....<br />I installed Mandriva 2008 a month ago and it has been really nice.&nbsp; <br />I did find a few things... Totem and lindvd have issues, so I use Mplayer.<br />The audio jack for headphones still doesn&#039;t work. It looks like it doesn&#039;t work for most distros, I think its an Alsa thing. So I had to setup Mplayer to us my USB headphones.<br />I did discover I have a wireless device... Mandriva detected it but didn&#039;t load the drivers which it has on the cd. I bought this super cheap laptop and I didn&#039;t check if it had wireless, didn&#039;t really need it until I was stuck in a few airports, DOH!&nbsp; Some day when I can get to a place that has wireless I&#039;ll check ad see if it works.<br />I didn&#039;t have to download anything extra.&nbsp; <br />I also installed it on my computer at home and everything worked perfect. <br />&nbsp;</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yeah. Laptops are tricky beasts. Things that Just Work on a desktop often don&#039;t on a laptop.<br />I had to put Ubuntu on my business laptop because of hardware issues.<br />The headphoe jack seems odd to me, but I&#039;d venture to guess that&#039;s a hardware thing, too, because headphones Just Work on my Lenovo (running Etch).<br />I&#039;m glad to see you got it working well.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Glad to hear Mandriva worked for you.&nbsp; :D<br /><br />And yes, laptops are tricky beasts.&nbsp; I guess it kind of sucks that I have to learn Linux on my only computer, which happens to be a laptop, full of proprietary Intel chips which often lack linux drivers, but hey, I&#039;m not complaining... much.<br /><br />However, sound has never been an issue with me, thankfully.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I found my wireless will connect to a linksys router but not connect to another computer running windozes. I guess thats a windozes thing.? Thats all I have here to check wireless. The linksys is not connect to anything but I was connected to it.<br /><br />I change my system sound to USB. In Debian you have to put the system sound driver in the blacklist file. Mandriva I had to re-index the sound drivers and put that in /etc/modprobe.conf file. <br /><br />Also the Mplayer gui didn&#039;t install and I had to use the installer to find and install it no big deal. I need it for Battlestar Galactica and Ghost Hunters!&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well I just wanted share what I found in case it helps someone.</div>
