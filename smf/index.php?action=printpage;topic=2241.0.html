What else can you call a program that denies security fixes to users whose systems haven't been certified &quot;genuine&quot; by Microsoft? The idea, I think, is for these machines to sit around unprotected until they eventually become useless under the weight of malware. <br /><br />That would presumably happen sometime before the machine would need rebuilding anyway, as Windows machines just eventually seem to quit, victims of the vile system registry. The death march is faster if you frequently install and remove applications, but it seems to happen to every machine eventually. This is the computing equivalent of how some doctors say that everyone will eventually get Alzheimer's—if something else doesn't get them first. <br /><br />Still, before the unprotected machines became useless, they would likely become public nuisances, spewing out spam and malware in search of other unprotected machines or stupid users. That is if the pirates don't find some way around this &quot;Genuine Microsoft Software&quot; verification program that apparently is fast going down the road from voluntary to mandatory.<br /><br />My colleague, Larry Seltzer, wrote a column in which he described the Genuine Microsoft program and said participating was no big deal for Microsoft's customers. Here's some of what he said:<br /><br />Some analysts see considerable risk in Microsoft's &quot;Windows Genuine Advantage&quot; initiative. Click here to read more.<br /><br />&quot;When you want to download some Microsoft updates you will need to run an ActiveX control that confirms your copy of Windows XP is activated and legal. … If you have a legal and activated copy of Windows, the process is over before you know it, and you never have to go through it again on that computer.&quot;<br /><br />What Larry didn't mention is that the ActiveX control asks you to do something the software ought to be able to do on its own. Namely, find and enter the zillion-character Product Key that came with your system or copy of Windows XP. OK, it's really only 25 characters, but it's longer and more random than can be easily memorized.<br /><br />I mention this because I've just purchased a brand new Dell desktop, which is about as Genuine Microsoft as a PC gets. But Microsoft still wants me to enter the Product Key just to make someone in Redmond happy that my OS is genuine and Dell isn't ripping them off. Frankly, that's between Bill Gates and Michael Dell, and I should not be a party to their relationship.<br /><br />Especially when doing the Genuine routine does nothing of value for me. And, hey, wasn't this system already authenticated with Microsoft when I first turned it on? How much more &quot;genuine&quot; can it be? Isn't passing authentication enough already?<br /><br />You'd think Microsoft could just query the machine to prove its authenticity. Instead, the company wants me to enter the Product Key which appears on a sticker that happens to be placed on the bottom left corner of the side panel of the system unit. Which is to say it's at ground level, on the side, and in the back.<br /><br />The chances of me finding a flashlight, putting on my glasses, getting down on my knees and crawling under my desk, then tilting the machine so I can read the numbers out loud for someone else to write down are almost precisely zero.<br /><br />Having to prove to Microsoft for a second time that my new Dell has a legal copy of Windows XP Pro sounds like a joke. But it appears Microsoft is serious, as in seriously wrong.<br /><br />As a creator of intellectual property, I am strongly in favor of stopping software pirates. If Redmond wants customers to prove their software is legal, that's fine with me. But it ought to happen only once—when the machine is first turned on or the software is first installed.<br /><br />Microsoft doesn't need its Genuine program to prove people are running legal software. It already has software authentication and that should be enough.<br /><br />For more insights from David Coursey, check out his Weblog (http://blog.ziffdavis.com/coursey/).<br /><br />Check out eWEEK.com's Windows Center for Microsoft and Windows news, views and analysis. <br /></div><br /><br /><i>Copyright (c) 2005 Ziff Davis Media Inc.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This too will be cracked.<br /><br />Honestly, they cracked XP's copy right protection before it was even released. &nbsp;How long do ya think until this is disabled, or ppl simply download the service packs from a third party distributor?<br /><br />Besides, by the time it gets where they discontinue support for win2k, I can always go back to running linux exclusively. &nbsp;Heck the only reason I even HAVE w2k on here is to play games that won't run on linux. &nbsp;I much prefer slackware for everything.</div>
