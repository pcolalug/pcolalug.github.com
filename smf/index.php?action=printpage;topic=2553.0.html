					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I dont know if this subject goes in the newbie corner or not but since I consider myself a newbie this is it.<br /><br />I'm trying to build a relay_recipients table for postfix and I'm having a hard time with the command. With tables already prebuilt all you gotta do is run the &quot;postmap /etc/postfix/[name fo table]&quot; and it works.<br /><br />I try to have postmap create the *.db with the -q switch and I'm stuck on the key value. maybe my base text file is not written right but it is formated like the other base text files that postmap can work with.<br /><br />Any Takers?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I wouldn't call that a newbie question by any means. Unfortunately, I'm not very familiar with Postfix, so I can't help you out very much there. Just out of curiousity, what is the intended goal of all of this? Sounds like you only want certain mail to be relayed if the recipient is in a predefined whitelist? This isn't a very common thing to do, so I'm curious as to your specific goal. Most setups are that relaying is allowed based on source domain or subnet.</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">the goal is to be a front-end relay amavis/clam/spammassassin scanner for exchange. the external domain is not the same as the internal domain so EX has virtual addressing for the clients.<br /><br />the relay server is the same domain as external domain. <br />there is also a second domain name being routed through.<br />the relay server is also the SOA dns server for both domains.<br /><br />http://postfix.state-of-mind.de/patrick.koetter/mailrelay/<br />gave me a procedure to export users from AD and remote copy&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />too much for me.<br /><br />gave me the config answers I needed to relay for the same domain and I need to build the recipients_relay table.<br /><br />if I try to relay by domain name the MX records loopback the SMTP.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I found this (http://www.postfix.org/STANDARD_CONFIGURATION_README.html#firewall). It talks about the relay_recipient table there. HTH...maybe you've seen it.<br /><br />Also, you may be interested in this perl script (http://flakshack.com/anti-spam/wiki/index.php?page=Automatically+Update+Recipient+Maps+From+Active+Directory) to aid you should you use an AD environment to automatically generate your relay_recipients file directly out of the AD LDAP.</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">so the config option relay_recipients read a table built by postmap<br /><br />relay_recipients = hash:/etc/postfix/relay_recipients<br /><br />whenever i run the &quot;postmap /etc/postix/relay_recipients&quot;<br />I get &quot;warning expected format: key whitespace value&quot; on every line of the text thats in the file relay_recipients<br /><br />So the postmap command is sposed to build the relay_recipients.db<br />with the -q or -d switch but the key value on the switch is where I'm lost.<br /><br />So the post is for help on how the get postmap to build the relay_recipients.db from the text file with a list of the e-mail addresses to be relayed (relay_recipients)</div>

Seems pretty cut and dry there. Also, it sounds like the format you are using in your relay_recipients is incorrect. Try that script I linked in my other post.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">the Fedora core 3 &amp; 4 cd's I made were burned by a bad cdrw, so for convenience at the time I used FC1. Once I got to a CDRW that worked<br />my production install is FC4. I was looking for Mandrake linux two weeks ago with some basic searching and didn't find it. Is Mandriva the smae distribution?</div>
