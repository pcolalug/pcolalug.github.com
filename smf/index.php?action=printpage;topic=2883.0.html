					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Howdy.&nbsp; New to the forums (ok, had them bookmarked for a while, just got around to actually reading anything here).<br /><br />I&#039;ve been administering *nix boxes for about 11 years, mainly focusing on RedHat Enterprise over the last 2 years.&nbsp; I&#039;m a moderately competent php programmer, cisco admin, etc (fairly well rounded).&nbsp; The network I currently administer uses:&nbsp; samba, lamp, RT (www.fsck.com/projects/rt) and many other open source programs.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been hacked a few times, but never anything I couldn&#039;t rebuild from.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m a local net-admin (among other things) and will be more than willing to help anyone out that I can and will likely be posting the occasional question for you guys.&nbsp; Who knows, I might even make a meeting or two.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Howdy SaiSoma!<br /><br />Welcome to the group. Hate to hear that you&#039;ve had systems broken into. I&#039;m sure several of us would be interested to hear the details of those events if you can share. What were some lessons learned and what steps were taken to prevent future breakins? There are several of us involved in the security field here on the forums and speaking for myself would like to know details if you can provide them.<br /><br />Look forward to hearing more from you!</div>
