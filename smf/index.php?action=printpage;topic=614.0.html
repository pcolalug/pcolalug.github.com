					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have sound when I first boot into KDE (Mandrake 9.1). After I log out and try Gnome, then come back into KDE I get an error that tells me my sound card has been captured and that ARtS will not be able to use the card, but that it will output to a null device.<br /><br />Here are the things I know:<br />Works in KDE when first boot up, but not after switching to Gnome and back to KDE.<br />Killing X and relogging into KDE does not bring my sound back.<br />Restarting machine gives me my sound back.<br />Going back into Gnome after this happens does not give sound in Gnome.<br /><br />This is what I don't know (well a short list, I really cannot accurately tell you what I don't know, 'cause if I could then I would know that I don't know it and therefore would probably know it at that point.)<br />I do not know if I have sound in Gnome when first booting up and going in there, I have just never tried it.<br />I don't know if when I switch from KDE to Gnome the first time whether I have sound or not, I have never checked.<br /><br />I am sure it is as simple as shutting down the sound card and having ARtS restart. But, I don't know how to do that.<br /><br />Appreciate the help.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Try this<br /><br />killall esd<br /><br />Then restart KDE.<br /><br />When you run gnome it runs the Esound daemon (esd).<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I did still have a copy of esd running. But after killing it and restarting KDE, it still did not work. I wonder if there is another process that goes hand in hand with it?<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hmm, esd is the only thing that would be blocking audio so far as I know. &nbsp;Maybe a stray lock file in /var/lock or somewhere? &nbsp;Anybody else have any ideas?<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have not fixed the cause of the problem, but I have sound working agian. Strange that after we talked on this issue that I never had sound again, even after a reboot. So I went into Mandrake Control Center and just completely reloaded the sound drivers for my card. That did the trick. I am not in love with Gnome enough to be switching over there often. So, this should not be a big issue.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I too am encountering a sound problem with KDE. &nbsp;I'm running whatever version installed with Mandrake 9.1. &nbsp;When I first loaded 9.1 I found that my sound did not work. &nbsp;I saw David's message and went into the control center. &nbsp;I ended up having to load the alternate driver for my sound card and that seemed to fix the problem.<br /><br />Sound is now out again :x . &nbsp;I was running XMMS and opened Konqueror...that killed all sound and I have not been able to get it back again.<br /><br />I went through everything I did before without success. &nbsp;I went into the mandrake Control Center and tried their sound troubleshooting procedure. &nbsp;Any help would be much appreciated.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I assume that KDE still uses the ArtsD sound server, or did they switch over to ESD? &nbsp;Go into your configuration for XMMS and make sure it's set to use the ArtsD sound output. &nbsp;If it's not going through a sound server and accessing your card directly then that would have blocked access for the rest of KDE from making sounds. &nbsp;But if that's all it is the problem should have cleared up after a reboot if not on its own.<br /><br />Nick</div>
