					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I installed Slackware 9.1 on my test computer today and I am trying to install openoffice 1.1. It requires a file called libiconv-1.9.1-i686-1dl.tgz.. I have extracted it and cd'ed to the folder it made. I ran the command ./configure --prefix=/usr/local and I get this error message &quot;-bash: ./configure: No such file or directory&quot; . Anyone got any ideas as to what I need to do</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ed,<br />Is there some reason you're trying to compile it yourself? &nbsp;I installed it in Slack 9.1 with no difficulty, by using the included &quot;install&quot; script, which is contained in the big tarball downloaded from OpenOffice.org. &nbsp;The filename I have is:<br />OOo_1.1.0_LinuxIntel_install.tar.gz and is about 74.7 Mb in size. &nbsp;I'd recommend you go that route.<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I compiled my openoffice myself back a while back just because I didn't wanna bother locating a slackpack.....but the tgz you extracted and tried doing ./configure, are you sure it wasn't in slackpack form where you just will run installpkg filename.tgz....or i generally just do installpkg firstfewletters* cuz i'm lazy and don't ever feel like typing it all out lol<br /><br />also a good site for slackpack files where all you run is installpkg for installing is<br />http://www.linuxpackages.net<br /><br />p.s. http://www.linuxpackages.net/pkg_details.php?id=2136<br />there is link to that package you were talking about.... gives explanation of why it's lookin for it probaly....I know that one for sure all you do is...as root: <div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">installpkg libiconv-1.9.1-i686-1jim.tgz</div><br />or can just do installpkg libiconv*tgz<br />&nbsp;:wink:<br /><br />also, did you happen to try out dropline-gnome yet?<br />I think the thing about requiring libiconv has to do with not having dropline gnome....er well atleast looks like that when I read the description of the package</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I got openoffice installed. I tried both of your methods. I had problems because I did not read the instructions first but I learned how to install and remove packages in Slackware. Thank you both very much!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ed,<br />Glad to hear you got it going, and are enjoying Slack! &nbsp;It's a great distro. &nbsp;If you are a Gnome desktop fan (like me), you've got to check out Dropline Gnome! &nbsp;It's a Gnome desktop optimized for Slack, and has an auto-update feature that is very nice.<br /><br />http://www.dropline.net/gnome<br /><br />Dan</div>
