					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Wow! Be sure to check out the how-to on creating your own bootable distro based on knoppix. Really great stuff. Think we should put a banner to their site on our page? We reference it a lot, and I think its one of *the* best tools to show folks Linux. I've given quite a few of their cd's away and folks are always impressed.</div>

I just thought it would be nice to reciprocate with a little advertising.</div>
