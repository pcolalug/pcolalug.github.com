					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve got an opening for a network admin.  Pay will not be fabulous, but won&#039;t be bad either (unknown as of yet, working on it), but am willing to accept a technician who needs that little bit more training to step up to the administrator plate.  I will perform all admin duties until employed person is &quot;up to speed.&quot;<br /><br />GREAT benefits, excellent hours and little over time.  In Brewton, AL.  Call 251-809-1531 if interested.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don&#039;t believe I ever met you, though I have been here 7 years, and I can assure you, no gaming site has ever been hosted here, though I do run a personal site (fragfest.net) and check my personal email from here. I also hosted a gaming convention here several years ago, so that may be what you were thinking.<br /><br />I personally run the servers (and always have), so no one &quot;sneaked&quot; anything by me for hosting a web site, that much I can be certain of.<br /><br />I never checked anyone&#039;s books in the library, though the librarians may have?</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">unofficial is one you can typically print off of your college&#039;s website.&nbsp; It has your class information, but it is &quot;unverified&quot; and presented by you and not by your college.<br /><br />An OFFICIAL transcript is different.&nbsp; You request that your college send us a copy and they sent it, not you.&nbsp; That is only required if you are hired for the position, however. The unofficial version that you can print or quickly get a copy from your registrar&#039;s office is fine for the application.<br /><br />Glad to see the interest guys!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am interested to see how many applicants there are and a idea how qualified the hired person is. I am still trying to work out why I get virtually no responce from my resume, bad resume, bad luck, not qualified. This is my oppertunity to try get a little insight into hiring around here. I would guess that this opening is posted other than just here? So the actual number of applicants could be like 50 to 100 or more? Thanks for the info!!&nbsp; &nbsp; Alan<br /><br />&nbsp; I just noticed the Mediacom part. I have applied to them maybe four times within the last year, with 25 years RF experience and never heard a thing! Its just too bazzar. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sure, kind of depends on my wifes work schedule. <br />I talked with the Veteran&#039;s Rep at the Jobs and Benifits center last week, he told me the resume was too long. He said write one page and that most employers won&#039;t read past the first couple of lines! So I have been writting and rewritting it the past few days. I split it into two one IT and the other Electronics and made a keyword attachment for the job site postings.&nbsp; I did get a call this morning from a recruiter asking for my resume, we&#039;ll see.&nbsp; &nbsp;Alan :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would like to add one more off topic post about Alan&#039;s resume.<br /><br />Have you thought about taking your resume and performance reports/awards/decs/etc to a professional resume writer that specializes in military veteran services? I&#039;m probably going to spend the money to have someone who specializes in that sort of thing have a once over of my resume.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also been hearing this as a rule of thumb for lengths of resumes. If you have less than 5 years experience, keep it one page. If you have more than 5 and less than 10, two is appropriate. More than 10, you use what you need. With that in mind, keep things brief and it may be a good idea to still have a very brief one pager and an extended one. Also, don&#039;t think a single resume will cut it. Taylor your resume to the types of jobs you are applying for. For example, if I apply for a LAN/WAN network admin job working on Cisco routers and switches, I&#039;m not going to be emphasizing all of my Windows experience. I&#039;ll be focusing on all of the stuff I know about Cisco and networking in general. Show your diversity of knowledge, but don&#039;t over saturate them with buzzwords.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">A long time ago I went to a resume service and they wrote one for me and I didn&#039;t really like. I think the person didn&#039;t have a technical background. <br />Most of the jobs I have had are either Civil Service or Gov contractor and they want everything you have ever done in your life in them. The bigger the better! So I have been thinking about all of this lately. I have rewritten it split it into two and made them one page. I removed all overseas and unemployment references. I have started to use it and will wait a couple weeks and see what happens.<br />I have heard that tayloring them to each job is best, I sometimes make adjustments if something catches my eye in the job discription.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Here is another thing I ran accross.....I applied for a job with GE through Landrum staffing, an electronic tech, assembly work need to drive a fork lift. I waited a week or two then called them to check what happened. The Landrum person I talked to asked me if I had forklift experienceI said no, but I wouldn&#039;t think thats a big deal to worry about. She said if your experience doesn&#039;t match 100% don&#039;t bother appling. <br />&nbsp; I normally only apply to jobs that I know I can meet 95% of the requirements. I don&#039;t think driving a forklift an engineering level task! But maybe there is a college degree for forklift driving, I don&#039;t know. <br />The more I keep looking into resume writting, job requirements, interviewing, what employers really want, I&#039;m starting to think its more like playing the lottery, buy enough tickets and you&#039;ll win! I have even entertained the thought of a finders fee. Well thats enough for now....Alan&nbsp; </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">A friend of mine got a job at DISA earlier this year. She applied for every single job she saw that had anything to do with system administration, regardless of whether or not she had experience. She was only looking for a job for about 3 months. I think the lag between finishing her last contract job and starting at the DISA job was a month. Most people say that the shotgun approach is best. You have to send out a lot of resumes and be persistent. A good headhunter helps too. If Landrum said that forklift experience was a must, then they described the job wrong. Also, if they told you that, then you need to look elsewhere. It&#039;s their job to find candidates for companies. I think you got the wrong person on the wrong day on that one.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This board is my only connection to the local area. Since I do not have family here I really don&#039;t know anyone.<br />I was a little worried about about getting too far off topic with this resume thing. 1999 was the last time I was in the counrty until last July 05. <br />I think I may be out of touch with things, also my resume / job hunting skills seem to be lacking. I think the worst thing is not getting any feed back from employers. A person has no idea if they were close or the bottom of the list. <br />&nbsp;I have had a few allmosts...when I got back last July it took me about three months to get moved in to a point to search for work. I was contacted by a recruiter for a job in Germany as a network tech. I took it and sign thier &quot;leagally binding contract&quot;. I paid my own way for a new polygraph and renewed my passport. Then waited till this past May and was told there was no job. Well that kind of sucked!&nbsp; Then a friend called me shortly after and said that SAIC need people in Afhganistan so I applied and waited about two months to be told I wasn&#039;t really qualified, AARRGG! During this time I was on a roller coaster of &quot;I think I have a job then the next day thinking I probably didn&#039;t&quot;. I did apply to maybe 30 to 40 openings to see if I could get something as a backup just incase but didn&#039;t. In the past two months I have been cranking out the resumes. And the last thing is, the wife is not amused!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alan :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Alan,<br /><br />It sure sounds to me like your resume is not written correctly.&nbsp; I highly recommend you get someone to help you improve it.<br /><br />There are services like that available free in some places, and for nominal fees elsewhere.&nbsp; One place you should look into is the &quot;Escarosa Job Service&quot; (or something similar to that).&nbsp; It&#039;s located down on &quot;L&quot; Street as I recall.&nbsp; They do job-search training, resume writing, veteran&#039;s assistance, etc...&nbsp; all free.<br /><br />A few months ago I retired from the Navy (electronics tech), and spent a lot of time getting the resume just right.&nbsp; I posted it on all the large job sites, and the job I eventually got was a result of someone seeing me on Monster.com.&nbsp; Try posting to places like that, if you haven&#039;t (including usajobs.com for Civil Service jobs).<br /><br />Have you thought about taking a lesser job in the meanwhile, just to keep something coming in as income?&nbsp; Places like Walmart, HomeDepot, and even fast food, are always hiring.&nbsp; It&#039;s not something you&#039;d want to do forever, but it will pay a few bills.<br /><br />Again, try to come to one of our LUG meetings.&nbsp; We have a lot of expertise on this subject, and someone will be glad to help you.&nbsp; Personally I can&#039;t be at the meeting next weekend, but I&#039;ll be at the next one if you want to bring your resume.&nbsp; It sounds like we have a similar background, so perhaps I can help you get going.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Dan<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks Danc. I&#039;ll try to see if I can make it this comming week. I applied to the Santa Rosa county jail for control room operator. My name was sent forward with 25 other people for that week. Not too encouraging. I still have not heard anything back from Home Depot either. One thing I really did not want to do is hire on somewhere then jump to another job in a month or two. I think this area is a bit small&nbsp; to jump jobs. One of the VET reps at our local unemployment office in Milton loaned me a resume writting book and we talked about resume for awhile.<br />I have my resume post on Monster, AJB, Dice, security clearance jobs, career builders and a bunch of large contrating company sites. I usually get reponces to move to DC and Balitmore. <br />&nbsp;Which brings up another story. On my last job, our project manager came over to site from Hanover MD for a boon doggle a few months before I left. He said If your interested I could look for something back in Hanover for you. Keep in mind your base pay is 5k over new hire engineers, (meaning I would probably take a pay cut). He said, &quot;I don&#039;t know how they can live on 60K a year&quot;. I was thinking to myself &quot;thanks for the warning!&quot; </div>
