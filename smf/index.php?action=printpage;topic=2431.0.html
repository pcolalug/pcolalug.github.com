					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Pentagon wants 1,579 jobs cut from Pensacola NAS <br /><br />Raju Chebium <br />Gannett News Service <br /><br />WASHINGTON - The Pentagon said today it wants to restructure Pensacola Naval Air Station, a move that would cause the loss of 1,579 jobs. <br /><br />The facility would lose 302 military employees and 1,180 civilian ones, according to Defense Department documents. Ninety-seven contractor positions also would be lost. <br /><br />The Naval Air Station is one of 13 Florida military installations that the Defense Department wants to close or reorganize. <br /><br />Whiting Field Naval Air Station, Corry Station and Saufley Field were not on the base realignment list. <br /><br />&quot;Some of the losses in the realignment of Pensacola were not unexpected. However, we can, with community support, fight the relocation of these jobs,&quot; Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Chumuckla, said in a telephone interview. <br /><br />Miller added that his congressional district as a whole would gain jobs. Eglin Air Force Base, for instance, would add 2,218 positions under the proposed restructuring. <br /><br />&quot;It's been a very lucky Friday the 13th for us in Santa Rosa County,&quot; said Pete Gandy, chairman of the Military Regional Oversight Committee, a group formed to protect bases in the two-county area. &quot;Whiting Field is not on the list. I feel great about that. I really do.&quot; <br /><br />Gandy credited a decade of proactive efforts and cooperation between all levels of government to protect the missions of local bases, especially efforts to set aside thousands of acres of land around Whiting Field to prevent encroachment. <br /><br />But Gandy said Santa Rosa's facilities are not yet completely in the clear. &quot;There will be BRAC Commission hearings that take place. They will be looking at other bases,&quot; he said. &quot;The final results of BRAC is a long way from being over, but the odds of getting off this first list would be pretty slim.&quot; <br /><br />The Pentagon wants to close bases not merely to save money, but, more importantly, to modernize the military to fight terrorism and other new threats. <br /><br />But base closures often send economic shock waves through local communities, especially rural towns where there is little other large industry to rehire laid-off civilian workers. <br /><br />Most of the installations on the Pentagon's list will stay there unless the lawmakers, lobbyists and others advocating for them can convince the independent Base Realignment and Closure commission they should be removed. <br /><br />That won't be easy. <br /><br />The previous four BRAC rounds that began in 1988, about 90 percent of the Pentagon's recommendations were enacted, including the closure of 97 major bases. <br /><br />And the rules for the new commission will make changes even more difficult. <br /><br />The commission is supposed to make its decisions free of political considerations, although politics could creep into the process. The commission will consider the economic and environmental impact of potential closures, but the top criterion is supposed to be national security. <br /><br />The nine-member, president-appointed commission is the only player in the BRAC process that can alter the list. Congress and the president can only accept or reject it in its entirety. <br /><br />The commission will spend the summer analyzing the Pentagon list, holding public hearings in or near base communities and making changes to the list where it deems appropriate. The list must be submitted to the president for approval by Sept. 8. <br /><br />Starting Monday, the commission is scheduled to begin a week of hearings on Capitol Hill to question top Pentagon officials about how the list was assembled. <br /><br />Louis Cooper contributed to this report.<br /><br />Source: http://pensacolanewsjournal.com/news/st/0513_brac.shtml</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">To sum it all up, this may or may not be something to worry about, but you will have employment next week, through the summer and probably through the end of the year. Don't sweat it until the the final word has been given. That's when you start looking for another job (or follow you current one).</div>
