					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, it's been rumored for a while, and is now official. &nbsp;From the Slackware -current changelog:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote"><br />Sat Mar 26 23:04:41 PST 2005<br />gnome/*: Removed from -current, and turned over to community support and<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;distribution. I'm not going to rehash all the reasons behind this, but it's<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;been under consideration for more than four years. There are already good<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;projects in place to provide Slackware GNOME for those who want it, and<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;these are more complete than what Slackware has shipped in the past. So, if<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;you're looking for GNOME for Slackware -current, I would recommend looking at<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;these two projects for well-built packages that follow a policy of minimal<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;interference with the base Slackware system:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://gsb.sf.net<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://gware.sf.net<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is also Dropline, of course, which is quite popular. However, due to<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;their policy of adding PAM and replacing large system packages (like the<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;entire X11 system) with their own versions, I can't give quite the same sort<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;of nod to Dropline. Nevertheless, it remains another choice, and it's _your_<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;system, so I will also mention their project:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.dropline.net/gnome/<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Please do not incorrectly interpret any of this as a slight against GNOME<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;itself, which (although it does usually need to be fixed and polished beyond<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the way it ships from upstream more so than, say, KDE or XFce) is a decent<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;desktop choice. So are a lot of others, but Slackware does not need to ship<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;every choice. GNOME is and always has been a moving target (even the<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;stable&quot; releases usually aren't quite ready yet) that really does demand a<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;team to keep up on all the changes (many of which are not always well<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;documented). I fully expect that this move will improve the quality of both<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Slackware itself, and the quality (and quantity) of the GNOME options<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;available for it.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Folks, this is how open source is supposed to work. Enjoy. :-)<br /></div><br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Way to go, Pat (like you'll ever see this). If they just make it too hard to package, why should he have to go out of his way to put it together? That's awesome.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think it is a good move, not just because I am not a Gnome fan. The power of Linux is that you can pick and choose your &quot;modules.&quot; If Pat does not feel he can do justice (regardless of the political issues that are apparently involved) to the inclusion of Gnome, then let someone else do it who will dedicate the time to it to make it right.<br /><br />I like how some of the distros modify the base packaging to make it look custom, but sometimes distros don't have the time/resources/desire to do it well. Good decision and very wise to point to other good projects on the subject.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well it seems to be timed well at least - just as Slackware drops their (outdated) Gnome packages, Novell changes course and starts shipping the latest Gnome release in their packages. &nbsp;(Novell was also stuck on outdated 2.6 Gnome previously, which is I think the last version slackware officially packaged). &nbsp;<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">With the way Pat does he distro, he is pretty much making it on his own. That is a lot of work for one man because it may seem like he's just doing what anyone who does Linux From Scratch would do, but in all truth imagine doing that for several different architectures and creating install packages with configuration scripts and what not. It is a very lengthy, involved process. Compared to nearly all of the other distributions, Pat is probably one of the only ones who still puts together his distro all on his own. Other's have sub-projects to handle package groups.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Luckily I found Freerock's Gnome Slackbuild (GSB) before this happened. Great build of the latest gnome with none of the added crap like dropline, and it's nice to see patrick recommends it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">And you didn't share this with us? &nbsp;Even with all the grousing about dropline on here? &nbsp;:lol: <br /><br />I've moved from gnome &nbsp;back to fluxbox. &nbsp;I'm a mimimalistic type person and I like making the most of my hardware. &nbsp;Even though I could use gnome or kde, I find them overcrowded with unessesary things.<br /><br />I like how I can custom config my menu, and even my keybinds through a simple config file. &nbsp;(Oh and I really like how i can flick though all 4 of my workspaces with my mouse wheel...neato)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don't know I'll have to try again and check it out. &nbsp;Does it create a startup script for it or am I supposed to do it myself?<br /><br />I'm trying to find a good environment for keeping a CVS build of Gnome for bugfixes and testing but having trouble in slackware, jhbuild doesn't like it :) &nbsp; &nbsp;I haven't figured out what the problem is yet, I think maybe the Perl XML parser is a wrong version. &nbsp;It dies trying to build libxslt. &nbsp;First it builds libxml2, maybe it's looking at the slackware version of the lib instead of the cvs version it built when it gets to libxslt? &nbsp;<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">there will be an rc.hal in your /etc/rc.d/<br /><br />just chmod 755 it and have it run at boot, I remember dropline added rc.hal into rc.local since it wasn't it the normal runlevel scripts.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am now also running this Freerock Gnome on Slackware, with a shiny new custom 2.6.11.6 kernel, and it ROCKS! &nbsp;Gnome 2.10 is very nice and the Freerock Gnome package includes some very nice themes with it. &nbsp;I've got my wireless working, sound works, and it's very responsive. &nbsp;I'm liking it a LOT.<br /><br />I'm happy about finding something I like this much, as I think my days with Mandrake are numbered after some of their recent announcements. &nbsp;If you use Slackware and like Gnome, you gotta try this one.<br /><br />Dan</div>
