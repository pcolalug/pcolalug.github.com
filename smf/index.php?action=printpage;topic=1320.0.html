					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you know how to use vi, then I recommend vim or gvim. &nbsp;<br />It has the most syntax highlighters that I'm aware of.<br />Gvim can do code-folding, tags, etc.<br />If you are looking for a full-blown IDE environment, check out KDevelop.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">One of the really nice things about Eclipse is that isn't specifically for any particular language. You can find modules that provide syntax highlighting, checking and more for whatever language you are working with. I know the Perl module includes a regex verfier as well as other niceties.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">+1 for Eclipse. As other folks have said, you can also use the same IDE to do your Java(TM) (Best. Java(TM). IDE. Ever.), PHP, and other development (even FORTRAN, if you're feeling masochistic). Its written in Java(TM), but uses IBM's SWT toolkit, so you'll need to get the GTK-specific version. If you're also feeling adventerous, you can use GJC to compile the whole thing to native code.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've been using vi, just looking for something with more of a gui interface, with maybe an easy syntax lookup reference. I found gice, and could actually translate the spanish menus, but it was missing the reference. Sounds like eclipse is really going to be bag for me, since it seems like I'm constantly flipping languages, (CEN4516 is making us use both Java and C) and you never know when you may need a COBOL editor. (Never mind the age reference that gives) :roll:</div>
