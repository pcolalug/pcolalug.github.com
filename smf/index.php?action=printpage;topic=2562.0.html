					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sounds like a media/cdrom drive problem to me (most likely the drive).<br /><br />If you can't install over a cdrom, just do what I did many moons ago. &nbsp;Give debian's netinstall a try. &nbsp;Last time I did it, you only needed 2 floppies (and a broadband connection :^) to gitter done. &nbsp;Granted, debian is kinda stale, but it's linux.<br /><br />I would have the floppy netinstall link handy for ya, but the debian.org site is being grouchy. &nbsp;If nothing else you could ask on #debian on irc.freenode.net<br /><br />You could also try:<br /><br />http://www.delilinux.de/<br /><br />It's a *really* barebones distro based off of slack 7.1. &nbsp;Supposed to run nice on a 486 w 16mb of ram. &nbsp;<br /><br />Woulda liked to have had this back when I had slack 8.1 running on my old 486. &nbsp;Woulda saved me alot of work.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Could it be that you have a very odd motherboard that isn't supported by the kernel? Disc controller incompatibility perhaps? That's very odd.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">howdy.<br /><br />Have you tried to boot up with a livecd, to see what happens?<br /><br />a few I like: slax, archie, pclinuxos. &nbsp;Pclinuxos has a very nice install-to-hardrive option. &nbsp;It's based on mandrake, but we won't hold that against it! :-)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am beginning to believe that this is a motherboard issue * Perhaps a Microsoft prototype anti Linux board* LOL<br />&nbsp;I have tried diffrent distros including but not limited to suse,slack,debian,knoppix 4 diffrent versions boot from network, disk, usb and cdrom.....changed out ram,harddrive,cdrom and network card.........<br />I am fixing to trash the board and just drop in one of my spares call it my first defeat</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I finally tried one last thing....After thinking thru the process how the boot works by creating a ram disk to work from thought about the weak links what else the internal and external caches for the processor. they are both controlled from the bios I went thru one at a time and sur enough my external cache is capoot......So disabled that and what do you know I now have a new addition for my Cluster.<br /><br />Brett ......Also renamed topic so google could catch it and list it because a lot of people are having the same problem.<br />Thanks a lot to the guys at Pcola Linux User Group pcolalug.org</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Holy crap...I don't know if I would have ever caught that. When you say external cache, are you referring to the memory that was on P1 boards, seperate from RAM? If that's it, I know there are a lot of boards that you could pull that module out and swap in a new one.</div>
