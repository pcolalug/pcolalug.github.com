					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Unfortunatly Not everyone is using Windows and if we want to convert them we have to give them options and the ability to test drive linux while having the ability to feel in control in Windows, While I agree this is a false since of security it is one never the less and a great migration tool</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">bhoff is right.&nbsp; when I switched over to linux as my primary OS it took some time.&nbsp; I ran live environments for months before I actually installed it.<br /><br />DSL was my first live USB linux.&nbsp; Once my current laptop gets replaced I plan on putting it on here so I can have a fast-boot light media PC that I can hook up to a TV or something.</div>
