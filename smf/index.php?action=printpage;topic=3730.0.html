					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Since I still get the mail at the President&#039;s address, I got this that I thought I would pass along in the forums.<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Hi,<br />My name is Michael Frank and I wanted to extend an invitation to the Pensacola Linux Users Group for an event I’m putting together in February called Ignite Pensacola. The premise behind Ignite is to allow people with something to say a chance to share their ideas, stories, and insights with their community in a fun, energetic, and comfortable environment. We want the event to be as diverse as possible so we’re getting word out to Pensacola’s artistic, technical, environmental, and entrepreneurial segments.<br /><br />We wanted to let you know that everyone from the Linux Group is invited as well as make you aware that we’re still accepting speaker submissions. Speaking at Ignite doesn’t require any experience or credentials, just an idea and 5 minutes of your time. Speakers are given exactly 5 minutes to speak and allowed a 20 frame slide show, each slide progressing after 15 seconds. The format makes for some really dynamic presentations.<br /><br />This is going to be the first ever Ignite Pensacola and it’s happening on Tuesday February 8th at 6:30pm during Global Ignite Week where 70+ cities on 6 continents host Ignite events to spark new ideas and raise the collective I.Q. The event will be hosted at Seville Quarter inside Phineas Phogg’s. Please take a look at the website for more details about the event and the history of Ignite.<br /><br />This is a community event so the more groups we can get involved the more our Ignite will represent the voice and culture of Pensacola. If the Pensacola Linux Group has interest in becoming more involved or connected with Ignite Pensacola please let me know. I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you so much for your time.<br /><br />Michael Frank<br />Ignite Pensacola<br />Feb 8th 6:30pm @Seville Quarter<br />http://ignitepensacola.com<br /></div></div>
