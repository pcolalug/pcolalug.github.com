					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">OK, I said I'd get back to you all with my experiances setting up an entertainment computer to replace most of my audio/video stuff.<br /><br />Let met start by saying I am not very happy with ATI and INTEL. Because of them I was up way past midnight last night, playing. <br /><br />Anyway, I got the system put together. &nbsp;In case you missed it in my other post, the system consists of a P4 2.53Ghz processor, (2) 60GB Western Digital 7200RPM drives, 512MB memory, Intel D845PEBT2 (http://www.intel.com/design/motherbd/bt2/index.htm) motherboard with built in Dolby 5.1 audio and optical audio out, 10/100/1000 Network, USB 2.0, and more, and finally to top it all off an ATI 8500DV &nbsp;(http://mirror.ati.com/products/pc/aiwradeon8500dv/index.html)video card, and Windows XP.<br /><br />Anyway, I got everything installed. I had to use a computer monitor at first to get WinXP installed and the initial ATI software installed. Once that was done, I was able to take the system out to the Living room and hook it up to the TV without any computer monitor. The desktop display on the TV is pretty good for a television. &nbsp;The output from the TV tuner was equal to my cable input on the TV, although the audio seemed just a tad lower from the computer. (I have the computer audio out hooked to the TV for now) I was able to put my zip code in the Gemstar program and it downloaded the TV guide for me. Then I could flip through channels. The Remote that came with the video card seems to have a better response than my Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse. <br /><br />I was able to run the live TV broadcast in delay mode so I could pause it or fast forward or replay during the broadcast. (Just like the Tivo) I was also able to set the TV picture up in a window, on the Desktop, full screen, or in transparent mode. (One day, if anyone is interested, I'll see about doing some screen captures to show this) They also have a mode called &quot;Channel Surf&quot;. In this mode the tuner steps through each channel and puts a still picture on the screen. It fills up the screen with small blocks from each channel. You can click on a block for about 5 seconds of live broadcast or double click on it to go to that channel. <br /><br />I was also able to play some AVIs from the computer and they displayed quite well. The DVD player worked very good also. <br /><br />I haven't had time to play with capturing from VCR yet so I'll add more if anyone is interested.<br /><br />Steve</div>
