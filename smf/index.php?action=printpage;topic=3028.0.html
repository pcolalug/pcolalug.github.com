					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have not been able to connect to several web sites starting yesterday morning. I called Mediacom and they said there was a server down somewhere causing the problem. I would think there should be a backup? They said it was one of Yahoo&#039;s and there&#039;s a bunch of stuff is handled by it. My son&#039;s girlfriend in East Milton says her&#039;s work fine. Anyone know what the deal is?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">linuxquestions.org seems to work fine here as well as hitting the SETI site. I also haven&#039;t seen anything on /. or Netcraft about it. Sounds like Mediacom is feeding you a line of crap.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have actually developed a taste for crap. Maybe I shouldn&#039;t have said that....&nbsp; I stopped by thier office and asked what the deal was. One lady knew nothing about it. The other one said there was an issue between Mediacom and Yahoo also MSN. She didn&#039;t know what it was or when it will be fixed!&nbsp; I wanted to check and see if anyone else in the area had problems or knew what was going on.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Mediacom says its Yahoo! They said Yahoo swiched to new software for something called Yahoo live and hosed everything up. He said it effects other ISP than Mediacom and&nbsp; is country wide. They hope to have a firmware fix for the modems hopefully today. He said most secure site won&#039;t work.&nbsp; So there ya have it!!!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Its now the third day without mail. Mediacom still has no idea when it will be working. The tech folks don&#039;t even seem to know what the problem is. I get a different story every time I call.</div>
