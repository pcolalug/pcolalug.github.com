					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I went and got the full version.<br /><br />It's definately worth the download. &nbsp;Most of the rough edges since the test version have been smoothed out, not to mention a bunch of new maps to play.</div>

Besides, crowe and danc will 0wnz0r you no matter how much you practice.<br /><br />Jesse and I need to upgrade the LUG ET server tonight to the full version and get the binary out to our FTP site, so it may not be up at 8:00. I'll post to this thread when its up, or you can check in at the afor mentioned ip every so often after 8:00.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sorry that took so long. We've got the dedicated server running (sans X). You can also get the full version of the game from ftp.inoch.com/games.<br /><br />You will need to connect to our ET server via the ip address 68.99.60.104, as we're sitll not showing up on the master list for some reason.<br /><br />My appologies again for this taking so long. Lets try again another night.</div>
