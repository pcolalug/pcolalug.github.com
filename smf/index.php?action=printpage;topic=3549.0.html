					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Meeting is scheduled to be this Thursday.&nbsp; Forums have been a little quiet this past month it seems, so I&#039;m not sure how many will show up at this meeting, but do try to make it if possible.<br /><br />I personally will be unable to attend this Thursday due to a class.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I will be there! Just got back into town Monday night and leaving Friday morning, but I had to be home for the meeting.<br /><br />I hesitate to sound like I don&#039;t know what is going on (which I don&#039;t), but didn&#039;t someone say they had a presentation they were giving this month? If not, I have plans to share something, but don&#039;t want to commit myself to something specific just yet.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I must apologize to you my friends. I am stuck and unable to attend tonight. I have a 4000 mile trip starting tomorrow and the rear half of my car is all in pieces in my driveway. I have to skip out tonight. I am trying to contact other members of the SC to get things moving the right direction for the meeting.</div>
