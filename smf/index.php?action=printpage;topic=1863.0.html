					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi everybody,<br /><br />I've been to a couple of the Pcolalug meetings now, so some of you would probably recognize me if we were to run into each other. &nbsp;I'm a tall, old guy with a Grey beard and a growing pot-belly. &nbsp;Typical geek, I suppose, except maybe for the old part. &nbsp;And the Grey beard.<br /><br />I started coming to the meetings because I'm determined to shake loose from Windows and I know absolutely nothing about Linux, or anyway I didn't a few months ago. &nbsp;I think I <i>am</i> slowly learning.<br /><br />I usually upgrade my hardware every 5 or 6 years, and I have been using an old 400 MHz Pentium machine for that long at least. &nbsp;So, about six months ago I started gathering the parts to put together a state-of-the-art machine. &nbsp;(State-of-the-art for all of a few days, I know.) &nbsp;I bought a Tyan K8W dual Opteron board, and two 246 cpus for it, with 4 Gigs of on-board ECC memory, and a 6 drive SCSI array controlled with a LSI Megaraid dual controller. &nbsp;I have learned in the past that disk access is a major speed bottleneck and I wanted to implement a raid 5-0 setup, which I did. &nbsp;Then I built the box to put it all in (all 1/4 inch or heaver aluminum plate) with water cooling, back-lit flow meters, CD/DVD burner, etc, and LOTS of pretty blinking lights. &nbsp;I can't lift the thing, but hey, it was never intended as a laptop! &nbsp;Now all it needs is SOFTWARE. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the AMD64 software from everyone is just a little flaky. &nbsp;Actually, it's all a LOT flaky. &nbsp;It is a horribly complex problem, I know, but it will get there eventually. &nbsp;Meanwhile, this is my at-work workstation. &nbsp;I'll just dual-boot for the duration.<br /><br />Work is a tiny little research laboratory here in P'cola called Poiesis Research, Inc. &nbsp;I started this business in '91 after working as a Research Scientist for the Navy at the Navy Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory for several years. &nbsp;I love the independence of “doing my own thing” and would never go back to working for someone else as long as I can keep eating. &nbsp;Pot-bellies require regular maintenance, you know. &nbsp;(The maintenance material of choice is, of course, BEER.) &nbsp;My research emphasis has been on passive hearing protection, but I've also developed things as diverse as new production technologies for high-strength composites, a nice robot arm with true spherical joints, and even a compound bow.<br /><br />I <i>have </i>managed to get SuSE 9.1 up on my machine with SMP and AMD64, and even though I like the idea of Gentoo much more . . . at least I can get this to work! &nbsp;I also want to try OpenBSD when their 3.6 release comes out. &nbsp;I've already ordered the CDs!<br /><br />I'll see you all at the next meeting!<br /><br />Bill Cushman</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have grown out my red beard and found out that it is quite a bit grey in places. So, I too soon may be a grey bearded Linux user.<br /><br />Welcome to the forums Bill.</div>
