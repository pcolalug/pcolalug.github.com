					Title: <b>Package Manager</b><br />

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">My tar ain't workin'.<br /><br />When I try to untar something I crash out Konquerer when done through K. Or if I do it through a console, it tells me it is not a valid file. This happens on everything that I am trying to untar now.<br /><br />It worked before. I am using Mandrake 8.2.<br /><br />Brett suggested that I reinstall the packages through the Package Manager.<br /><br />To do that, at least the way I understand it, I have to remove the package first. Makes sense. But when I tell it I want to remove the package, so that I can reinstall it, it tells me that several other packages will be removed as well. I don't want to remove those, many are part of KDE. I am sure that this will not break anything too seriously, but I want to know that they will all be reinstalled.<br /><br />So my question is: What is the best way to go about this? Should I just uninstall and write down the packages that it is going to remove and manually make sure they all get back in? Sounds like work to me.<br /><br />This problem happened last week and I have not fixed it 'cause I have not needed it. But I know I am going to need it soon.<br /><br />Thanks for your help.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You can try reinstalling using kpackage. I think it has an option to rerun an install.<br /><br />Or, check out the man page on rpm. Try an rpm -i --force packagename.rpm.<br /><br />Steve<br /><br />&nbsp;:mrgreen:</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I tried using kpackage to force a reinstall. It seemed like it would work, but did not do anything after I told it to &quot;Install Marked.&quot; It even crashed kpackage once. <br /><br />I then tried the rpm -i --force packagename.rpm. That worked great. I have tarr back in command line and in konquerer.<br /><br />David</div>
