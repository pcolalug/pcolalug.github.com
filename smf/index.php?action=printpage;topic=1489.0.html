					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay, I give up. &nbsp;How are you SUPPOSED to start KDE from the command line in Slackware 9.1? &nbsp;startx points to gnome right now which is all well and good (since I primarily use it anyway) but starting KDE has become a bit of a humorous chore.<br /><br />&quot;startkde&quot; fails because it's looking for the X server and naturally it seems that this command does not initialize the X server. &nbsp;So! &nbsp;Just for the hell of it I decided to type &quot;xinit&quot; and after changing my screen to the quarter-of-the-screen-is-my-console I typed &quot;startkde&quot; whereupon it worked. &nbsp;However, it's also happening to be running from a terminal window which is mildly humorous but I don't think it's the sort of thing that should be happening. &nbsp;There's also the fact that if you kill the terminal window KDE dies.<br /><br /><br />Another semi-humorous solution has been to start KDE whilst in Gnome. &nbsp;Running one desktop inside of another I find a perverse pleasure in but again, I don't think is something &quot;right.&quot; I think it scares my windows box, though. :twisted: <br /><br /><br />Anyway, how am I SUPPOSED to start up KDE? &nbsp;And is there a quick/easy way to switch between KDE and Gnome in Slack?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Probably the easiest way would be to run the program &quot;xwmconfig&quot; from the command line... &nbsp; :lol: <br /><br />If you'd like, you can browse the directory /etc/X11/xinit where you'll see the scripts for starting the various desktops. &nbsp;I believe all the program above does is set the symlink &quot;xinitrc&quot; to point to the desired desktop script. &nbsp;You can change this manually if you're comfortable with that.<br /><br />On a related note, if you'd like X to start at bootup, just change the default runlevel from &quot;3&quot; to &quot;4&quot; in the /etc/inittab file (the &quot;id:3:initdefault:&quot; line).<br /><br />You mentioned you are using Gnome... &nbsp;If you haven't already, you really should check out Dropline Gnome at http://www.dropline.net/gnome<br />This provides you with an auto-updater and keeps everything very up to date, not to mention that it looks beautiful too. &nbsp;Check it out!<br /><br />BTW, here is an EXCELLENT &quot;book&quot; on Slackware, provides all the answers you'll need... &nbsp;http://www.slackware.org/book/<br /><br />Glad you're enjoying Slackware!<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks a lot, I was thinking I'd have to screw around with redirecting the softlink of xinit manually or something crazy like that.<br /><br />Yeah, I'm running Dropline right now and I love it. &nbsp;Simple, effective, not cluttered at all (a big change from Windows), and it's not too &quot;busy.&quot; Still, I figured I'd give KDE and Fluxbox a go just to see if maybe I'll surprise myself.<br /><br /><br /><br />Right now I'm just figuring out how to upgrade my kernel. &nbsp;Don't want to be going through all the work of compiling the 2.6 and then not be able to boot it properly. &nbsp; :roll: <br /><br />Thanks again for putting Slackware on here. &nbsp;It rocks!</div>
