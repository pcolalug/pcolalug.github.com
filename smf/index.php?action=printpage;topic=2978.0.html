					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m not sure if this is a hardware topic, a Debian topic, or a newbie topic.<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to install Debian.&nbsp; I downloaded the netinstall iso.&nbsp; The image burned successfully, and the install was going well until Debian netinstall could not recognize my cable modem...(ethernet card).......therefore I am unable to download and install any of the packages for Debian.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have an AsusTek M5263 ethernet controller on the motherboard, connected to a cable modem.&nbsp; &nbsp;Am I doing something wrong? perhaps the netinstall does not work with cable modems?&nbsp; Is my ethernet controller not supported?&nbsp; (seems unlikely since SuSe 10 recognized and configured it without any problem).<br /><br />Just not sure where to go from here.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />any troubleshooting suggestions?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">an update.&nbsp; &nbsp; I gave up on Sarge, and downloaded the netinstall for &quot;etch&quot; and it was able to recognize my cable modem and give me a successful install.<br />Now I have lots of reading and experimenting to do.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would try to barrow a known good copy from someone if your having issues. That way you eliminate any download funky stuff. If you where closer I&#039;d bring my Mandriva cd over.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">He got the &quot;testing&quot; netinstall to work. No need in bringing Mandrivel.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Honestly, if he&#039;s running desktop he shouldn&#039;t be running stable.&nbsp; Stable is the server distribution.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I hate the confusion that goes into stable/testing/sid.<br /><br />Stable is just the production release of the Debian distribution. It is meant for all uses. Debian calls its distribution of GNU/Linux the &quot;Universal Operating System.&quot; So stable, while certainly suited well for servers, can also work just fine as a desktop system.<br /><br />Testing is just what its name says. While you can have broken packages every now and then, it is more up to date that Stable. If you ask most Debian purists, few people should be running Testing. People new to the distribution shouldn&#039;t be using it since Stable is the production release and the one that is supported. Once you start to leave Stable, you&#039;re wandering off on your own.<br /><br />Unstable is just that. I run it, but I&#039;ve been running Debian for 6 years now. Stuff breaks! You can do an update and suddenly you are left to recover what was just broken. I have dealt with this on numerous occasions. Think of unstable as permanent early beta. If you run it, then have a problem and go into ##debian on Freenode expecting help, they&#039;ll tell you that you should be running Unstable.<br /><br />So in summary, with Debian, there is no Server/Desktop/Embedded/Kitchen Sink distributions. It&#039;s all how you taylor your install is what makes your install server/desktop/etc. Yes, the packages in Stable are older, but they won&#039;t break. To me, this sounds like the perfect distribution to give to your parents should you get them switched to Debian. Why? Look at the name! STABLE! Most distributions are hell bent on getting the newest packages out with their releases that testing is cursory at best and stability lacks. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I know that.&nbsp; But if I had to give my parents something it would be testing.&nbsp; Testing is a newer stable.&nbsp; Unstable is what you described Testing as being.&nbsp; And Experimental is what you described Unstable as being.&nbsp; Remember, packages have to spend some time in experimental before they can be moved to unstable (with few exceptions).<br /><br />In the last 3 years I&#039;ve only had 4 problems with packages in unstable.&nbsp; 2 from udev, 1 from xserver-xorg-core, and the last from vim which was a little thing (it couldn&#039;t find the syntax highlighting rules).&nbsp; Unfortunately, one of the udevs was when I happened to give the presentation.&nbsp; :/<br /><br />But I myself would never install stable on something with a GUI that I&#039;m going to be using.&nbsp; It&#039;s too old, and the desktop market moves too fast.&nbsp; Case in point: no drivers for Perq&#039;s ethernet card.<br /><br />EDIT: of course, for the absolutely ballsy, you have http://incoming.debian.org/ which is even newer than experimental.</div>
