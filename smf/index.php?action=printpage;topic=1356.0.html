					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just saw a new program tonight called Nvu (pronounced N view). It is from Lindows and claims to be targeting the FrontPage/Dreamweaver market. I don't know that it is that robust, but it does do site managment and WYSIWIG (as well as allowing you to easily edit the HTML on the fly).<br /><br />See here for &nbsp;(http://nvu.com/features.html) it's feature list. I have not downloaded it yet, but am planning on giving it a spin sometime soon.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Its a dressed-up Mozilla HTML editor, isn't it? The impression I get from the site is that its a project along the lines of Firebird (break out the components of Mozilla into stand-alone apps). I haven't played with the Moz editor in a year or so, but from what I remember, it didn't suck.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yes, it is based on the Mozilla editor. But, from what I understand, this is not an official Mozilla project. It also includes some basic site managment tools that I believe are missing from the Mozilla &quot;whatever it is called.&quot;<br /><br />I will give a report in a few days when I get a couple of other projects out of the way.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This looks like it's going to be a kick-butt tool...Every time I went to conferences where Macromedia was at, my biggest complaint was when will the linux version of Dreamweaver be available... guess if you snooze you lose. :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here is my report on this software.<br /><br />I can't get it to run.<br /><br />I have downloaded the two precompiled versions I get different problems. From the debian/lindows version I get:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">./nvu-bin&#58; error while loading shared libraries&#58; libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3&#58; cannot open shared object file&#58; No such file or directory<br /></div><br />From the Fedora version I get:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">nsNativeComponentLoader&#58; GetFactory&#40;libwidget_gtk2.so&#41; Load FAILED with error&#58; /home/david/nvu-0.20/libgtkxtbin.so&#58; undefined symbol&#58; gdk_threads_lock<br /></div><br />I wanted to compile from source but you can only get the source from CVS. When running the cvs script I get:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">cvs checkout&#58; warning&#58; failed to open /home/david/.cvspass for reading&#58; No such file or directory<br /></div><br />From my reading i think this is caused because of not having a cvsroot defined. But I have not been able to determine how to do that. Also, it seems from my reading that you would only need to set a cvsroot if you are serving up files via cvs. <br /><br />Can someone give me a hint?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Talk about embarassing. I was looking for something complicated. :oops: <br /><br />Thanks Danc. I installed that and it took care of the problem. I am running Mandrake 10 (Community Edition). I have had some little problems with 10 CE along the way and assumed that that might be part of the problem. <br /><br />Thanks again.<br /><br />Now I will give a report on this in a few days.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: In my greatest intentions I</div><div class="quote">Now I will give a report on this in a few days.</div><br />It never happened. I tried it a few times, but was only interested in it when I was actually trying to get something done. A bad time to try software. I got frustrated with not being able to get it to do what I wanted.<br /><br />The software as a whole just does not have that much appeal to me. For the last 3 years, my website has been all about maintenance, not building. Therefore, editing the files in a text editor right on the server has worked for me. [DON'T do that! It is really stupid. No, really. Do you know how many times I have hosed a file and had to rebuild it from the start cause I didn't start with a backup?]</div>
