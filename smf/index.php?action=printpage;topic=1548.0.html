					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Heya, I'm running Slackware 9 with the 2.6.4 kernel. &nbsp;I'm having a rather strange problem here. &nbsp;Apparently my mount command for the CDROM isn't working right.<br /><br />I've tried mounting a floppy drive and it does just fine, but apparently mounting a CD is a problem. &nbsp;I slap the CD in the drive, type, &quot;mount /dev/cdrom&quot; and it tells me that it's not a valid block device.<br /><br />To my understanding I built ATAPI support into the kernel so I don't think that's it (though it could be, I dunno). &nbsp;Any ideas on what I'm doing wrong? &nbsp;I checked in the fstab and taht's how it's listed.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">/dev/cdrom is usually just a symbolic link to whatever ide or scsi device you are using is. Try /dev/hdc or /dev/hdd. Those are first and second device on the second ide channel.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay, here's the story.<br /><br />I've tried the /mnt/cdrom, no luck. &nbsp;My fstab still lists it and my symbolic link points to /dev/sr0. &nbsp;To add to the fun when I went back and ran kernel 2.4.22 (like I am now) I can mount and unmount the drive perfectly.<br /><br />So I'm assuming this means that SOMEHOW the drive got left out of the kernel...or something. &nbsp;Please tell me there's a way to rebuild the kernel WITHOUT having to go through ALL of the options over again. &nbsp;That was such a pain.<br /><br />And now that I think about it I'll have to go back and find out how I built the kernel before...ugh. &nbsp;Well, at least I've still got that stuff lying around somewhere.<br /><br /><br />I suppose I can fire it back up in 2.6.4 but I think the /dev entries stay the same. &nbsp;I think. &nbsp;I dunno, what do you all think?</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">/dev/sr0 is a dead give away. Either that drive is scsi or you are using IDE-SCSI emulation for some reason. Check your bootloader for any append statements to the effect of &quot;hdc=ide-scsi&quot;.<br /><br />In the 2.6 kernel, ide-scsi emulation is no longer necessary, so find out what the real device is and everything should be fine. You will need to update your fstab should you find the device is different now.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hmm, it's not SUPPOSED to be a SCSI drive and during the boot sequence it comes up easily as &quot;hdd: &nbsp;ATAPI CDRW&quot; or something to that effect. &nbsp;Anyway, since it's supposed to be an ATAPI CD-ROM what should I change to what?<br /><br />Interesting that it's using the IDE-SCSI emulation still. &nbsp;That must be why it's recognized in the 2.4.22 perfectly fine but not in the 2.6.4. &nbsp;Maybe I DID build the kernel right, I just needed to change how it found the drive afterward.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Edit your /etc/lilo.conf file, remove the lines &quot;append=hdd=ide-scsi&quot; if you have anything like that. &nbsp;Save the file, run &quot;lilo&quot; from the command line, reboot. &nbsp;Edit your cdrom symlink to point to the correct device:<br /><br />rm -f /dev/cdrom<br />ln -s /dev/hdd /dev/cdrom<br /><br />for example. &nbsp;Then you should be able to <br />mount /mnt/cdrom<br />as root.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hmm, sorry, it seems my ordeal isn't 100% over just yet, though definitely better.<br /><br />First, I can't seem to mount the CDROM as a regular user, only as root. &nbsp;Any way to change this? &nbsp;'Cause I've got to be honest, I don't want to have to su root every time I want to put a disc in the drive if at all possible (I know, I know...have your cake and eat it too).<br /><br />Second thing is a little strange. &nbsp;I can mount the Slackware installation CDs okay (only data CDs immediately handy) but I cannot mount an audio CD (tried mounting <i>Madonna</i>'s &quot;Music&quot; album). &nbsp;Could it be the disc, or will it require a different kind of setup to mount audio CDs than data CDs? &nbsp;I didn't think it would, but I guess I don't know too much about it.<br /><br />I was kinda hoping to be able to listen to CDs in KDE while programming though I think this is only one link in the chain 'cause KDE every once in awhile for no apparent reason comes back and tells me something about overloading an audio processor. &nbsp;Wish I could be more descriptive but I'll elaborate next time it comes up. &nbsp;I don't know if it affects music playback yet 'cause I need the CD working to test that. &nbsp;=P<br /><br /><br />Thanks again for your help, I know it's probably just something simple that I SHOULD know but don't.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">quick fix to the root only mounting is open your /etc/fstab and on the lines for your cdrom and floppy on the 4th column it probaly reads something like: noauto,owner,ro &nbsp;or something like that.....simple fix is change the word owner in that column to user so it would read like noauto,user,ro <br /><br />also about the audio cds.....it should mount em just like a normal data cd <br />possibly something in your kernel .config?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Good info in prev posts. i have similar prob using SuSE 9.1 Pro (KDE). &nbsp;Device shows up as /dev/cdrecorder/ i click or type in file search window and get error, not valid device or not eccessable. I know it works, i just used it to install new software using YaST. &nbsp;what if i just want to browse the contents in xterm??</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, you would have to mount it. Are you sure /dev/cdrecorder is the actual device? That sounds like it may be a symlink to something else. Try this command:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">ls -l /dev/cdrecorder</div><br />See if that shows you something like<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root &lt;date time&gt; /dev/cdrecorder -&gt; /dev/hdc</div><br />Whatever the -&gt; is pointing to is the actual device. If that isn't correct, then your problem may lie there. You may also want to check your fstab and see what devices are listed there.<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">less /etc/fstab</div><br />Look in there for any references to /dev/hdc or hdd or even possibly /dev/cdroms/cdrom0. I'm not quite sure how SuSE handles drives, but it can't be too wacky.<br /><br />If the device is right, check your mount options. It could be that you have something like supermount handling it for you, in which case you would just browse to the mount point which may be /mnt/cdrom or something to that affect. Typically, to mount a cd, you run this as root:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">mount -t iso9660 /dev/&lt;device file&gt; /mnt/&lt;some dir&gt;</div><br />Once it is mounted, you can look at the contents of the disc.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It looks like SuSE uses Submount for automounting it's removable media. You can find all of the documentation for Submount at the SourceForge site (http://submount.sourceforge.net). You may just have to throw a cd in the drive and browse /media/cdrecorder for it to mount the disc and go. That is my guess anyway.<br /><br />Device files should be files, not directories. File and directory attributes are the same with the exception of marking a directory as a such. You use the same attributes to each.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That's what submount is for. It handles the mounting automagically. You place the cd, floppy or flash drive in the system and when you try to access that mount point, it attempts to mount the filesystem. The same should be able to be done with any other type of filesystem to include network based ones like nfs or smbfs. The same goes for systems which utilize supermount instead of submount. I know supermount even has kernel ties to make it work.</div>
