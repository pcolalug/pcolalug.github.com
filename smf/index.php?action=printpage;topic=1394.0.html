					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">very cool<br /><br />I never really was interested in Unreal Tournament 2003 or Unreal 2, but I tried out UT2004 just to see if there was any graphics improvements and I like the game for most part....was fun to mess around with the vehicles like i used to do in battlefield 1942/dc<br /><br />only had one problem that really annoyed me but it probaly has to do with my monitor...... when I go into the game, all the menus run 60Hz Vert. refresh rate and I can't stand 75Hz or below and the game runs 60Hz even when I run 1024x768 resolution which is what I run for most of my other things and it runs 85Hz just fine....my video card and system can handle higher resolution but my monitor can't....but I do know for a fact that it should be running 85Hz when I'm running the game at 1024x768, but it's not and it's giving me a freakin headache<br /><br />also once I exit the game my entire desktop and everything is running 60Hz(resolution doesn't change but it switches to lowest refresh rate) and i have to restart xserver to get it back to 85Hz.....arg I wish I had an NEC multisync &nbsp;that could run about 2x these refresh rates...but guess gotta use what I got<br /><br />vid card is a gainward ultra750XP golden sample geforce 4 Ti4600 128mb, monitor is a kds Xflat 17&quot;.....running the latest nvidia drivers/glx(5336), 2.6.2 kernel, slack9.1<br /><br />anyone know whats up with this?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">ok I think i figured out the issue..... well atleast i got it to work on mine<br />I remembered how a buddy of mine in win used to edit his ini config files for ut2003 so I figured i'd take a peek and see if anything about refresh rates were mentioned in ANY of the .ini files of ut2004<br /><br />go to the directory where you installed ut2004demo, should be<br />/whatever.../ut2004/<br /><br />and in that directory, you will see the System directory, go in there, find Default.ini and open in a text editor<br /><br />ok now just do a find and search for Refresh<br />and it will come up with a few sections of DesiredRefreshRate=<br />and the value specified atleast on mine was 60 on a few sections, i changed that to 85<br />also make sure the section that is OverrideDesktopRefreshRate=False<br /><br />some of the sections for UT2004demo default.ini is for directx/directx9 it seems so i'm going to guess the same default.ini is used in win as whats in linux....I just changed all of the desired refresh rates to 85 because either way it's simple to change<br /><br />the only time I had it switch back to 60hz on me is when some stupid stats registration came up and it closed my UT2004 and loaded mozilla with some site about stats, when i went back into UT2004demo it was running 800x600 and 60Hz, changed resolution back to 1024x768, and when i exited it left my desktop at 60hz so had to fix desktop refresh and then went back into UT2004 demo and it was fine again at 85hz<br /><br />let me know if this works out for ya &nbsp;:wink: it seemed to work well for me</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Doesn't work for me, lloydr.<br /><br />However, I've found a fix for it that /did/ work. &nbsp;The refresh rate isn't determined by the game, it's controlled by your X configuration.<br /><br />Open up your /etc/X11/XF86Config (or XF86Config-4, depending on your distro)<br /><br />Find the section labeled &quot;Monitor&quot;<br /><br />There should be two lines here, something that reads like the following:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"> &nbsp; &nbsp;HorizSync &nbsp;30-95<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; VertRefresh 60-150<br /></div><br /><br /><br />The lowest number determines the absolute lowest refresh rate that your monitor can handle. &nbsp;Simply increase the lower boundry (don't push it past a point that your monitor cannot handle, though..) on both. &nbsp;Here's what mine looks like now:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"> &nbsp; &nbsp;HorizSync &nbsp;50-95<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; VertRefresh 85-150<br /></div><br /><br />Anyways, this is what works for me. I now have UT2k4 running at 85hz at 1024x768 resolution.</div>
