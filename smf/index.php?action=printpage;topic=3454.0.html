					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I sent an email to the media contact listed on the work email I got asking permission to pass out fliers, I work at the Northwest Florida State College, and have not received an answer. <br /><br />Could you send an official request to Carl Lofstrom, the president of NWFACUG ? There is a contact link at the bottom of the Expo page.<br /><br />I am going and will pass out fliers if we get permission.</div>

I too wrote them the other day and got a reply back this morning. Following is his reply in part:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Hi David,<br />I want to thank you for your email message. All of your members and others from your community are invited to attend our Computer Expo &#039;09 on Saturday,<br />January 24, 2009, Northwest Florida State College; Niceville, FL The event is free and open to the public. This is our third computer expo and this one will be the best ever with more workshops and more vendors.<br /><br />We have more than 22 workshops scheduled from 8:30 AM to 4:00 PM. Our presenters and vendors are very knowledgeable and experienced. You are more than welcomed to have someone come and setup a table (we provide tables for free) and give out handouts and have a laptop to demo the software. If they elect to attend workshops, they can leave the handouts on the table but try to be present from 12:00 noon to 1:00 PM. They can bring some copies of Kubuntu and add them to the door prizes to help get some recognition for the Pensacola Linux User&#039;s Group. <br /><br />We have one more room available if you have a person who would like to make a presentation on Ubuntu or Kubuntu and the related open source software. The time slot we have available is from 9:45 AM to 10:45 AM Bldg K, Room 151. The room comes with a projector and screen. Let me know as soon as possible to get the name and brief description added to the schedule of events. <br /><br />...The drive from Pensacola on Interstate I10 down Highway 85 to the college is about one hour....<br /><br />Many thanks and hope to see at least 25 from your club in attendance.<br /></div><br />I will contact him and let him know that we definitely want a table to set up a station with fliers. Do you have something already printed up mall0ry? Do you want to work with the flier we had from one of our previous events?<br /><br />Who else can go?<br /><br />Can anyone put together a presentation that would make us all proud? I would suggest something newbie friendly. We don&#039;t want to scare them off. It could be advanced stuff too as long as there is some pretty good WOW! factor built in. Give them a reason to have an interest in Linux. <br /><br />How I wished I could be there for that.</div>

Are the fliers already printed? We need to work out how I can get the fliers if no one is coming from that way.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />George</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">None printed yet. Here is a link to a previous flier. Modify it however you see fit.<br /><br />http://members.cox.net/danc3/pics/PLUG_flyer3.odt<br /><br />The paper, as is, is appropriate. If you see any changes that need to be made you can do so. Or, if you want to shrink it down to being a half page to maximize the number you can get you, then feel free.<br /><br />Anyone else able to go?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">LOL, I find it interesting that the email response indicates that it would be acceptable to give a presentation on Ubuntu/Kubuntu, as if those are the very definition of &quot;Linux&quot;.&nbsp; I guess the marketing strategies do work to some extent.<br /><br />I was actually thinking about attending this, but after further review of their site, everything is Windows-centric, other than the single Ubuntu event.&nbsp; It also looks as if an AARP card may be required to gain entry, and I don&#039;t have one of those.&nbsp; &nbsp;:D<br /><br />Dan<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I got an email from the man in charge over there. He thanked me today for having someone there.<br /><br />Here is part of the message:<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">We all want to thank you for your support. We had 251 computer users attend<br />Expo &#039;09. This was our 3rd expo and considered the most successful one to<br />date. We had more vendor support, more presenters and more participants. Now<br />that we know, you are active in Pensacola we will have to come and visit one<br />of your future meetings. Just maybe Pensacola user groups will sponsor a<br />computer expo in the near future.</div><br />I am glad it all went well.</div>
