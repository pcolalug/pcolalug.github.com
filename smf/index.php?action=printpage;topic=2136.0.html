					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I got an HP LaserJet 1160 (http://www.shopping.hp.com/cgi-bin/hpdirect/shopping/scripts/product_detail/product_detail_view.jsp?BV_SessionID=@@@@1153255239.1103863256@@@@&amp;BV_EngineID=ccfeadddgkmhkgjcfngcfkmdfondfgf.0&amp;landing=printers&amp;category=laserjets_bw&amp;subcat1=entry_level&amp;product_code=Q5933A%23ABA&amp;catLevel=3) for (early) Christmas. <br /><br />(http://images10.newegg.com/productimage/28-104-337-01.JPG)<br /><br />I'm wanting to get a good network print server for it and I don't want to spend a whole lot of money on it. The printer works with PCL 5e and I plan to use it on my linux, solaris and windows boxes. Does anyone have any suggestions for a good network print server that supports TCP/IP printing and DHCP, USB and 10/100 network. SMB would be kind of nice too. Since the printer does have parallel, I would be willing to get one of those super cool print servers that plug directly into the centronics port on the back.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm using a Linksys print server: &nbsp;http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?grid=34&amp;scid=32&amp;prid=437<br />and I'm very happy with it. &nbsp;I have a HP LaserJet 5L and a HP DeskJet 712C hooked to it, and both work perfectly. &nbsp;I set them up in CUPS with no problems. &nbsp;It also works fine with my wife and kid's Windows machines.<br /><br />Not sure what it costs, as I bought mine (which actually looks a little different but has same model number, it's 5 years old) at a garage sale for $10. &nbsp;It does not have USB connections, just 3 parallel ports and an ethernet port.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You got a steal on that. The cheapest price on pricewatch is $123.00.<br /><br />I'm thinking about the D-Link DP-301P+ (http://www.dlink.com/products/?sec=0&amp;pid=322) which is $52 at NewEgg. The thing I like about it is that it plugs directly into the centronics port on the printer and then the LAN plugs into it. If I don't have to add any extra cables into my rat's nest, I would be too happy. <br /><br />(http://ftp://ftp10.dlink.com/images/products/DP-301P+/DP-301P+.jpg)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I figured out which one to get. It ended up being the Zonet ZPS3601 (http://www.zonetusa.com/DispProduct.asp?ProductID=99).<br /><br />(http://images10.newegg.com/productimage/33-130-015-02.JPG)<br /><br />The feature list is impressive and the price was pretty nice at NewEgg. I'm excited.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay, I just wanted to give you guys an update. I've got the printer setup and the print server is working. I'm now printing across the network from my Windows machines. The initial setup of the print server was a little odd since the default IP was set to 10.0.0.1. At first, it was also trying to act as a DHCP server when I already have one on my network. After disabling that, I decided to give it a static IP for ease of administration across the network. Thinking back, I probably should have setup the various printing settings on the clients by hostname rather than IP since I plan to change my IP scheme soon. Oh well. Now I'm emerging ESP Ghostscript which will work with CUPS for my linux printing. Once the Sun box comes in, I'll get to learn the way it handles printing as well. So far, though, this is coming along quite nicely. Here are a couple of pictures...<br /><br />Printer<br />(http://members.cox.net/dgivens4/printer.jpg)<br /><br />Print Server<br />(http://members.cox.net/dgivens4/print-server.jpg)<br /><br />Update: I had to install CUPS, foomatic, hpijs and ghostscript, but once those were all installed, I did the whole Add Printer in the CUPS web admin and I just printed a test page. How cool is that?<br /><br />Since I run command line, I figured out how print files and such from the there with the command lp. Basically I do this<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">lp &lt;filename&gt;</div><br />and it prints that file. I dig it...a lot.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: rburt3</div><div class="quote">Can you config this little gem from a Linux machine?</div><br /><br />Of course you can! To initially configure it, you just need to plug it all up to your switch and then assign an IP such as 10.0.0.2 to your nic and then point your browser to http://10.0.0.1/. It's very simple from there. The web interface is very basic. You have to turn off the DHCP server that is setup to run by factory settings if you are using another. <br /><br />Best bet is to assign the puppy a static IP outside of your DHCP scope for your internal network since there is no way to make it automatigically update DNS due to it's somewhat feature-lacking DHCP client. Ho-hum, but it works. What I would recommend is to give the static IP a DNS entry (if you have an internal DNS server...and what self respecting Linux user doesn't) and use that DNS name for all of your configs. That way, if you ever change the IP of the print server, you simply update the A record in your DNS server and all of your clients are back to using the right IP for the printer. Imagine having to change 5 or more IPs for TCP/IP printer sockets in CUPS and any other clients you may have.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks! Gonna look this one up on newegg tonight. Oh, btw, I finally broke down and bought a WRT54G. Crap-a WRK was just making me ill. Does that rom image you use have a DNS on it?</div>

You can't put a zonefile in there, but running bind is really easy on any linux box. You can also setup DHCP on the router to assign the dns server you setup on your internal network.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">...aaaannnd you've lost the programmer. Can I set it up so that it resolves the computer names for the internal boxen but also provides the DNS that my provider configures with the lease?</div>
