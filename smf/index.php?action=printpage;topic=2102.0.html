					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I know, it's not Linux it's Unix, but I'm deciding to humor someone I know (I'd like to call him a friend but for the last month straight he's been a real ****) and give FreeBSD a whirl. &nbsp;I just so happen to have a spare machine now (got it for free...where was it when I was thinking of setting up smoothwall?) that I can abuse to my heart's content.<br /><br />Given that I'll be running FreeBSD on an older box (800Mhz for relative age idea) and I figured I'd ask you all about your thoughts and opinions as Linux users about FreeBSD.<br /><br /><br />My thoughts? &nbsp;FreeBSD is not inferior, outdated, &quot;wrong,&quot; or anything else, but I also just can't call it &quot;superior,&quot; &quot;More secure,&quot; &quot;better,&quot; or anything else, I just typically don't run into a real need to use something other than Linux and I like the design philosophy (chaos) of Linux.<br /><br />My only beef with FreeBSD is the FreeBSD users. &nbsp;While I know there's probably a decent amount of Linux users that troll Windows I've never run into any personally (only if someone wants to start comparing the two do the &quot;comparisons&quot; come out) but with BSD users I never seem to be able to talk with one for more than five minutes before they start telling me about how &quot;inferior&quot; Linux is when we aren't even talking about OSes (cars, movies, games, and things not related). &nbsp; :roll: <br /><br />Anyway, figured I'd run it and see it firsthand. &nbsp;I'm expecting something a little different but not anything I haven't seen before, really. &nbsp;Any thoughts?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Personally, I dual-boot Slackware Linux with FreeBSD. You are right, neither one is superior--they are just different. I like them both. Now, I will say that FreeBSD users may feel superior to Linux users because most Linux distros like Fedora, Mandrake and Suse do a lot of the work for you. With FreeBSD, or even Gentoo and Slackware, you don't get a pretty interface for installation, nor a wizard to configure everything. With FreeBSD, Slack and Gentoo, the user must edit everything by hand, which is one reason why those users have a superiority complex. The more I mess with BSD, the more I feel that Linux is trying to hard to be like Windows. The more it tries to be like Windows, the more Windows-like security holes I think will develop. Now, if users of the &quot;more Windows-like distros&quot; harden their systems, that's fine. I have run a port scan on the default Fedora installation, the default Slack installation, and default FreeBSD installation--there is a difference. Fedora/Suse/Mandrake users need to harden their systems so that BSD users can not use security as an issue to argue superiority.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I also really like FreeBSD, especially since it was my introduction to OSS (I was blown away with Gnome + Enlightenment which, in retrospect was impressively more stable and predictable on FreeBSD that in Linux at the time). Its solid and stable with all of the Unix-y goodness I like. <br /><br />I think, as you folks seem to, that a debate on which one, Linux or *BSD is fruitless and depends highly on what you want to do with it. I think Linux is a better desktop, while FreeBSD makes a better server, especially for availablity and predictability dependent services. OpenBSD, on the otherhand is my edge device OS of choice. Linux can do all of these things and do them well, but how things work out for you depend a lot on your experience with the technology.<br /><br />As for the respective communities, I've found that there are a lot of users in all camps that have a chip on their shoulder about some other competitor. Linux users slam Windows; FreeBSD users slam Linux; OpenBSD users slam everyone. Its just what happens when people choose a group to identify with and want to justify their choices. Personally, I've found places in these communities that are fairly free of noise and really accomodating and helpful. That being said, you will get a lot more resistence from the *BSD community if you haven't done your homework first (RTF(ine)M) than you would in many Linux communities.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I find it interesting you mention the community response, rburt, because it just so happens I was reading up on a very possible reason for this.<br /><br /><br />Apparently when questions and development were done mainly by newsgroups ([edit]darn[/edit], I hope that's the right term it's been so long...it's like a mailing list with alt.whatever.com) Linux has always had, just like its design methodology, lots of different ones for all sorts of different questions so it wasn't hard to find one for newbies to ask newbie questions.<br /><br />&quot;Apparently,&quot; the BSDs, like their design philosophy, had more of a unified newsgroup environment where all questions about everything were compiled into just a handful. &nbsp;Thus, newbies asking newbie questions were confronted with hardcore developers and that can get pretty irritating pretty quick.<br /><br /><br />But this is just what I've read. &nbsp;I find I like some of the things in *BSD but something seems &quot;strange&quot; about it for desktop use. &nbsp;I just can't put my finger on what it is, but it seems more cut out for high-volume server use. &nbsp;I just wish I knew what it was that makes me like Linux more (it's not that it's pure Unix 'cause I love Unix...I just Linux's version better).<br /><br /><br /><br />Interestingly enough, I've heard that Linux's greatest strength over BSD is its almost totally chaotic nature. &nbsp;The way a particular BSD user put it was that BSD already knows where it wants to be and is taking its time getting there. &nbsp;Linux on the other hand doesn't really know and so it's willing to go in every direction at once, trying everything to see just where it's going and where it fits in. &nbsp;While this means it will have many pitfalls, it will also discover many strengths.<br /><br />I kind of like that.<br /><br />[moderated 2:26PM CST 12/21/2004 by Rugmonster due to profanity in body]</div>
