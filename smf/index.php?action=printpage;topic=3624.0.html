					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Today I read about key touch and key touch editor. I had bought my wife a new Toshiba E105-S1802 laptop. It has touch keys on the right side of the keyboard for the multimedia which didn&#039;t work with linux. PCLinuxOS is what is on it. I installed the two programs and ran Key Touch. My keyboard was not listed so I had to run the editor and make a file of the keyboard to import into Key Touch.&nbsp; To my surprise the editor recognized everyone of the multimedia keys and I saved the file, imported it into Key Touch and applied it and all the keys are working. If you have a keyboard or laptop with keys that don&#039;t work in linux give these programs a try. I tell you KDE4 in PCLinuxOS running on this new laptop, dual core AMD, 4 gb ram and 500gb hard drive makes one fine machine now that all the keys work. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for the review of the software. I have a keyboard on my desktop that has all those fancy keys that I have never tried mapping. Come to think of it, my notebook has them too. I may try doing something with them.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I used to have to map the multimedia keys on my Dell E1505, but PCLinuxOS 2007, and eventually Ubuntu, began recognizing them by default.&nbsp; Before that though I had to use xbindkeys I think it was to configure them.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am the type that I never use them so I never map them... although i noticed the newer Ubuntu releases allows them to work by default which I was not expecting... until my 2 year old started mashing buttons and opened my home page, opened thunderbird and then out my system to sleep lol</div>
