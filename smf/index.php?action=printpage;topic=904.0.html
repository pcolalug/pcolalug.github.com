					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I was just saying hi and let everyone know there is a new user. &nbsp;I just recently picked up Linux. &nbsp;I am currently running Mandrake 9.1. &nbsp;I am new to Linux and so far I like it but have querks about it. &nbsp;I also use windows but mainly for my games and apps for burning DVD's. &nbsp;I just decided to give Linux a fair shot and Completely took windows off both my computers and forced myself to use nothing but Linux. &nbsp;For the most part things worked but then somethings didnt. &nbsp;I would really like to learn more and also meet people that share in the common interest of Linux. &nbsp;Thats all for now.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Nothing like going head first into a project!<br /><br />Welcome.<br /><br />I recommend the K3B burning program on 9.1. It took a while to learn K3B, but once I did, it has certainly been a nice program. Especially considering the days when burning via command line was easier than the GUI tools available (Mandrake 9.0).</div>
