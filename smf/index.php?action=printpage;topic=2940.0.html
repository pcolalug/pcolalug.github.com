					Title: <b>Windows and Linux on the Server Side</b><br />
					Post by: <b>rugmonster</b> on <b>July 25, 2006, 10:28:27 am</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">An article (http://searchopensource.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid39_gci1203690,00.html) I read today sparked an idea for a good debate. Here&#039;s the abstract:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Not long ago, choosing Linux in the data center meant a tradeoff. You had to give up some capabilities in exchange for freedom from Microsoft lock-in. But that has changed. These days the features of Windows and Linux stack up against each other very competitively. For the most part, administrators can choose Linux or Windows today without losing out. Some differences, however, must be considered. In this article, I look at several of those differences</div><br />Look it over. What are your thoughts?<br /><br />Here are my thoughts...<br />Management - I have not seen the commercial linux management tools, but I&#039;ve not been impressed by webmin. The seperate tools such as SWAT for Samba and the CUPS admin seem to do a good job. All in all though, good centralized management is definitely hard to find and is definitely not free under linux. I would say though, Windows does not provide a complete management experience either. There are still third party or additional apps that are necessary to accomplish full system management of an enterprise environment (SMS, SNMP Managers, etc). All in all, I would say with the proper smarts and upfront time investment, you could set up a more efficient Linux environment requiring less administration for the life of a network.<br /><br />Costs and Support - I think there is more free support and better documentation available for the Linux world than there is for the Windows world simply due to the community. This comes at a price of time to sort through it all. A good admin will pick up things are require less time to find information in the future and the simple fact that once Linux stuff is up, it pretty much stays up with the exception of hardware failure (opposed to Windows which I can say does not live up to as well as Linux does). <br /><br />Hardware Support - Increasingly Linux is supporting more and more hardware and great strides have been made to support more enterprise level hardware. More hardware is included with the Linux kernel than you find in the Windows default install. How often do you have to load disk controller drivers to support your SATA or RAID controller when loading Windows? A whole lot more than with modern Linux distros.<br /><br />Now, your thoughts.<br /></div>
