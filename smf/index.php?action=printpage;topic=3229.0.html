					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello Forum,<br /><br />I am totally new to Linux, and this is also to be interpreted as never used or seen Linux in action on my PC or other machines.&nbsp; This is my dilemma and I am hoping that picking the brains of the more experienced forum members will enable me to become proficient at using Linux based OS.&nbsp; My intent is to place Gentoo on my PS3 to run applications and enhance my $1000 toy.&nbsp; However if I become comfortable enough using Linux then I plan to move totally away from Windows.&nbsp; So I look forward to talking to the forum in the future and all I ask is that with any newbie is to be patient as it really is all Greek to me.&nbsp; If there is any advice as to where to start &quot;Linux for Dummies&quot;, or like sources it would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; In addition to that if there is anyone on the forum that has time to possibly assist me in placing Gentoo on my PS3 I would be more than happy to pay for that person&#039;s expertise in assisting me to do so.&nbsp; If that is something that can be done please email me at aeh21082@yahoo.com.&nbsp; Again thank you and I look forward to talking to the forum in the near future.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Putting Linux on a PS3 isn&#039;t the best experience to have with Linux as the PS3 has really weird hardware and it&#039;s difficult to find good drivers for it.&nbsp; It works but it&#039;s slow.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Whatever you decide to do, don&#039;t judge all Linux by your experience with the project. What you are wanting to do is not for the casual user. That is some more advanced stuff.<br /><br />I hope it works great for you, if not though, give Ubuntu on a regular computer a try before you think all Linux is as hard to install as Gentoo on a PS3.</div>
