					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi all,<br /><br />For you ET players... &nbsp;there is an update patch out. &nbsp;You can get it here:<br /><br />http://www.rtcwfiles.com/sort.files?game=WET&amp;cat=2668&amp;ref=2665<br /><br />I also uploaded it to the /incoming directory on Jesse's ftp server...<br /><br />It fixes some bugs, and should be applied. &nbsp;The patched client won't talk to an unpatched server...<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'll make an effort to get on this Thursday. Now that I've stopped playing Shadowbane, my life is once again returning to normal. Sorry for flaking out for the past few weeks.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Checked it out and it's still cycling through the areas. I'm stoked 'cause now I can run ET in 1024x768 - Got a new NVidia FX5600 w/256meg for my b-day.... Jealous yet? &nbsp;:twisted: <br /><br />I'll be around tomorrow night about 8, so if there are problems, give me a shout.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Jesse,<br /><br />As of 4pm Thursday, still can't connect to the server. &nbsp;Actually what I mean is: &nbsp;I can &quot;connect&quot;, but can't join the server. &nbsp;Getting a message saying that the server and my game are running incompatible versions of the game. &nbsp;<br /><br />I'm running the patched (1.02) version, and it seems the patch hasn't been applied to the server yet... &nbsp;Until it is, only old versions (unpatched) of the game will be able to connect...<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just ssh'd to the server. Doesn't look like Jesse has had a chance to patch it yet, and I gotta run. I think we're going to move ET to another box (I need the current one for my son) next week sometime. I'll make sure it is patched by then. Sorry for the delays.<br /><br />BTW, Dan, is Narsil still running a Teamspeak server and is it something everyone playing can use and still keep the teams on separate channels?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sorry, couldn't make it tonight. Got 3/4 of the way through the download and the DSL connection trashed out. Will try and get it and be on next week.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I was there, kinda. Took me 20 minutes to get the patch installed. Over an hour to download (some of) the new maps. I finally gave up trying to get on about 9:45. But I tried.<br /><br />I had no idea that there would be so much to download. Getting set up 5 minutes before game time just did not work for me. Maybe next week.</div>
