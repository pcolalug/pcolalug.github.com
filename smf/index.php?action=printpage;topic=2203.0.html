					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I thought I would take a moment to haep my praise upon a wireless app I am currently using. Kismet what a great tool for monitoring wireless access points hooked with airsnort and the kismet log viewer which takes the ugly xml files and renders nice html webpages of your captured data inputing the &nbsp;airsnort info also. was a little difficult to get running and had to write a script &nbsp;to run the log viewers many parts as one function, but it is up and running and loving it. also downloaded some sounds and wav files for it so it tels me &nbsp;if the wap is encrypt or not and a few aother key things.<br />Worth your time to download and setup if you are using wireless.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">How can I check if my wireless card supports raw monitoring (rfmon). &nbsp;Since it is a built in wireless on my toshiba laptop I dont have &nbsp;specific card info. &nbsp;I use the orinoco drivers and it works fine. &nbsp;I am researching the error right now.<br />Also, how can I check which version of the orinoco driver I am using?<br /><br />I think this is the problem but I dont know exactly how to fix it.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote"><br /><br /># A common problem I am hearing about is people installing pcmcia-cs when they already have kernel pcmcia built in. The problem is that the orinoco drivers for kernel pcmcia install to a different location than the orinoco drivers for pcmcia-cs. This often results in two sets of drivers being present after doing a make install on the pcmcia-cs sources. The problem is that the patched version of the orinoco drivers will not be used, rather the old unpatched drivers get loaded and you will be led to believe that the patch has failed. Make sure that you do not have more than one copy of hermes.o, orinoco.o and orinoco_cs.o in your /lib/modules/&lt;kernel&gt; subtree. Test that you are actually using patched drivers with the following:<br /><br />iwpriv eth0<br /><br />If you do not see &quot;monitor&quot; listed as the last available private ioctl, then you are not using patched drivers. Remove any old drivers that you find per the instructions above.<br /><br /># You must be configured to use the orinoco_cs driver. NOT the wvlan_cs or wavelan_cs drivers.</div><br /><br />Well maybe it isnt the problem, I do not see monitor listed when I run that command but when I run the lsmod command I see orinoco_cs listed.<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">linux&#58;/home/lee # lsmod<br />Module &nbsp;
