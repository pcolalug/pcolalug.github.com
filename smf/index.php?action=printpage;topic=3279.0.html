					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay, the K12LTSP server for Camp Fire USA is up and running.&nbsp; I downloaded and burned the 6 CD&#039;s for K12LTSP 6.0.&nbsp; I ran into several problems of my own making that took me a while to figure out.&nbsp; Apparently, I turned off a few services that are needed by LTS.&nbsp; Anyway, finally got past those problems.<br /><br />To perform a basic test, I used my home computer as a client.&nbsp; It is PXE enabled, so I didn&#039;t need to make a floppy boot disk.&nbsp; The client booted across the network from the LTS.&nbsp; Currently, I am using the client to post this message.<br /><br />Sometime next week, I will try to boot the Camp Fire client using an etherboot floppy, which I still need to create.&nbsp; Once I get that to work, I will create copies of the boot floppy.&nbsp; I wish the clients were PXE enabled, it would simplify things, but we have to work with what we have.&nbsp; Also, I need to try and setup network printing and sound.&nbsp; Lucky me.<br /><br />A few things to think about:<br />- On the client machines, we probably should either remove the hard drives, or at least disconnect the cables.<br /><br />- If the kids are going to be able to save their files on the server, then they probably should have their own user id&#039;s.&nbsp; Of couse, this adds administration overhead.&nbsp; If we use generic user id&#039;s, like user1, user2, etc., then the kids won&#039;t be able to save files that only they can access.&nbsp; Also, is there a way for the kids to use the clients without requiring a user id and password?&nbsp; Of course, this eliminates the possibility of saving personal files.<br /><br />- Just a reminder that the server can use more memory, if anyone has some extra.&nbsp; Also, we need a switch.<br /><br />- Need to think about the best ways to lockdown aspiring hackers.<br /><br />- Need to filter internet content for inappropriate material.<br /><br />- Need to setup the firewall.<br /><br />- Other ideas?<br /><br />It was great working with you guys today.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The filter could be accomplished by using open dns. There is an option in there. Besides it is quicker than my default anyway.<br /><br />I mean if they know enough to get the ip address of a porno site, your probably not gonna stop them anyway.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have the switch laying around here and we will get the connection to the back room!<br />Also I think the clients had the pxe option in the menu may want to check the bios!!<br />That would be great if that worked.<br /><br />Anyway let me know how the printer is going with the setup.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi djoed_pcola, You may already know all this but if you will hit the del key on boot up and go into the bios and under the boot section change the 1st boot device to MBA UNDI it will try to boot PXE. Hope this helps.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks, Ed.<br /><br />Looks like the BIOS supports PXE booting, but the NIC doesn&#039;t.&nbsp; Looks like I&#039;ll have to create an etherboot floppy after all.&nbsp; I probably won&#039;t get to it tonight though.<br /><br />Later.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have a k12lstp 6.0 server running on a duron 1.3 with 512mb and 1 client a gateway from campfireusa. It is connecting through the nic by PXE. It took more ram than the 64mb we put in the computers. I had to put in a 128mb (smallest I had since I use my 64mb in it already) to get it to load the xserver. The sound is not working yet. I have never used gnome which I like very much but can&#039;t find out how to shutdown the client. I can only logout and then it goes back to the login screen. I have lots of questions, maybe I find so answers that fix them questions soon. Overall I am liking K12LSTP. I hope it will fit our needs but that remains to be seen.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">wow the needed additional 64 mb per machine may be a problem!<br /><br />I will see what I can get before Christmas this is going to get awkward in a hurry. Might need to look into stand alone distros to get them up than can run some sort of x in 64 mb of ram just in case!!<br /><br />possible solutions all education based<br /><br />http://www.skolelinux.org/ (http://www.skolelinux.org/)<br />http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-jr/ (http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-jr/)<br /></div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That 128 MB requirement Ed experienced just doesn&#039;t make sense.&nbsp; When I previously experimented with K12LTSP, I had clients connected with only 32 MB of memory.&nbsp; Perhaps there is a LTS server configuration that will allow us to lower the memory footprint.&nbsp; A thin-client should be thin, in my way of thinking.<br /><br />I brought the memory of the Camp Fire client I&#039;m testing up to 128 MB, but the client tries PXE booting and then hangs somewhere in the boot process.&nbsp; I need to research some more.&nbsp; I am able to PXE boot two of my own computers into K12LTSP, so I know the server is up and running.<br /><br />The NIC my client has is a 3Com C905C TXM.&nbsp; Ed, is that the same NIC your client has?<br /><br />&nbsp; </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi Brett, It is not as bad as it sounds. We have 64 megs in each of the 12 computers. If we take 64 mb out of half the computers and put them in the other half we will need to come up with 6 128 mb sticks. I will donate a stick and that leaves 5. If 5 other people step up and donate a stick we will have it for the clients I don&#039;t know about the server ram. Now the next thing is to get the sound working. I am hoping to talk to Dennis and anyone else that can help us resolve that problem. As I see it the sound is the main problem also all the nic&#039;s are not PXE capable but that is fixed with a floppy. I hate to have a floppy since the children can remove them but we have to work with what we have.<br /><br />Dennis, It might be less than 128 but it is more than 64mb. I had 64mb installed and it would not load. I did a Ctrl+Alt+F2 to a shell screen and looked at the xorg.log and it said it didn&#039;t have enough memory to load. I stuck the smallest stick I had a 128 mb stick in and turned it on and it booted up and brought up the xserver and login screen without any other changes.</div>

The printer was a formatting issue and the fax she fixed by changing settings. The electrical plug problem was a bad surge protector I think anyway after I replaced it she had not more power blips. That light switch in the classroom needs to be fixed by Thursday afternoon. I told her if you didn&#039;t get by there Wednesday I will change it out Thursday morning. She has a meeting between 10am and noon Wednesday and the place will be locked up. If you would rather me just fix it please let me know tonight.<br /></div>

If not I will at least drop off switches and plates there are three switches and 4 plates.<br />the 2 switches in learning room and 1 in her office and the face plate in the bathroom that I hung light. I should be able to get it but not sure right now! Also I went by today and thanks Ed for getting by there.

The K12LTSP works fine with my own personal computers, but I cannot get the client I brought home with me to boot.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried both PXE booting, and booting with a floppy that contained the appropriate NIC bootup software.&nbsp; The client seems to get most of the way thru the boot process, and then hangs.<br /><br />2. I downloaded the Edubuntu LTS CD&#039;s and installed on a spare computer.&nbsp; Again, both of my home computers boot fine using PXE, but the Camp Fire client hangs.&nbsp; With Ebuntu LTS, networked sound worked &quot;out of the box&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />3. For one and two above, I brought the client up to 256 MB of RAM.&nbsp; The Camp Fire client will just not boot for me.&nbsp; I&#039;m almost ready to promote it to my boat anchor.<br /><br />4. The next time we get together, I think I will bring my Edubuntu server along with the K12LTSP server.&nbsp; We can try some of the other clients to see what kind of results we get booting from each server.<br /><br />5. If anyone has any ideas why this client won&#039;t boot, I&#039;m open to suggestions.&nbsp; I&#039;ve poked around in the LTS documentation but haven&#039;t come across anything that helps.<br /><br />Ed, I apologize I haven&#039;t had a chance to call you yet.&nbsp; I did receive your pm.&nbsp; This week has been a blur so far.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I just dusted off an old IBM P166 with 64 MB of RAM and it booted over the network into K12LTS just fine.&nbsp; I&#039;m really not sure why the Camp Fire client I brought home won&#039;t boot over the network.<br /><br />Has anyone come up with some more RAM for the K12LTS server?<br /><br />Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to all fellow LUG members and lurkers out there.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Dennis, I feel your pain. I could never get sound with K12LTSP so I installed Edubuntu and could not get the client to boot all the way to a login screen. It also did not have all the software than K12LTSP comes with although it may be available for installation. I reinstalled K12LTSP last night so I will start on the sound problem again. I also noticed that the game childsplay has a good number and letters game. It is call findsound2 trouble is that it only works on the server and just flashes up on the client. The other modules in childsplay work fine minus the sound of course. I would like to appeal to anyone who knows how to setup a thin client network to please lend a hand. The is my first experience with it and am at a loss about the sound.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ed,<br /><br />Here are a couple of ideas that might help in case you haven&#039;t already tried them:<br /><br />1. Check the lts.conf file located in /opt/ltsp/i386/etc directory.&nbsp; There should be an entry as follows:<br />SOUND = Y<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Try one of your own machines as a client.&nbsp; With my own pc as a client, the sound worked with Edbuntu.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t tried that computer with K12LTSP.&nbsp; The P166 client I&#039;m currently using with K12LTS doesn&#039;t have a sound card.&nbsp; Perhaps there is some incompatibility issue with these Camp Fire sound cards<br /><br />3. You have probably already tried this, but if you haven&#039;t, go into System &gt; Administration &gt; Soundcard Detection and follow the instructions.<br /><br />If we can&#039;t get all the issues resolved we may just have to load a stand alone distro on each Camp Fire computer.&nbsp; However, I really hope with can make the LTS approach work.<br /><br />Well, I need to go do some last minute desperate Christmas shopping for the wife.<br /><br />Good luck.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi Dennis, I do have SOUND=Y and the sound daemon is nasd. By running childsplay from the command line on the client I found that if childsplay can&#039;t find a working sound card it aborts on purpose on those plugins (games) listed in my last post. I have been reading a 60 page pdf on LTSP so maybe I&#039;ll learn what to do to fix the sound. I really like K12LTSP and would love for it to work for us. Oh by the way the sound card I have in the gateway client is a SB Live CT4870 and it uses emu10k1. I put enough memory in it to run pclinuxos and it works with it. I also change it out for another sb live sound card and that one didn&#039;t work with K12ltsp either. May be just a matter of getting it to load the right driver with a custom client configuration file. Merry CHRISTmass to everybody.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am happy to report I finally got sound working on the Campfire client machine with K12LTSP. Google is your friend. After much googling I found a post that said to make this change in<br />/opt/ltsp/i386/etc/rc.sound go to line 67 which looks like this <br />/bin/esd -nobeeps -tcp -port 16001 -as 1 &amp;<br /><br />and make it look like this<br />/bin/esd -nobeeps -tcp -port 16001 -as 1 -public &amp;<br /><br />Using the ESD sound server sound now works for me on the client. There is still much work to be done. Right Dennis? I am doing the install on my test computer to learn. The real work is being done by Dennis on the real server.</div>

Let me know how this works for you guys right now I have the hub, but no takers for the ram so I am guessiing we will rob peter to pay paul this will atleast get them 6 computers going till I acquire more ram. Also there will be one admin account and&nbsp; 1 student account for all access. Not seperate passwords for each. If there are things we are still having problems with please let me know so I can address them. Thanks guys for all the hard work on this project and I know they&nbsp; appreciate it also.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay, if any of you geniuses know how to configure K12LTSP for auto login, I&#039;m open for ideas.&nbsp; So far, I haven&#039;t been able to figure it out, despite reading way too much documentation and hours of googling.&nbsp; Still need to get sound to work also.<br /><br />Network printing is now working for the Camp Fire server.<br /><br />Thanks for any ideas.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Does it use XDM or KDM? I believe both of them can be configured for convenience login, so that all the user has to do is click their face icon or hit enter (passwordless).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">K12LTSP uses Gnome.<br /><br />I need to figure out how to make each workstation automatically logon after booting.&nbsp; According to the Linux Terminal Server documentation, http://www.ltsp.org (http://www.ltsp.org), each thin-client wokstation is assigned a unique id starting with ws001.&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking we could create user id&#039;s on the server that match each workstation id.&nbsp; Then, after each client boots it could run a script to determine it&#039;s workstation id and then pass the ws id to an automatic logon script.&nbsp; <br /><br />I just can&#039;t figure out the details on how to actually make the automatic logon happen.&nbsp; This may require some custom bash script creation, but one problem is determining where the script(s) should reside and when they should be launched.&nbsp; However, it is highly preferable that auto-logon be accomplished without any custom scripts.<br /><br />Still open for ideas.<br /><br />Happy New Year to all.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think we should avoid using MAC address since if a client has to be swapped out later, someone will have to update the lts.conf file with the new client&#039;s MAC address.&nbsp; Just my opinion, but if you can figure out how to auto-logon using the mac, then perhaps that is our solution.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Dennis I found this on google. It is for K12LTSP 6.0 only so it should work for us.<br /><br />If you want all your clients to auto-login, create the&nbsp; <br />/usr/local/bin/autologin script so that all workstations get assigned an&nbsp; <br />autologin ID, like so:&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />#!/bin/bash&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;CLIENT=$(echo $DISPLAY | cut -d. -f1)&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;case &quot;$CLIENT&quot; in&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;ws001&quot;)&nbsp; &nbsp; disp=auto1;;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;ws002&quot;)&nbsp; &nbsp; disp=auto2;;&nbsp; <br /># repeat this for all ws numbers listed in /etc/hosts&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;ws253&quot;)&nbsp; &nbsp; disp=auto253;;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;esac&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;echo $disp&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Then, create logins IDs auto1 through auto253.&nbsp; That way, no matter what&nbsp; <br />address a client machine gets, autologin will work, and you don&#039;t have&nbsp; <br />to specify MAC addresses in dhcpd.conf.&nbsp; You do not have to create&nbsp; <br />passwords for the login IDs, but if you don&#039;t, be sure to turn off the&nbsp; <br />password requirement in the screensaver or users won&#039;t be able to get&nbsp; <br />back in once the screensaver kicks in. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi Dennis, I am happy to report I have autologin working on my client. I can&#039;t get it to login quicker that 5 seconds but that may be fast enough. The script default was 30 seconds and I changed it to 5 seconds and then tried 0 and it still used 5 seconds. I then set it to 1 second and it still used 5 seconds. There may be a gnome default of 5 seconds. I just don&#039;t know. I use KDE with PCLinusOS but the more I use Gnome the more I like it.</div>

The kids are going to be using the internet for home work assignments. So much of the content on the internet requires flash. I haven&#039;t had much success solving this problem.

It is rather involved from what I read. It&nbsp; has the advantage of taking the load off the server but increasing network traffic.&nbsp; Here is a link to a PDF that explains it.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">An update!<br /><br />We finally got the network cable from the office to the classroom for internet access. And got the K12 LTSP server and Monowall firewall up and functioning. Also have 10 clients up with the ram needed thanks to Ed. We are only running 4 clients right now waiting on additional ram for the server that I have ordered and should have by this weekend. Then we will have all 10 clients up and working with network printer and useful educational software and internet access.<br /><br />This got to be a very time intensive project very quickly and I thank everyone that got involved and helped.<br />I know that Camp Fire USA will greatly appreciate it and I know the kids do.<br /><br />I believe that Ed will have a short presentation at the meeting about the whole process and what K12 LTSP has to offer.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey Ed,<br /><br />I think the solution to the &quot;no sound with flash&quot; problem may be found here:<br /><br />http://pulseaudio.revolutionlinux.com/PulseAudio<br /><br />Another possible source of a fix is here:<br /><br />http://marc.info/?l=ltsp-discuss&amp;m=117390580113614&amp;w=1<br /><br />Perhaps not a trivial thing to get done, but there&#039;s an RPM package on the first site I listed (made for Mandriva, but might work OK with Fedora/LTSP) which would be easy to install and test.&nbsp; If it doesn&#039;t work, just uninstall the RPM and try the (harder) approaches.<br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br />Dan<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am happy to report I have sound with flashplayer in firefox on the clients working at least on my test server at home. I tried to install the Mandriva rpm but it failed because of dependencies so I went in to try to add the missing lib. When I went into add or remove software I decided to just search for PulseAudio first and it was in the fedora repo so I installed it and support for flash plugin and it worked. PulseAudio is what I had installed that killed all the sound but it was not from fedora. Who would have guessed it would have been right in front of me and so easy to fix. Thanks again Dan for the links. Now on to the client shutdown script.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Dynamic, although they should be in a specific range.<br /><br />In my opinion, I think an easier solution is for the Camp Fire staff just to power off the client machines when they leave for the day.&nbsp; On the server, perhaps a nightly cron could run that kills all client processes.&nbsp; Even easier, the server could just be scheduled to automatically reboot every night.&nbsp; Just my 2 cents worth.<br /><br /></div>
