					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">OK.&nbsp; I feel a need to communicate with some other Linuxians ... but don&#039;t know that a can contribute all that much in the short run.&nbsp; I have forgotten more CS than I know.&nbsp; Been in the industry off and on for al long time, but for the last 10 years of my working life I was a QA Analyst for McKession Information Systems ... so I haven&#039;t written a line of code in a very long time.&nbsp; Commands in UNIX have held me up for some time ... and MAN this and MAN that is not a very efficient way of learning.<br /><br />Current status:&nbsp; I am writing from Ubuntu 9.10.&nbsp; Started in 9.04 and upgraded.&nbsp; My niece&#039;s husband originally sent me Ubuntu after I expressed my curiosity about Linux.&nbsp; I hate Microsoft and, although I have an iPhone, Apple.&nbsp; I love the concept of Open Source and Linux. I have only the desktop version (on 2 laptops, dual boot), but I want to learn all I can.&nbsp; I have downloaded the latest Debian release, but loading it scares the hell out of me.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know enough.<br /><br />I have some exposure to Fortran, Basic, Pascal and the mandatory Assembly Language ... but none of it is in DRAM (interpret as frontal lobe, if you have a Psych background).<br /><br />I want to ask for info about editing the GRUB and basic (useful) commands for the Terminal.<br /><br />By the bye, aylacakes was my dog in Massachusetts, so anyone can call me Jim ... you don&#039;t want to use my 1st name, it is older than I am!!!<br /><br />I don&#039;t know anyone here using Linux, so ... here I am.<br /><br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Greetings, Jim, and welcome to Pensacola and the LUG.&nbsp; Glad to see new faces show up around here.<br /><br />Since you are new to Linux, I would recommend that you stick with Ubuntu, and not bother with trying to load Debian.&nbsp; It won&#039;t act any differently than Ubuntu, and is not nearly as user-friendly.&nbsp; Once you get a little more experienced you could certainly try that, or some other Linux distribution, but for now Ubuntu will do anything that you want to do.<br /><br />Using Linux does not require *ANY* programming/coding ability.&nbsp; It is not needed at all.&nbsp; Using commands (and man pages) is not the same thing as coding.&nbsp; I recently gave a presentation to the LUG regarding (basic) use of the command line, and you can download your own copy of it (it&#039;s a slideshow in OpenOffice format) here:&nbsp; http://members.cox.net/danc3/docs/cli_basic2.odp (http://members.cox.net/danc3/docs/cli_basic2.odp)&nbsp; &nbsp;That should get you some ideas and a start into using commands in a terminal.<br /><br />As for GRUB...&nbsp; the most recent version of Ubuntu is using a new version of GRUB, which is quite different than the &quot;original&quot; GRUB that many of us learned.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t real difficult to configure/edit, and here is a link to get you started on that:&nbsp; https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Grub2 (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Grub2)<br /><br />Feel free to ask any further questions that you may have, and think about attending our next scheduled LUG meeting, which should be either 4/15 or 4/17 (more news on that to follow here on the forums sometime soon).<br /><br />Again, welcome and enjoy!<br /><br />Dan<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome to Pensacola and the LUG Jim!<br /><br />Danc&#039;s overview of the command line is a great place to start. &nbsp;The terminal commands are by far the most important thing you need to learn when coming to linux, as once you get more advanced, you&#039;ll be doing a lot with bash.<br /><br />Since you&#039;re new to Ubuntu, I&#039;d recommend the Linux Starter Pack, which features a lot of overviews of common open source applications.<br />Link: &nbsp; http://www.tuxradar.com/linuxstarterpack<br /><br /><br />Another great resource is the Ubuntu Pocket Guide, though it may be out of date on some things (like GRUB).<br />Link: &nbsp; http://www.ubuntupocketguide.com<br /><br /><br /><br />If you need any assistance feel free to post your questions or join us in our IRC channel:<br /><br />Server: &nbsp; &nbsp; zelazny.freenode.net<br />Channel: &nbsp;#pensacola_linux<br /><br />Or, use the webIRC client here: &nbsp;http://pcolalug.org/irc/irc.cgi<br /><br /><br /></div>
