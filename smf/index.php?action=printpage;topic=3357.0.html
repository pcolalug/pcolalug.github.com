					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have to admit, Vista is actually a pretty good operating system.&nbsp; For everyday users it&#039;s absolutely fine.<br /><br />However, everyone is freaking out because of its less-than-phenomenal sales numbers partnered with the slanders being shoved down people&#039;s throats by Apple&#039;s propaganda.<br /><br />Vista was destined to be what I call a &quot;minor release&quot; from the beginnin.&nbsp; Take a look at past Windows versions:<br /><br /><br />Windows 98 - dot com boom taking place, the majority of people&#039;s computers (that I know at least) had 98<br /><br />Windows ME/2000 -&nbsp; People still using Windows 98, no need for the upgrade.<br /><br />Windows XP -&nbsp; Hardware by now (~5 years) getting old, replacement of 56K dial-up with cable modems require new hardware, so, they might as well upgrade.&nbsp; Plus, complete overhaul of UI<br /><br />Windows Vista -&nbsp; only minor UI changes, XP&#039;s fine, it still works, no need to upgrade.<br /><br />Windows 7 -&nbsp; XP machines aging, coupled with a possible increase in interest in PC gaming and more video applications, more power required so it will sell.&nbsp; Rumours of major changes in UI as well.<br /><br />Windows 8 -&nbsp; Won&#039;t sell because people still using Windows 7<br /><br />Windows 9 - Will sell.<br /><br />etc....<br /><br /><br />Also, Ballmer was egged in Hungary.&nbsp; That was hilarious.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Wow. This is the first I have heard of anyone posting anything positive about Vista. Personally, I wish I had not plopped $200 on Vista. The only reason I keep it is that it runs much faster on my MacBook than it does on my brand new PC. So, Fedora goes on the PC and Vista is dual-booted on the MacBook.</div>
