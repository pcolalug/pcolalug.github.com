					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The November meeting is scheduled a week from today.&nbsp; I was hoping that perhaps someone could do a presentation.&nbsp; Wardriving would be a preferred topic, followed by a discussion of the possibility of a contest.<br /><br />Of course, the door remains open to anyone willing to do another presentation on absolutely anything really.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am planning to do a presentation on VPN using Hamachi. I would also like to talk about VNC through Hamachi. I have not gotten the VNC working the way I want. I will bang on it more this week, but if anyone wants to lend a hand with some ideas, you are welcome to step up.<br /><br />I also would like to give a few minutes for anyone who has found a neat piece of software and wants to share it with the group to do so.<br /><br />Look forward to seeing everyone Thursday Nov. 20.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">We had 6 people for the meeting tonight. We talked a bit about the new OpenOffice.org version. And the presentation was on Hamachi. The network did not link up correctly, but I think everyone got the idea of how easy it is to set up and some of the ideas of what can be done with a VPN.<br /><br />It was decided that the December meeting would take place on its normal night, December 18. We are also talking about a legacy gift exchange. This can be discussed in the December 2008 meeting thread (http://www.pcolalug.org/smf/index.php?topic=3428.0).<br /><br />For future meetings, we talked about giving people a time to share about any new software, or features you have been playing with. This would not have to be a full presentation, but just a short description of what the software does. A great way to learn about new products, or old ones with a new polish. Come to future meetings prepared to share. You won&#039;t need to let us know before hand, just be ready and we will give you time to talk if you have something for us.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Dang it, I totally forgot about last night&#039;s meeting. I forgot to put it in my phone calendar and completely forgot. Oh well, I went ahead and stuck December&#039;s meeting in my calendar, so hopefully, I won&#039;t forget that one.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Excellent idea WoodyHarold! Anything that you have seen from the past that we may have forgotten, mention them. Sometimes good ideas get forgotten or were never known to the current generation. (Though I have no excuse for forgetting this one.)</div>
