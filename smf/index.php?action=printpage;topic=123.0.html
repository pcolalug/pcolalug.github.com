Granted, you can use it as a server but it is very gui oriented. So, if your using RH as a server and happy with it, I'd say stick with it. If you'd like to try out a Desktop OS then try Mandrake. It's very easy to setup and usually work right the first time. Mandrake is also very big on including cutting edge software in their distro. That's why they release a new version every 6 months.<br /><br />Remember, you won't read much about the succesful installs in a forum so don't use them to guage how good a Distro is. I go by the rule of thumb that if I want to see the good points about a product I'll look for reviews. If I want to see what kind of problems people have with it, I go to the forums.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I agree with Steve, if RH is working for you then stick with it. I would hate the thought of you having to go through all the configuration of your server just to try Mandrake. But, as a desktop Mandrake is great.<br /><br />If you have a computer that you can load it and play with as a desktop I think you will like it. I am currently running (http://www.dpeach.com) mail, dhcp, router, firewall, and web server all on a Mandrake 8.1 machine. As a server it has worked well for me. But all the time I have invested in getting it tweaked the way I want, there is no amount of talking would get me to change to RH, or any other distro. If your server is working as a RH box, I would not tell you to switch. <br /><br />For my server, I have too many config files that I would have to figure out again if I switched distros. I don't do this everyday, so each thing I learn usually is unlearned by the time I need to do something with it again. I guess that is why you should document your work. Maybe one of these days I will learn.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">What a lot of people forget, or don't realize, is, it doesn't matter which distro you're running. The difference between RH, SuSE, Mandrake, Slackware, etc. is what programs they package with Linux and the user interface for managing the system. <br /><br />Linux IS the kernel and it's pretty much the same in all the distros. There may be some minor differences but nothing that the user really needs to worry about.<br /><br />So, if I'm running Mandrake from the console with my apache web server running and sendmail/qmail/whatever and dhcpd and squid, and snort, etc. It isn't any different than running RH with the same stuff. <br /><br />IMHO when it comes to servers, the difference of a good distro vs a not so good distro is how fast they release security updates for the packages. <br /><br />But Apache is still Apache whether it is running on RH or Mandrake.<br /><br />Think of it like a book. If I write a book and it's published by doubleday it may have one cover but if it's published by O'reilly it may have another cover. The book is still the same, it's just the cover/wrapping that has changed.<br /><br />However, when it comes to desktop distros, you need to look at who has the easiest interface to work with. Again all the software is pretty much the same but the interface and management tools will be different. Then it comes down to which gui management tools and interface you like better.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I agree that they are all the same at the core. So Linux is Linux. But when you are configuring your servers, there are differences in directory structures. So I can't just pull one configuration file from one server and expect it to work on another distro.<br /><br />That is where I have the biggest beef with all the different distros. I cannot learn everyone's own directory structure. I know there are some efforts to change this in the future. I am just afraid that the things I currently know will be changed.<br /><br />The better you know your own distro, the easier it is to work.<br /><br />I do agree that the software that is running is the same. But configuring it would be different for different distros.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Actually, the config file *should* work unaltered or with minor modifications, assuming you are using the same version of foo. &nbsp;It is a major PITA tracking down just *where* your distro puts things (I use SuSE, I know whereof I speak &nbsp;:?) but the usual suspects (/usr/local/, /usr/local/etc/, /etc/, /opt/ ...) are generally where you'll find what you need. And hey, there's always your friendly &quot;find / | grep foo | less&quot; ;)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for all the info on Mandrake. &nbsp;I am currently just about finished with a new server for where I work using RH 7.2 with a 2.4.18 kernel. &nbsp;As far as the server I admin, I will most likley stick with RH, but at home I might give Mandrake a try for a desktop os.<br />./Michael</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You also might consider Lycoris (http://www.lycoris.com) for the desktop. &nbsp;I played with the Amythist release quite a bit back in the day, and I have to say that the install is even easier than Mandrake. &nbsp;It looks nice and has some great management apps. &nbsp;Fair warning, though: this is not a developer distro out of the box. &nbsp;You can download a separate iso that has most of the common dev libs and such if you need that sort of thing (and who doesn't). &nbsp;I usually recommend it over Mandrake to folks just starting out, though that may change once I get around to finishing my eval of OEOne (http://www.oeone.com), which is, somewhat ironically, a RedHat-only kind of desktop.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've run every distro I could get my hands on. In fact, I'm known for formatting my computer several times a week &nbsp;;)<br /><br />Right now I'm testing out SuSE 8.0 and I really like it. But generally Mandrake (at least up to 8.2) was my distro of choice. <br /><br />The problems I've had with my latest computer though have given me reason to stop using Mandrake (and RedHat). First thing is the kernel they include gives me major problems with my sound card. I can compile a custom kernel to fix that, but also the compiler that comes with recent versions of RH and MDK give me problems. (XMMS, mplayer are almost unusable for me). <br /><br />I've tried Slackware, it's okay. I've run ever version of RH since 5, and I like it. Mandrake just has the nicest installer (and most robust set of desktop apps IMHO). I must say though, I made the trip into FreeBSD territory recently. I downloaded and installed FBSD 4.6.2 and it is very nice. It uses a lot less resources than recent versions of linux, and seems to support my hardware better out of the box.. But it has it's problems too, mainly VMWare and Kylix don't run on it (two programs I like to play around with). If not for that, I would still be running it. <br /><br />SuSE seems nice, but it's a pain to install. I couldn't find any iso images to download so I had to do a (2.6GB) install via FTP. Not too terrible over DSL, but it still took a few hours. SuSE seems to support my hardware perfectly, but I ran into a problem with it too. The custom kernel they use (it includes memory patches from the 2.5 series) causes VMWare not to work. So I had to compile a custom kernel and disable >4gb memory support. It actually took me about 4 tries to get the kernel compiled and still have all my hardware work, but it's up and running fine now. <br /><br />Back on MDK though, I had some stability problems with KDE3 (especially Konqueror) that I'm not seeing in SuSE. I'm gonna take a guess and say it's the compiler that comes with MDK. Anyone else have problems with konqueror crashing frequently? <br /><br />-- Nick</div>
