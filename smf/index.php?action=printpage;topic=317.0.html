					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello all,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Found this user group and thought I'd try to join in. &nbsp;I am a newbie with Linux, although I do have a working machine set up (Redhat 8.0). &nbsp;I played with Slackware several years ago and got tired of the effort required to do anything, but am now wanting to try things again. &nbsp;I must say that they have improved the user interface an amazing amount.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway, my immediate goals with Linux are to get functionally literate with it, and make it work with my current Windows home network. &nbsp;I'd also like to get a game server (RTCW) running on it. &nbsp;I plan to try to attend the meeting in a couple of days (still at the Books-a-Million?), and look forward to meeting some of you. &nbsp;I will bring a few questions with me if you can help (first one will be about networking w/ WinXP - Samba?)...<br />Regards,<br />Dan Clough</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for joining us.<br /><br />I regret to inform you that there will not be a meeting this weekend. We are working on getting the site updated to reflect the change. We had a big holiday bash at one of the member's homes this last week in place of our normal meeting.<br /><br />Since we won't have a meeting for another month, go ahead and fire off your questions in the appropriate forum category. We have people qualified to help in just about every area.<br /><br />We did have a RTCW server running this weekend at our meeting this last week. So someone knows how to answer any of those questions.<br /><br />I have gotten Linux to play well with Windows in my network. This is assuming that I am trying to access my Windows machines from Linux. I have yet to be able to go the other direction. But it is not a priority with me at the moment, so I have canned the project. Going from Linux to Windows though has been the answer to my needs.<br /><br />Again, welcome.<br /><br />David <br />VP, Pcola LUG</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">High and welcome! I ran the RtCW server at the Christmas party, so I'd be glad to give you a hand if you need it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for the welcomes, and will hope to make the January meeting... &nbsp;As for the RTCW server, I've got the game installed, am now struggling with how the various config files get done in the Linux version. &nbsp;Some insight on that would be great. &nbsp;Thanks.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Nothing too tricky, as I recall. I started the app in GUI mode most of the time and will go back later over the config files and let you know if there are any sticky issues. Is there a particular problem you are having? If you want to discuss in person, a few of us are meeting for lunch today at 11:30 at the Pizza Hut on Mobile Hwy. Gluttony and the geeks, as I like to call it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Are you running a firewall locally on the server or client machine? This has been a problem for both dpeach and I in the past. There are some ports you have to pass through any filters in order to see and talk to the server. The exact one's, of coarse, escape me at the moment, but a look through /var/log/messages and the wolf config files and logs might give them up.<br /><br />EDIT: oops, I meant server or client machine. (...locally on the server or client machine?)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Pretty much what rburt3 said.. A local firewall on your machine will get in the way of running any service that's not explicitly allowed, and that sounds like what you've got going on.<br /><br />AFAIK, RtCW's server listens on port 27970 (someone correct me if I'm wrong), and you'll have configure the local firewall to allow it access to that port.. &nbsp;I'm not sure how you'd do that with Redhat though, so sorry if these directions sound rather vague &nbsp;:?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">In Red Hat, its under server settings -&gt; security level or some such. The problem is that I am unsure if you can explicitly name ports or not. I'll check when I get back to my house later tonight.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you want to be sure if it is your firewall settings, you can probably just run this to flush all your iptables rule:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"># iptables -F</div><br />Run that as root on the server, then try connecting to your RtCW server from another system on your internal network. You might want to take down your Internet connection because your box will be completely open to the world. If that works, I'm sure we can help you with adding a rule to open up those ports. I'm sure someone runs RH8.0 and can find the file that holds the configs. <br /><br />I guess I should write an article on setting up a firewall script so people don't have to depend on those piece of crap scripts that the distros made up. I think we should all know how to make up our own firewall script. The only problem is I have too much I want to work on as it is.<br /><br />Oh, welcome to the group! I hope to meet you when I come back to town for a visit. Also, thanks for getting me out of FNG status. I was getting tired of seeing my name at the bottom as last person to register. I hope to see plenty of posts from you!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">All,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks for the welcomes, and the various tips on my RTCW server problems. &nbsp;I've tried those things, with no success (sort of). &nbsp;Maybe I'll move this thread to the &quot;Games&quot; forum, and post some more detailed symptoms/questions. &nbsp;Appreciate the responses, and please check the other forum to see if you can help me resolve this. &nbsp;Thanks again.</div>
