					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">While out for a walk in my backyard on Tuesday I came across this pyramid, that through my studies, I have discovered the Mayans called Uxmal (oosh-mal).<br /><br />(http://dpeach.com/pics/uxmalsm.jpg) (http://dpeach.com/pics/uxmal.jpg)<br /><br />While digging around here, my wife and I were surprised to learn that console gaming has been around for quite some time. It seems the Mayans were, once again, ahead of their time. And, that, once again, Microsoft has stolen an idea and marketed it as their own.<br /><br />Doing some investigating, there is a carving on the back (sorry the wording was unreadable in the photo that I took) that contains a bit of information. It was manufactured in 982 A. D. in another Mayan city named Dzibilchaltun (zee-beel-chawl-toon). Serial number was 13.<br /><br />Get this...the name of it was <b><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.3em;">X Rox</span></b>! Microsoft was not even that original in their name.<br /><br />(http://dpeach.com/pics/xrox.jpg) (http://dpeach.com/pics/xroxsm.jpg)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That's hilarious! &nbsp;Awesome, but hilarious. &nbsp;I wonder what the Microsoft reps would say to something like that showing up on their desks.<br /><br />On the positive side, at least my XBox can run Linux if I have a need for it. &nbsp;:twisted: However, I think I'd have an easier time getting that one working. :lol:</div>

Especially as I am a guest in their country (currently going through some visa problems and am affectionately known as a &quot;wet back&quot; here), I did not take the risk.<br /><br />But, if someone wanted to send it to them, I could give you directions as to where to find it.</div>
