					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey, I was bored New Years Day and I decided to look for a local lug. I guess I found it.<br /><br />I live on Pensacola Beach, and I've been interested in linux since I was about 9 years old (well, I'm only 15 now). I'm not your average 15 year old though. For instance, I built a SuSE machine from scrap parts I found around my friends and my own house (its aptly named 'Frankenstein) and didn't pay $0.01 for it. I hope all my linux endeavors will be as enjoyable. I also run a website (http://www.martext.com/). (I'm sorry if this comes off as bragging, I don't mean it to, I'm just rather proud of myself :)). I must confess, however, that I'm still somewhat of a newbie to linux, as I didn't get much use out of my 120mhz pentium 1 with ~74mb of RAM. I'm hoping to learn more soon though, as I'm planning on dual booting Gentoo and WinXP.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to being a part of the group and I'm going to see if I can make it to the next meeting!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome to the group. &nbsp;Your habit will get worse with age. &nbsp;I started with computers programming a COCO3 when I was in elementary school, moved on to Apple //, and other proprietary systems. &nbsp;Built an IBM XT out of donated parts when I was probably 13 and haven't looked back. &nbsp;Now I have no less than 8 working computers at home, most of them running Linux and FreeBSD. &nbsp;And a few websites, lots of tech books. &nbsp;It's kinda sad huh &nbsp;:oops: <br /><br />Look forward to seeing everyone at the next meeting.<br /><br />Nick</div>

My first linux box was a 486DX4/100 with 32 MB RAM. That thing was a great Slackware box with Apache and WU-FTPD. I also ended up setting it up as an IPFWADM and IPMASQ firewall/connection sharing box (dialed to the ISP for me). Then it became an IPCHAINS system and was then upgraded to a K6-266 box with 96 MB of memory. I threw in a trident video card(w00t) and was able to run X finally. I ended up using WindowMaker and pretty much used X to have a bunch of terms going on multiple desktops. I ran that box was used as my proftpd server and iptables firewall until just recently when I aquired a K6-2/500. When I get back from the desert (see my introduction (http://www.pcolalug.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=295)), I plan on building the old K6 up again for the firewall agian and then using the k6-2 as a second desktop box...maybe even experiment with making a small 3 box beowulf cluster...haven't decided yet. Anyway, the point is, anything above a 386 is great for linux. It may not be blazing fast, but it will do the job. The power of Linux (or any Un*x) is in the command line.<br /><br />(rant over)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: martext</div><div class="quote">I'm hoping to learn more soon though, as I'm planning on dual booting Gentoo and WinXP.</div><br /><br />Have you run Debian before or another of the more command-line-centric distros before. Oh yeah, you ran SuSE. All I'm saying is, the install is one of the tougher ones out there and is not geared towards newbies at all (ex. you have to name all of the optimization flags for gcc and the docs weren't that good the last time I looked). Also, the installation doesn't always go quite as planned as it messes up since you are compiling everything from source and the scripts are fool proof. I'm not saying to forget about it and choose something else, it is just that it is sometimes more work than what it is worth, but then that is what seperates the geeks from the rest of the world. <br /><br />For a learning experience, though, run through a linux from scratch install. http://www.linuxfromscratch.org. I am going through my second one right now and I forgot how much fun it is. You really learn a lot more from that than installing any distro because you can examine and optimize everything exactly the way you want it. You could probably even integrate Portage into it if you were slick. I have seen instructions on how to integrate Debian's apt...<br /><br />Anyway, enough of my long winded post. Welcome and I look forward to hearing more from you in the future.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I guess I should take a hint and leave the long winded rants out of the introductions section. Here is my first attempt at a short message.<br /><br />Welcome to the group and I look forward to seeing your future posts!<br /><br />Short, sweet and to the point. I do have it in me.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey I am the master of working with nothing...he he ha ha<br />Linux is great in the fact that it is actually built to run on the slower machines. Take freeBSD for instance I had it running on a 15mhz/386 with 4 megs of ram and 160meg hard drive and from command line did everything I wanted.<br />The point is we all have a little something to bring to the table and I hope to see some input or questions coming from you Sir!<br />It's all in the learning.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks, all of you. I ended up just wiping my main harddrive and installing gentoo, sortof a head-first, forced-type learning experience :). Its been fun though. I (obviously) have it running, as I'm posting this from Mozilla, and am working on getting my audigy working. I'm glad I found a group of geeks (and I mean that in a good way) that I can look up to. Looking forward to being a member!<br /><br />Martext</div>
