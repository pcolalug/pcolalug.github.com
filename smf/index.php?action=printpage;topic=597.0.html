					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This sounded like a good question to go here.<br /><br />I need to know how to start a daemon (httpd) on startup. I have been looking on the web and have found that there are apparently several ways to do this, depending on which distro you have. I am sure there is some standard way that would work in any distro though. I am trying to do this on my Zaurus running kernel 2.4.6.<br /><br />In Mandrake I can set some check boxes that will start items at startup. <br /><br />I already have /home/www/bin in my path, so I just need to add the command &quot;httpd&quot; somewhere to make it start when I reboot.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hmmmm..... &nbsp;You do have to be ROOT to run the chkconfig command. &nbsp;Not too familiar with the Zaurus... &nbsp;do you log into it? &nbsp;If so, try it as root (or use &quot;su -&quot; first). &nbsp;Hope it helps.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I really don't think there's a 'standard' way to do this. &nbsp;I think the chkconfig scripts are from RedHat (I don't have it on my Slackware router for example). &nbsp;The most common way I can tell you is to edit /etc/rc.d/rc.local and add the commands / scripts you want to the end of that. &nbsp;rc.local is the last script to get run at bootup. &nbsp; <br /><br />In fact that's what I did on my router, here's my rc.local file<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"><br />#!/bin/sh<br />#<br /># /etc/rc.d/rc.local&#58; &nbsp;Local system initialization script.<br />#<br /># Put any local setup commands in here&#58;<br /><br /># Call the Internet<br />pppd call adsl<br /><br /># Start DHCPD server<br />/usr/sbin/dhcpd<br /><br /># Launch the Firewall script<br />/etc/rc.d/rc.firewall<br /><br /># Update ZoneEdit IP<br />/etc/rc.d/rc.homeweb.org &<br /><br /># Starting MySQL Server<br />/usr/bin/safe_mysqld &<br /></div><br /><br /><br />Good luck,<br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: danc</div><div class="quote">do you log into it?</div><br />Nope, always run as root.<br /><br />Imnes, I have tried adding just &quot;httpd&quot; to the end of the /etc/rc.d/rc.local file. That did not work, so I tried adding the hard path to the file (/home/www/bin/httpd), that did not work either.<br /><br />Because the /etc/rc.d/rc.local file exists, I expected that this approach would work. But alas, no worky.<br /><br />Back to the google (http://www.google.com).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Did you check your /var/log/syslog or /var/log/messages? Any kind of errors? You might want to check the main initialization script and make sure rc.local is included in the execution list. Also, make sure rc.local is executable.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: dpeach</div><div class="quote">How do I find out whether something is in the execution list?</div><br /><br />You have &quot;runlevels&quot; in unix-like systems. Runlevels are for each stage of bootup or shutdown of your system. These runlevels are all dependent on your system and distribution as they are not set in stone. Anyway, different things are either initialized or disabled depending on the change of runlevel. The scripts that make these changes are the initialization scripts.<br /><br />The initialization scripts, or init scripts, are setup in one of two fashions: BSD or System V. In most modern linux distributions, the SysV style is used. This is where you have scripts for each daemon in /etc/init.d and then you /etc/rcX.d for each runlevel. The scripts in /etc/init.d are symbolically linked to the /etc/rcX.d directory that it needs to be executed on; X being the particular runlevel.<br /><br />BSD style init scripts work a little differently, however. Slackware and its derivates are the only major linux distributions that I know of that still use BSD style init scripts, but they are still worth mentioning. In BSD style, you have /etc/rc.d. In this directory, you have rc.X which is for the appropriate runlevel and then those scripts call up the various rc.[insert name]. <br /><br />Now, with that established, you want to make sure rc.local is executable like imnes said. Once that is determined, you need to make sure rc.local is going to be executed on system startup. On a BSD style system, you can look in (typically) /etc/rc.d/rc.M. This is the file that initializes your multiuser mode. On a SysV style system, check /etc/rc[2345].d for a symbolic link to /etc/init.d/rc.local. It will probably look like /etc/rc2.d/S99rc.local and be pointed to /etc/init.d/rc.local. To find symbolic links, you use ls -l and it will show you where the link is pointing to. <br /><br />Let me know what you find after this and we can go from there. I hate to go through the explanation for both styles of init scripts on how to add a new init script if it is unnecessary. The biggest help would be knowing how the init scripts are setup.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I bet you could add a line to the end of the inet file to start your daemon. If it is broken up into start|stop|restart, then add that line to the end of the start section of that script.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Steve thanks for the suggestion. How easy is that to install on the Zaurus? From what I understand, I need Perl to install Webmin. That is yet another package to download and install. Though it is only 1 Mb and Webmin (tarred) is only 6.1 MB, I did not want to have to add all the bloat if one line in a config file can be added.<br /><br />Perl is useful outside of this project, but I will probably dump Webmin after this use.<br /><br />At the moment I need to put off the project for the day. I will get back to it in the morning, after I wake up from the Indianapolis to Pensacola drive today.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

I forgot this was about the Zaurus. Webmin would be used on a dekstop. Unfortunately, on the Zaurus, you will have to go into a shell to do it. I'm not sure about how to exactly set it up on the Zaurus as I don't have a PHD yet in programming and Linux. &nbsp;:D <br /><br />You might head over to the Zaurus Zone and post the question there.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">What if you just add the line <br /><br />httpd<br /><br />or maybe just<br /><br />http<br /><br />to your /etc/rc.d/init.d file? &nbsp;Otherwise open up /etc/inittab and look for the line<br /><br />id:4:initdefault <br /><br />(or something like that). That tells you what runlevel your system starts in. Mine starts in 4 (I think the zaurus is the same, or it might use 3?) &nbsp;But then open up /etc/rc.d/rc.4 (or rc.3) and ad the line to start your httpd server.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">OK, let me try and catch up.<br /><br />Steve, Yes, I have been to prometheanheat.com. That is where I got the apachectl and actlsetup. Though Apache was working fine before, I did install apachectl and it still works fine. Zauruszone did not have my answer and www.zaurus.com/dev/board has been off and on all weekend. I was able to post my question when it was up once and I have gotten an answer that I will try and let you know the results.<br /><br />Imnes, rc.5 is what the Z runs at. Already tried that.<br /><br />Altomo, forgive me for not completely understanding all of that. But I think you are showing me how to check and make sure Apache will start. Apache works great, I am just trying to figure out how to get it to start at bootup.<br /><br />I did not mean for this to be so difficult. I thought this would be a good discussion to go into here because it would be a simple answer for newbies to know how to accomplish this. I have a lead from the Zaurus forum that I will try and let you know how it goes.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">After working with David on this one night, I wonder if the Zaurus doesn't do something funky during startup. We put the apachectl start as last line of the inet script in the start section and it still didn't start up. Has anyone thought to look in the /var/logs? Wouldn't any errors be recorded in /var/log/messages? I know those init scripts are supposed to be run as root, but what if it isn't on the Zaurus or it is something weird like that? I don't think this is the methods we have tried to get this thing to startup. I think this is a funkiness of the Zaurus.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Success!<br /><br />After asking on the www.zaurus.com/dev/board my question, I have come up with the following answer.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: My new best friend, hausman</div><div class="quote">Create a text file called S49local in /etc/rc.d/rc5.d<br /><br />inside it, put<br /><br />/home/www/bin/httpd start<br /><br />make S49local executable, and restart.</div><br />I have no idea what is special about the S49local name, but it did the trick.<br /><br />Rugmonster, I only have two logs in /var/log directory: dmesg, wtemp. dmesg does not have anything that looks like what I am going after and wtmp is empty.<br /><br />Here is the thread (http://www.zaurus.com/dev/board/index.php?s=212843285c1fb2c609b3df3e22f0ebfd&act=ST&f=3&t=2197&st=0&#entry12685) at the other board.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">S means start<br /><br />49 this is the number in which this process will start. ie. will start before any higher numbers and after any lower numbers.<br /><br />local means nothing really<br /><br />I would suggest reading about startup and shutdown scripts. &nbsp;This is what I was getting to in my early posts, but I guess I wasnt clear or assumed to much.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, that approach isn't exactly proper because the right way to do it is to make your httpd initialization script in /etc/rc.d/init.d and then make a symbolic link to the rcX.d as SXXhttpd. The X in rcX.d being the corresponding runlevel and X in SXXhttpd being the order number of which you want it to start. Anywho, glad you got it working. I was trying to avoid that by having you put it in another script, but whatever &nbsp;:wink:</div>
