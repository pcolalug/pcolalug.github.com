					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">For those of you (alot of you) who weren't part of tonight's <br /><br /><b>Thursday Night Maaaaaddddnneessssssss</b><br /><br />I'll introduce myself. I'm not sure exactly what belongs here so if you want to know something..just ask.<br /><br />I'm an avid Linux user (duh!) and have been for the past 8 years. I started with an early version of Slackware which I pretty much just mudded with after I got PPP working. After on and off linux tinkering, Mobius and myself (Mobius being the key player) started the ISP where Rugmonster and I worked together at. (We also went to high school together) &nbsp;Since my time in Milton, I've moved to Boston, completed my Bachelor's degree and am now looking forward to potentially moving again. &nbsp;Throughout college I worked as a linux/unix sys admin at Boston University and Quoin Inc primarily running BU Linux and Debian respectively. At home, I'm a Debian user. &nbsp;I've used quite a few distributions, but Debian has stayed at the top of my list consistently. My main system is a Debian/unstable machine, and my HostAP (closet) box is a Debian/woody machine. &nbsp;Aside from managing linux systems, I like to program. My langauge of choice is C, but I'll use pretty much anything (SML anyone?). I'm currently learning Java for work.<br /><br />I'm not sure what else there is to say. My windowmanager of choice is ctwm, and I look forward to fragging and getting fragged by some fellow Linux users from Pensacola. &nbsp;I'll try to make a meeting when I'm down that way next!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for joining us. <br /><br />I guess we have to remove all the &quot;Debian bashing&quot; threads in the forum now that we have someone who would actually support it in our group. willi already beat me up on the battlefield last night. My Debian posts will give him more fodder for tenacious fighting. :lol: <br /><br />Welcome.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome! Sorry I missed the frag fest. And don't listen to dpeach re Debian, if he can't click it, he's lost... ;)<br /><br />Really good to hear there are still some folks out there who like C! I use Java(TM) at work too, and, of the OO languages, its prolly the most &quot;comfy&quot; to program in so far (still need to give SmallTalk and Ada a better try...).<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: 1.3em;">Java(TM) is a trademark of Sun Microsystems. Used without permission.</span></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">No worries about the Debian bashing - It's not my loss. ;-)<br /><br />As for C, I would love to have certain OO features in C (just to clean up<br />the namespaces), but moving up to C++ has never been worth it to me. &nbsp;<br />Java has been surprisingly straightforward to pick up, though. With a JDK and Google,<br />it takes no time at all to get going. &quot;Comfy&quot; is the right word for it. &nbsp;I haven't used either <br />smalltalk or ada so I can't throw in anything there. &nbsp;I do like standard ML's OO implementation<br />(modules), if you don't mind a functional programming language.<br /><br />Hopefully more people will make the next fragfest - I know I'm planning on being there!<br /><br />Thanks for all the intro responses! It seems like people actually use this board...</div>

I've had my requisite attempts at grokking Scheme via the Wizard Book &amp; MIT's interpreter, but haven't spent enough time with it to have my &quot;aha!&quot; moment yet.

It definitely made it easier to get to <br />the &quot;Aha!&quot; point for me. (I learned scheme via a class so I got forced into it with given assignments.)<br />It can also be compiled down to C and then to platform binaries for fast execution! [I think]<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: rburt3</div><div class="quote"> What sorts of things have you built with ML?</div><br />Mostly just academic stuff. &nbsp;The largest project I've done with it was implement a <br />parser, type-checker, type-inferer, and evaluator for a typed function laguange that <br />supported Let-polymorphism on both variables and types (similar to ML's). &nbsp;I really enjoyed <br />using the language, but I haven't yet found a good excuse to use it more in my spare time.<br />If you know of anything cool, I'd love to hear about it!</div>

Until recently, I ran a debian box at home and I still support it with folks in #linux on EFNet. I just haven't pushed it on you guys because you all seem to happy with the fluffy distros.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Actually, as much as I talk, some of my favorite distros from the past as well as a couple that I am currently interested in, are Debian based.</div>
