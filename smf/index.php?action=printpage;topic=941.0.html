					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Greetings all,<br /><br />I was just curious, I didn't notice the announcement about tonight's meeting being cancelled and I went anyway, now I see that it was in fact cancelled. :) Silly me.<br /><br />Anyway, there is a LAN party and corresponding thread referenced, is that the LAN party thread here?:<br /><br />http://www.pcolalug.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=639<br /><br />Because that thread just seems to be a bit old. Anyway, any details anyone could provide would be great. I'd love to try and make a LAN party.<br /><br /><br />cheers,<br /><br /><br /><br />Tim</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Although we did call of this months meeting I did go down to oscar's and eat dinner and wait for anybody that missed the notice.<br />Scarecrow showed up and we had some really good conversation about Computers and the world in general.<br />As for the LAN party it is suppose to be this coming saturday.<br />You provide your own machine patch cord. Jesse will provide the server for us and the hub's.<br />THe above mentioned link above is the lan party link and the directions to Jesse's house should be in there. If any thing has changed hopefully they will post it here.<br />P.S it is a BYOB event. and we usaully all pitch in a couple of dollars and buy pizza. The event usaully starts about 3:00pm</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Lan party is still on, but everyone will have to excuse the current &quot;construction&quot; debris. I'm in the process of remodeling the office and the official &quot;server room&quot; so all of the servers are now in the room where we normally play. If anybody knows or does good, cheap drywall work, point them my direction. I would appreciate an email to jjarrell@inoch.com so I can be prepared for space.<br /><br />Thanks![/url]</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Things have been weird as far as DNS goes. Some people can send to it, while others can't. I've cleaned up DNS for all of my domains, and hopefully as soon as the TTL expires, it'll work. In the meantime, try jjarrell@hitechwizard.net<br /><br />Thanks</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">3pm is a good time to start. That'll give us time to setup, and tweak systems as needed. Crowe is bringing his switch, so I think we'll be ok on the equipment end. Do bring at least a 6' network cable.<br /><br />Just so you don't have to go look for it, the address is:<br /><br />8221 Excelsior Dr.<br /><br />It's off Olive between 9th &amp; Davis. In case you get lost, the number here (Inoch, Inc.) &nbsp;is 476-5631<br /><br />See ya' this afternoon!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, you missed a good one. We had 6 local and 2 offsites running ET. <br />And BTW, Dan, you forgot your power strip. I'll set it out in case you come by to get it.<br /><br />Jesse</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The other thought on this is why would you want users in virtual domains ssh into the box? This would be a very BAD idea in a commercial environment as one domain could potentially take out other domains on the same box. The way we handle it here at Inoch is if they want that much acces, they can co-locate a server, and then do as they please with it. Otherwise, virtual servers/space for mail, web and ftp is all they get.</div>
