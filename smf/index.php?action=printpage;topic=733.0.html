					Post by: <b></b> on <b>May 30, 2003, 01:50:02 am</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey all, Been a while since I've made a post here... <br /><br />Long post ahead, so beware &nbsp;:? <br /><br />I need some advice and maybe some help to those who are able. I live over in Bellview... Outside of Pensacola... Anyways, In Jan 2002 I dropped out of high school... I did really bad in school and failed... and being the school system in Pensacola is aweful, really didn't help much. So I dropped out and waited until I was 18 to get my GED... I turned 18 in Oct 2002... My Mom was attending classes at PJC... so, I took some GED prep classes at PJC... in Dec, I took the GED test, in Jan of this year, I got the results, which I passed and now have my GED. <br /><br />Here it is, Almost June 2003... I never had my first job... and I've applied for a few... a few years ago, I applied for a job at Albertsons, No Go... Recently I've been applying again. There was a PC Support Tech job which was part time and only for 3 months at the Escambia County School District... Again, I didn't get that job. I then got realisitic and applied for a job over in Gulf Breeze at the wal-mart. They called me in for a interview, and it lasted around 2 or 3 hours... I thought FOR SURE i would have got that job, because the dept head person who was interviewing me, asked me to fill out alot of paperwork, and told me all about the company and stuff... Well, That was over a month ago... My mom dropped out of college, and now she just works at wal-mart... and my aunts roommate also got a job at wal-mart... I called wal-mart and asked them about it. They said they are in a hiring phase, but they have no openings in the area I appied for (Electrionics) So, meaning, I didn't get the job.<br /><br />See, I've got alot of problems right now. Me and my mom live with my grandparents, my mom hit rock bottom and couldn't live on her own. My mom currently has no health insurence and has two main health problems. She has lympho edema in her legs, and also has a disabled arm from when she was working at a factory in elision industroy park (spelling) She's tried to get on Medicaid, but she can't for several reasons, same with Disibity. She comes home from wal-mart every night in pain and limping because of her leg condition... In the month she has been working at wal-mart, she's already had two infections in her legs. She wants to keep the job however, because wal-mart provides health insurence, which she doesn't currently have. She's talked to a lawyer and she was informed she doesn't have any chance of getting medicaaid or disability.<br /><br />I too also have problems of my own. I've don't have health insurence as well, and, I've got a bad right knee. I am unable to run, or do anything that stresses my knee. What happend is, Since I was little, my knee cap would pop out of place, and just go back into place without a problem... I never knew it was my knee cap, till this past time. I was home building my new computer and was on the floor where my tower was, connecting the front LED's and power switch and stuff... anyways, when I went to get up, BOOM, It poped out of place. I moved my leg around like I always did, and it went back into place... I was just in extream pain. At this time we had heath insurence.. Went to the doctor... and he said come back in a week.. well, a few days later my mom was getting some medicine at the drug store... she found out the health insruence we've been using was termanted. See, Me and her was on my step dads health insruecne. But, they were seprated at the time... they were marrried like 2 years... married in 1999 and seprated in 2001. Anyways, He took me and my mom off his health insurence plan to &quot;save money&quot; for himself, even though he knows about my moms problems. A few days after this happend, My backup health insurence, Medicaid, Canceled my coverage because I was almost 18. My mom was also out of work for over 2 years, from 2001 to 2003... We've been everywhere, lived with my aunt for some time, and living with my grandparents now. My mom been apply for office type jobs, but since she has no college and only a GED.. it didn't come easy. the only thing my mom did was go to college on a pell grant, and with the pell grant, she got around $2000 each semister... she spent $800 on clases, and the rest was for her to keep... She bought a car because the 1993 corsica we had, had alot of problems. She bought a 1984 Lincoln Contional for $1200 or so... Other checks she helped pay bills for my grandparents since we stay here. She also worked with my aunt in gulf breeze, making a little extra pocket money... and she also cleaned some houses for my aunt and other realtors, again, making a little more money.<br /><br />So, I am limited on the jobs I can apply for... because of my knee. I was on Medicaid, but, my coverage expired when I turned 18. I also believe I have high blood pressure... I've been watching my blood pressure and it's been high, sometimes 160/85, and other times 140/94... It always changes. <br /><br />I don't have a car, I don't have my licence, and I really don't have any form of transportation in and out of the house. All I really do right now is stay at home day in and day out. I live in kinda a rural area, I live on Cerny Road if you guys know where it is at. There isn't anything within a decent walking distance of my house. Just a small small gas station, but they arn't even hiring. We used to have a small video store, and another gas station, but both have closed up. <br /><br />I would ask friends if I could get rides, or if they could put a good word in at their jobs, but, the problem is.. I've only got one friend, and he works at albertsons, and he can't even get more than a few hours of work a week. My mom works at wal-mart which I've appied for. My aunt is a realtor which lives in gulf breeze. <br /><br />Right now, I'm stuck... I'm at a very bad point in my life and I really don't know what to do. I worry about my knee if I did have a job... Because I know I can't get a office job. <br /><br />See, My problem is, I'm a very skillful person I believe... I've built a few computers, Worked on some, Upgraded some (Ram, Hard Drive, Video Card) and I even made a few web sites for some reators at my aunts office. I resale web hosting which makes me a little money... but only around $20 a month I make. I took me a year just to get two clients... the only thing is, my weak spot is linux... I don't know much about it... I've watned to learn, which is why I am a member here, but I just never got around to it. I like linux, and used it some, but just never got much into it. I would like to get a job like being a PC tech, but problem is, no place would hire me without a A+ Cert... I can't get by with just skill alone. <br /><br />Anyways, what do you guys suggest I do? I really need a job because there is no way my mom can keep going on like this... I hate seeing her come home in pain every day/night... My moms hours are different everyday, which makes it even more diffucult for me to find a job where I can get transportation from and to work. <br /><br />Thanks for taking the time to read this long time, and thanks in advance for the help and advice</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, it would seem that in your situation the best solution would be to get &quot;ANY&quot; job you can close to home for the time being. I'd try places like Tom Thumb, Taco Bell, etc. Most of these places are going to have some sort of health insurance that will kick in after 30 days or so. So, you'd have to tuff it out, and deal with the pain, until you can get your knee problems looked at under their health insurance. <br /><br />While at Tom Thumb or whatever, you can look for the job you'd like to be in. See, this kills a couple of birds with 1 stone. 1) You have a job. 2) You have health coverage. 3) You're saving money to get the inexpensive low end car you need.<br /><br />In order to make it easier on your Mom I'd look at ways to cut bills such as canceling Cable Internet and Cox Cable as well as curtailing computer purchases until everyone can back on their feet.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Also, if you are going to get your foot in the door in this biz any more, you absolutely *have* to get a degree. Entry level techs can get in if they are in college working towards some sort of certification, I think.<br /><br />College can take care of many of the issues you raise. First, it sounds like you'd qualify for all sorts of tuition assistance. There are also many scholarships that go un-applied for every year, many requiring only that you write a short essay. I think WalMart also has a tuition program for the dependents of their associates. Also, by attending UWF/PJC, you get access to health care for free and your dependents can go for cheap. I know, because thats how my family got medical care for almost a year. On top of all of that, Jerri Moers over at the co-op office bends over backwards to get students co-op jobs, many in civil service with the federal government (read &quot;cush&quot;).<br /><br />As for transportation, well, there's no easy answer. You could take some classes via the internet to save on travel time until you saved some money for a car/moped/whatever. If you went the college route, your tuition assistance can include housing on campus.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Alright here is my suggestion. My brother is currently in school to become a pharmacist. He has no job. He does however do much like your mother does. He gets loans for school only a percentage of it goes for school the rest goes for room and board. So in essense you could get a job to go to school. Now consequently you will have to pay it back. The idea is that after you get out of school you will be able to get a job that will pay for the loan payments. Also when you are in school their is alot of oppourtunities with co-op jobs and jobs right there on the campus that have to go to students before they look anywhere else. These jobs all have insurance. So my suggestion to you is to go to school. Go talk to a advisor they can help. There is also no telling what possible scholarships that you could get on top of your loans. <br /><br />Go to school.<br /><br />Trigger<br /><br />If this seems like a good idea. You need to go right now and apply for financial aid. It takes time to get that processed.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for the replies and suggestions...<br /><br />Yeah, School does seem like a good idea... As things stand, I might be able to get on a pell grant... where I won't need to pay back. I did have plans to go to college, and even started the applying things... but, i just never finished because my mom dropped out of school... which I was going to set up my classes to be around the same time as hers, so I could have a ride. Good thing is, if I did go, I might get a grant like my mom did. where I would get alot of money which was left over... This way, I could buy a cheap car for around $1000 just enough to get back and forth... Then next go around, I'll get a better laptop for collge.... two major things on my list if I do go...<br /><br />It does seem like a good option... Not many people in my family went to college... so, It would be really good for me I think :-)</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Don't stop at grants. Apply for any and all financial aide. There are also many books and websites that tell you about available scholarships. The application for State FA will come back with all the money the state will give you.<br /><br />Don't be afraid of *Subsidized* Student Loans (don't get the un-subsidized kind). Like Trigger said, you won't have to start paying these back until 6 mos. after you graduate (ok, you will be required to start making payments if you drop below 1/2 time for more than 6 mos, but you can defer your payments if you start up again). The state pays the interest (which is low) on the loan while you are in school so your lender is happy. What's more, you can elect a &quot;graduated&quot; payment schedule in which your monthly payments start out low and gradually increase every couple of years or so. Finally, you have, like, 30 years to pay it back.<br /><br />Again, apply for anything and everything, even if you don't think you qualify. If you get some money with terms you don't think you like, you can always decline *after* you have been awarded but *before* the money is disbursed.<br /><br />After that, all you have to do is go to class and pass your courses. ;)<br /><br />PS. Skip the laptop, live on campus, and use the labs!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here's my advice..... &nbsp;I'm not much older than you, but it may help.....<br /><br /><br />Tom Thumb pays little per hour, but they have good benefits. &nbsp;Medical, dental, optical, and life insurance kick in after 90 days. &nbsp;PJC has a school to work type program. &nbsp;It shouldn't be too hard to get you a pell grant as you live with your parents and you haven't ever had a job. &nbsp;I would suggest taking the ECAT to the closest PJC cmpus and go talk to student affairs and finance...... &nbsp;They may be able to help you out a lot. &nbsp;I would recommend using public transportation for a while. &nbsp;It's cheap and you can go anywhere in Escambia. &nbsp;hmmmmm......... &nbsp;I agree woth the bills idea.... &nbsp;try to get rid of all that you don't need..... &nbsp;cable, phone extras, etc... &nbsp;If you read this in the next few days, email me at dragon_hunter@mchsi.com. &nbsp;I may be able to get you a job somewhere...... &nbsp;I can try to pull a few strings...... &nbsp;:wink: &nbsp;Oh, one more thing.... &nbsp;DON'T GET A BETTER LAPTOP...... &nbsp;I may be able to arrange to get you a desktop for nothing which is very basic, but good for school.....</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ya, I agree, yet amongst the disenfranchised and suffering, there are million dollar homes going up all over northwest florida? Look at that Aragorn complex downtown, that used to be a government housing project, and all the prosperity of the bldgs down off of Palafox where Network Telephone, etc. is located.. just across the street from my brothers 40yr old $40k home we purchased 17 years ago, are $300K+ homes w. Hummers, BMW's and Mercedes Benz in the driveway, some w. ALL THREE!?!<br /><br />When I moved back from the Bay Area, I saw my first street beggar on the way to the 3 mile bridge.. I'd never seen an overtly homeless person in Pensacola before. The couple looked exactly like the couples I'd seen of 19th street on my way to San Francisco. &nbsp;<br /><br />I recently saw the stats on homelessness in Escarosa County, it has doubled in size...<br /><br />Kid, if you ever come back to &nbsp;viewing this, here's a helpful link for local job training and assistance: http://www.escarosa.org/services.htm<br /><br />The widening gap between the rich and the poor, is happening right before our eyes here in Pensacola.. What is the cause of this???</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey Guys...<br /><br />Yes, I owe you guys a very long story. So here goes.<br /><br />I made the first post in May of last year. My mom was working at wal-mart at the time, and I applied for the electrions Dept... I didn't get the job. <br /><br />Sooo... I laid around the house, doing nothing with my life until around Augest. Without my knowing, my mom filled out a job app in my name for the seafood dept up where she works. My mom works in the deli. The deli, seafood, meat, 97 wall is all one division. She then went to her division mananger to tell him i applied there... he then ran to personal. I had job interviews, got hired while billy (division manager) was on vacation...<br /><br />My first day was ROUGH needless to say. It had to be the worst day of my life. I honestly didn't think I could make it, but I kept at it. <br /><br />I've now been working at wal-mart for 6 months stable. I've had one raise, and the divison mananger said he put me in for another raise a few days ago. <br /><br />It's been rough, One time I worked two back to back 12 hour days, and worked 12 days stright... when my dept mananger's grandson was in the hospital. <br /><br />My life has changed greatly. I helped my mom get a new car, she now drives a 2001 ford focus wagon... It had a lot of miles when we bought it, but none the less, we got a good deal on it and it runs great.<br /><br />This friday, I'm going to be planning on buying a car. <br /><br />I also now have health insurence... I weighed 210 lbs when i made the first post here... i now weigh 193 or so. Not a massive difference, but a lot better none the less. My blood pressure went WAY down, I am now around 127/74 or so. <br /><br />My grandparents have been very understanding and they let my mom take their truck when me and my mom work different hours.<br /><br />Yes, I've got my drivers licence. :-) <br /><br />Also, My best friend now works at wal-mart... I helped him get a job there as well. <br /><br />Overall, Things have been great. My knee isn't doing that bad so far. I pull heavy 1500 lb pallets around work, carry 50 lb boxes... and my knee is doing good so far (crosses fingers) <br /><br />I love working at wal-mart. I work with some of the greatest people. I look forward going to work, and often don't even want to leave because we have so much fun up there :-) The people make the difference as the logo says :-) <br /><br />Umm... Not much else to say really. <br /><br />I would also like to thank everyone here for your support... You guys helped me out a lot and helped changed me life.<br /><br />Once I get my own car, Hopefully I would like to take time to learn linux and visit with you guys. My work schedule isn't the best... so i dunno how I will be able to work that in, but I will figure out a way. <br /><br />Once again guys, Thanks soooo much for your support. And I'm sorry for not checking back sooner. I went into a really depressed state for a few months, and since I've been working, I pretty much live up at wal-mart :-) <br /><br />Take care guys, I will check back soon... very soon... not months this time... :-)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay... An update! Yeppie!<br /><br />First off, Once again Thanks for your support. This has got to be the longest lasting post ever...<br /><br />I recently bought my own car... a 2004 Chevy Aveo. I wish I didn't go new, but I like being able to have a warrenty, and my payments are only $260, which would be around the same for a used car... just my payments are a lot longer :-\ <br /><br />Also to boot... I have plans to be moving out soon with a good friend of mine which also works at Wal-Mart. So I'll be out on my own soon hopefully... It's truely amazing how much things can change in such a short period of time.<br /><br />I've been at my job almost a year... Will be a year in Augest. <br /><br />I'm in the market for a new job... I like what I do, I enjoy everyone I work with... but a lot has been going on and we've just been really short handed... We are 9 people short right now between Meat, Seafood, Deli. Company Policy says we can't work more than 6 hours without a lunch... I hit 6 and half hours the other day because I had no one to relieve me in my area.<br /><br />If anyone knows of any places which is hiring... Please let me know :-) I'm willing to take a low paying job, just as long as it's a lower stress job.<br /><br />Running two depts isn't fun when one dept does $15,000 in sales a day :-\ Went into work today and there was no one there... when usually there is 3 people opening... I was stuck opening Seafood and meat... Fun Fun Fun.<br /><br />Okay, Enough of my complaining... If you guys know of anything, Hit me up. I have several refs, resume... Thanks once again guys... You've made a huge change in my life and my survival...</div>

One of his techs just moved to Orlando for a new IT job, and they have a full bench w. steady business customers who require onsite IT support, so they need more inhouse techs to man the house.<br /><br />CU actually is three partners, w. three offices, Mobile, AL, Daphne, AL, and Pensacola, FL. The owner of the Pensacola office came from the Mobile office. They've been in operation in Pensacola for about three years now (they've moved 3x, on to better and better locations each time). The Mobile office has a couple of whale clients, one of which is a large multinational shipping company, so sometimes the lead techs are sent out to Canada for jobs like setting up a remote access router to a new office, setting up a 10-15 person LAN, etc. CU is the completely outsourced IT department for that shipping company. &nbsp;If you shine, and I feel that you will, you may get up to that level in a short while. :)<br /><br />P.S. PM me, and I'll give you the contact info/name of the owner. I've known him for 25 yrs.<br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br />ms</div>
