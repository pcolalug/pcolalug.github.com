					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">By: Brett Hoff<br /><br />I have gathered here a collection of scripts and notes on using SSH and X together as a sort of thin client.<br /><br />Note: before starting the following project you should have X-forwarding turned on in the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.<br />X11Forwarding yes<br />If you had to add this line then you will need to restart sshd<br />service sshd restart<br /><br />Working from your workstation you need to bring up your server located elsewhere. You would like to bring up X try the following.<br /><br />startX /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm<br /><br />This will give you a plain jane x desktop with nothing running with no window control at all.<br />Connect to your server using openssh<br />ssh -C -x -l username server_name<br /><br />The C option sets up data compression in the secure data stream.<br />The X option enables the forwarding of X request.<br /><br />Once you find yourself at the command prompt you can start a desktop session by typing the following.<br /><br />startkde or wmaker or which ever one you prefer etc.......<br />You should now be running a full graphical desktop from your server!<br /><br />This is very handy and if you would like to have one screen for your workstation and one for your server just open another virtual consoles and start a second X session like this.<br /><br />startx /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm --:1<br /><br />The --:1 brings up a second graphical desktop<br /><br />That should do you. Hopes it workes as good for you as it has worked for me.<br /><br /><br />SSH password schemes<br /><br />Instead of passwords you can use keys to log onto machines.<br />first you must use ssh-keygen to generate your keys.<br />Note: if you enter a passphrase when ask it will ask you for that passphrase each and everytime you try to connect to that machine.<br />If you do want that headache just leave it blank.<br />Two keys will be generated your private key will be stored in ~/.ssh/identity . The public key will be stored in ~/.ssh/indentity.pub<br />The public key must be placed into the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys of the machine you are connecting to in order to work.<br />This allows for connection via RSA auth vs. passwords.<br /><br /><br />SSH Tunneling<br /><br />ssh -2 -N -F -L 5023:localhost:23 user@foo.example.com<br /><br />This sets a secure tunnel for telnet<br />the -2 forces ssh to use the version 2 protocol<br />the -N indicates no command<br />the -F forces ssh to run in the background<br />the -L indicates a local tunnel<br />user@fooexample.com the remote ssh server<br /><br />This works by creating a listen port on the local machine on a specfic port it then forwards any connection recieved to the specified port via ssh.<br />In the example above port 5023 is being forwarded to port 23 which is telnet you now have a ssh secured telnet session.<br /><br />Bypassing a Draconian firewall using the above.<br />perhaps you want to access your streaming music from work but they are only allowing port 80 and 22 for web traffic.<br />well then try this. <br />ssh -2 -N -F -L 8888:music.example.com:8000 user@unfirewalled.myserver<br />your streaming client can now be pointed to localhost port 8888 which will be forwarded over to music.example.com port 8000<br />evading the firewall.<br /><br />~brett~</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I use this feature all the time to run red-carpet on headless servers:<br /><br />localhost% startx<br />localhost% ssh erc@remote<br />remote% red-carpet<br /><br />Assuming you've got X11 forwarding set to &quot;Yes&quot; on remote, it works like a charm.</div>
