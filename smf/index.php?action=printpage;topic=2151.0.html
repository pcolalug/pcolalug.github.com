					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok folks,<br /><br />I am no longer your resident Aerospace Engineering Major (it still hurts to say that). &nbsp;I have finally given in to the endless onslaught of calculus and physics.<br /><br />Back when I was in high school I always said I would either work computers to support a hobby in aviation, or work aviation to support a hobby in computers. &nbsp;I guess the former is in effect.<br /><br />I'm thinking hard about going into Computer Information Systems (CS w a busness flavor). &nbsp;My major concern, however, is the availibility of CS jobs given the problems with the bubble burst and the Offshoring of IT. &nbsp;What is the outlook for the CS field in the next 10, 20, 30 years? &nbsp;I've heard a LOT of bad things about the future of CS.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Learn to speak another language, maybe Mandarin Chinese or Urdu. Just kidding. Despite the poor outlook in CS, that does not mean that it will be impossible to get a job in the field. It will be nearly impossible to get into a firm at the bottom and work your way up to the top in that same firm. Be willing to diversify (get an MS in a lateral career field), or be willing to move. This is true of any career field that has been given a poor outlook. Besides, a lot of the &quot;official reports&quot; are making things out to be worse than they really are.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">From everything I've read, it is all going to depend on what you want to do. CIS isn't going to put you into the programming world, where a lot of the jobs are being outsourced. You also won't be working a call center, so that puts you somewhere in the great realm of administration. As long as companies keep servers and networks going in their offices, you will have a job as an admin. Even if you go to work for some place that does outsourced administration (for a local area), you'll still have a job. Not everything is going to go overseas. <br /><br />One thing that I see on the horizon and perhaps this is just a dream is this. Yes, outsourcing to cheap employment overseas sounds great on paper. Talking to a manager type for a software dev company, he hates it. He says you may pay a programmer in the states the same as four programmers over in India, but you get the same output from that one programmer in the states as you would from those four in India. Not to mention the difficulties with languages and the time differences and the cultural differences. I think society here in the states is going to get fed up with losing jobs to cheap labor abroad and finally realize that there are things our government can do to put pressure on these companies to keep jobs here. Either that or we will all be looking at hard times, not just in the world of computers, but across the board.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">As a Fall 2004 UWF CIS Graduate, there are jobs to be found. The question is, what are you willing to accept for pay. Fortunately, my case is extremely skewed, as I have over 19 years experience in IT &amp; programming jobs when I decided (actually, my employer requested) that I finish my degree so that my resume could be used in proposals where a degree is a requirement. The difference between a large pizza and someone with no prior experience is that the pizza will feed a family of four. In Pensacola, expect starting salaries around the $30-35k mark. When I began with my employer, even with my 14 years experience, I was still in the 30's. If you are looking to start somewhere in the $50k+ relatively close by, look towards Atlanta, St Petersburg, Orlando and Tampa. I've gotten offers in the $125k range in Tampa, but from what I can tell it is not a cheap place to live, and I had a bad vibe about the prospective employer. Otherwise I'd probably not be here in Pensacola now.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Locally, your track at school means less than the degree itself. If your major is computer-related (CIS, CS, CE, yadda^2), you could be doing just about anything from programming to admin. We've got two CIS majors in my shop. Both are programmers and one spends lots of time doing database stuff. The db guy spent time doing sysadmin during his internship, so there's not a lot of discernment wrt degree program that I've seen. However, this market isn't great to begin with, so I would sugguest that if you're around here, at least do a co-op with the federal government. If you're lucky, you'll get to go over to Corey and do neat crypto stuff. If not, the worst case is that you get some experience to add to the CV when you graduate and can be reasonably assured of a job with the government if you don't/can't find anything else.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Getting a company to sponsor your security clearance (even if you have to work on a contract basis at first) will open a great many doors to you. I've personally seen it, and even for guys w. no college degree, but plenty of IT experience from the military.. that secret clearance alone got my hourly to almost 85% of what I was making in the SF Bay Area. :)<br /><br />UNISYS, SAIC, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, Anteon, EDS, etc. etc.. Former big defense contractors, and large IT government contractors are taking it in these days. Only type of environment where I've seen guys &nbsp;talking about 1st $80k tax free when working overseas... Some IT contractors working in DC for say DHS, TSA, etc are pulling down $160/170k w. overtime (60+hr workweek) I've been told, by folks who were just salaried IT workers hoofing it for the master contractor.<br /><br />Depends on your personal way of life of course. :)</div>

It &nbsp;is an off the top blanket tax deduction. This keeps you from having to worry about receipts and such. Since you are also not using up US tax dollars to function in every day life they give you a break. Not sure all the reasons for it, but I accept it.<br /><br />Don't mean to highjack the topic (I do that sometimes) so I will make a positive comment in that realm.<br /><br />Brent, just finish something. As was mentioned earlier in this thread, the degree is more important than the major. Finishing will go a long way. I know many who have good jobs not in the field in which they studied. But they would not have gotten their jobs without having finished school.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Brett,<br /><br />Here's something to ponder. One of the previous post said something about going to work for the government. I work in a shop that is full of those guys, it's not a bad way to go at all, unless you just don't like the military that much. Check http://www.usajobs.opm.gov/ and look through their database. I considered the same degree, and compared it to engineering ( I kinda liked the math) and I used mechanical because it seemed to be the most diverse engineering degree. Here's what I found:<br /><br />Without &quot;Vet's preference&quot; or some other appointment eligability the IT jobs had 227 open while ME only had 88 open. BUT, I do have vet's pref so I ran that also and it changed drastically to IT = 559 and ME = 783. The important thing about that system is getting your foot in the door though. A few of the jobs they had open around this area required either an MS or a few years exp, but started around 40-45k. And quite a few of them required 15 hours of integral calc, I don't if they considered DE or not, they have been still using the quarter system for all I know. If you can land one of those jobs, even if the pay isn't what you want you'll meet a lot of contractors like Lockheed Martin that are making really good money and you'll be in a great spot to jump into a better position should a better paying job opn up.<br /><br />jaymz</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It will depend on how you apply your degree. Yes all the IT jobs will go overseas because of cheap labor and good people in India. But not cleared ones.<br />&nbsp; Try this...If you can get in with Lockheed Martin for a cleared job would be a good deal. They have some kind of deal where they pay you while you wait for your clearance. I seen loads of them when I was in Hanover Maryland on my way to Japan. Then if someting else comes up you can bail out, of course once your cleared. <br />&nbsp; Also not all overseas jobs have a 80k exemption any more. Our contract has just gone to Tax Equalization starting '05. Its suposse to be a good deal, we'll see!<br />&nbsp; There are other simular jobs like UNIX administrator you might think about. I get bombarded with e-mail asking me to go to DC and Maryland for Sys admin jobs. &nbsp;I wouldn't go there for any amount money!!!!<br />&nbsp; Keep looking around and making connections something good will eventually happen.<br /><br />&nbsp; Alan</div>
