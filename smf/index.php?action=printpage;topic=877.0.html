					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi guys,<br /><br />I might get to come to the lug meeting this sat. (I usually go home on the weekend.) &nbsp;I'm currently having some problems (hardware) on my laptop. &nbsp;The CD ROM is going out (it will only read my slackware install disks strangely...I'm just glad it will read those. &nbsp;Also it cuts off randomly without warning...I think it's the same power supply problem that they were supposed to fix the last time I sent it off.<br /><br />I'm currently trying to do a net install of debian with floppy disks. &nbsp;I don't believe I'm saying this but, slackware is actually easier to install than debian is! &nbsp;Granted I LOVE the pkg management. &nbsp;<br /><br />Right now I'm running off of my slack live cd as it doesn't mind the random crashes I'm experiencing...it's actually behaving itself now...strange<br /><br />I'm going to go by the uwf library and check out running linux 3rd edition tomarrow.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">For this next lug meeting...could you guys bring in ur distro cd's? &nbsp;I'm specifically interested in deb, mandrake, and slack 9, although any up to date distro that can be read by my problematic cdrw is welcome. &nbsp;<br /><br />Also, I've had the slack live cd up for like 12 hours now. &nbsp;Quite amazing given the number of mysterious blank screen o death I've gotten with installed slack and deb. &nbsp;I think I might try reinstalling slack 8.1</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sure, I can burn a CD or two for you. &nbsp;The ISOs I have on disc right now are:<br /><br />Slackware 9.0<br />Mandrake 9.1<br />Redhat 9.0 (Three disks)<br /><br />So take your pick, and I'll be sure to bring it to the next meeting.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">yes of course.<br /><br />Btw could i bring my laptop to Oscars? &nbsp;That way I could tell then and there if the iso would work or not. &nbsp;(sounds strange but I've tried knoppix and gentoo and they don't work on this cdrom...while they work on other ppl's. &nbsp;Also...bit of a stretch but would they happen to have a wifi network around....no prob not.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Laptops are more than welcome at the meetings. You should have been there the first time an Apple PowerBook showed up! You'd think $ATTRACTIVE_PERSON walked in the door! As for wifi, we'll let the neighborhood speak for itself there...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Good luck on the Wi-Fi at Oscars. &nbsp;We tried to use an 802.11a network at the church across the street with no success. &nbsp;Step outside Oscars and take a look at the antenna/microwave/cell tower to the east. &nbsp;The best we could ever do was to get one computer up at a time and that at a poor speed. &nbsp;After six months of going round and round we figured it must be interference from that tower. &nbsp;:cry:</div>

I'm no electrician, but I doubt that the wiring in that place is up to code. Bring your rig and we'll unplug the iBook and projector after the presentation.</div>
