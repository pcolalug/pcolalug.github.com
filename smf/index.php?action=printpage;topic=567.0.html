					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I dunno maybe this should have gone under Gnome instead of Slackware? &nbsp;Oh well, it's a slackware specific gnome distro so here ya go. &nbsp;I've installed Slackware 9 with Dropline Gnome and capture some screenshots for you guys to see...<br /><br />http://www.homeweb.org/~imnes/slackware/9.0-shots/<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">*And the town's people rejoice*<br /><br />I am no longer running Windows! I have Slack 9 installed with Dropline Gnome. There are several things I'm working on. You guys might be able to help me here since I am new to this linux desktop thingy. <br /><br />First, Flash isn't wanting to install properly. It is saying I need a newer version of glibc. I have 2.2.5 that comes with Slack 9 and it is saying I need 2.2. Um...maybe you guys can give me a hand there.<br /><br />Second, where is a good place to find slackware packages of some of the more popular programs such as Evolution? That is my email client of choice, but have only found RPMs and DEBs. There are some others that aren't included in the basic slackware set. If I can't find anything good, you guys might find a new repository of unofficial packages soon.<br /><br />Third, getting Phoenix to use AA fonts! I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I guess I don't know the correct path to my fonts. *shrug*<br /><br />Last, where can I find xwd. I didn't get anything to do any screen captures for you and can't find one. I think I'm just searching wrong. Imnes, I know you can help me on this one.<br /><br />Anyway, other than that, I got the new Nvidia drivers installed fairly easily and I'm rocking along with a very pretty and fast desktop. Why do I feel like I'm sounding like n00b? :P Later!<br /><br />(edit) I also forgot, I need to get my scrollwheel to work...but I will get that. I'm sure it is just picking the right protocol. It's one of those damned MS Optical Intellimice</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">To capture a screenshot click on the &quot;Actions&quot; menu then hit &quot;Screen Shot&quot;. &nbsp;:) &nbsp;<br /><br />For slackware packages I like to visit www.linuxpackages.net, there are a few more sites but I'll have to wait 'til I'm on the laptop to get the URLs for you.<br /><br />For evolution you'll need to install some gnome1 packages - I did it and it's not very difficult I'll post you some directions for that later.<br /><br />I don't use phoenix so I can't help you with that.<br /><br />As far as Flash I'm not sure how it's installed. &nbsp;If it's using an installer / script you'll need to edit it (I had a similar problem with another program I wanted to install. &nbsp;I'll look into it tonight and see if I can figure it out).<br /><br />Is your mouse working? &nbsp;You might also need to add <br />Option &quot;Buttons&quot; &quot;5&quot; or something like that? &nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway I'll have better answers for you when I get on my linux system. &nbsp;Good luck,<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yeah...should have looked at that menu a little better and yes I did get the scroll wheel to work. Working on evolution still. I'll look at the flash installer script.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I got flash installed. I just commented out the section that checked glibc. I also got Evolution, but the only available packages for Slack 9 were for the unstable 1.3. Yes, it is still very unstable. It didn't like the responses from my pop server. I guess cox uses a weird server implementation. I have webmail, so that is all good. Here are some screenshots of my desktop. My complaint with Mandrake 8 about the desktop not being consistent is fixed with Dropline.<br /><br />http://members.cox.net/dgivens4/new_drop.png<br /><br />http://members.cox.net/dgivens4/typical.png<br /><br />http://members.cox.net/dgivens4/crowded.png<br /><br />Those are all in 1600x1200, so they are rather large. I'm a bit too lazy to resize them down.</div>
