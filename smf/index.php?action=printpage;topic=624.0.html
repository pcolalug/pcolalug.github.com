					Title: <b>UPDATED: O'Reilly Books free for review</b><br />

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">OK, not totally free. They ask one thing of us. We need to write a review.<br /><br />We can request any book as long as you want to write a reveiw for it. Don't get scared, it can be as simple as writing a review for our library (http://www.pcolalug.org/library) saying if you liked it and why... or if you didn't and why. We need to send a copy of the review to O'Reilly. But beyond that there are no strict requirements.<br /><br />They have recommended that we read /.'s book review policy (http://slashdot.org/book.review.guidelines.shtml). We do not have to strictly adhere to /.'s guidelines, but it will give you some ideas as to what to write. Also, we would like to post reviews to Amazon's site. Any other site that you would like to post your review to is fair game. <br /><br />Here is part of an e-mail that I received from our contact, Marsee Henon:<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: Marsee from O'Reilly</div><div class="quote">We love to have people post reviews on their group's web site, newsletter, discussion lists. But we also love it when your members post reviews of our books on other sites such as Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, Slashdot, or their own web sites.<br /></div><br />Let me know the books that you want to review and we will send one big order every few weeks. I would like to keep them from having to ship several individual books.<br /><br /><b>Update</b><br />We have decided to allow the people who request the book be able to own the book. Once a book is received by the reviewer, that starts a four month clock. During that time we ask that you have the book reviewed (very quickly after receiving it) and that the book belong to the group library. After the four months, the book will go to the ownership of the reviewer.<br /><br />See this as an opportunity to build your own library as well as help the group and O'Reilly. It will be a help to the group since the book will be available to us for the four months. It will be a help to O'Reilly to have more reviews of their books on the book seller's sites.<br /><br />If you do request a review book, please do not request another till your review is written.</div>
