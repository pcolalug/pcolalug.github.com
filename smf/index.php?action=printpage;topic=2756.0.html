					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Since with the purchase of my laptop I have never bought a computer all my equipment has been donated.<br />I am now looking at building a dream system for my company. I have been looking at Linux mag. machines for the last two years and also all the major <br />makers stock machines...So here is your question.<br />Let&#039;s post your dream machine here, But specify why you would choose those parts.<br />I am looking for raid system with atleast 4gig ram and dual head. <br />I leave you with that.<br /><br /><br />Should have specified 3200.00 price tag</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would take the easy, but expensive route and configure a dream machine at alienware.com. For ~only~ $6000, you too can have a dual-head, 64-bit, 4G RAM, liquid-cooled machine. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I will say this first....my dream system ain&#039;t cheap. Here is a run down and I&#039;ll explain more after. <br /><br />$1,324.00 each &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2x Dual-Core AMD Opteron 880 (2.4 Ghz/2MB L2 Cache/1000Mhz HT)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.amdcompare.com/us-en/opteron/details.aspx?opn=OSA880FAA6CC<br />$558.00 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tyan Thunder K8WE (S2895) Motherboard<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.tyan.com/products/html/thunderk8we.html<br />$310.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3Ware 9550SX-4LP Serial ATA II RAID 5 Controller<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.3ware.com/products/serial_ata2-9000.asp<br />$300.00 each&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4x WD Digital Raptor WD1500ADFD 150GB 10,000 RPM HD<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.westerndigital.com/en/products/Products.asp?DriveID=189&amp;Language=en<br />$452.99 each&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2x Crucial 2GB kit (1GBx2) ECC/Reg DDR400<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://xrl.us/jhda (Link to www.crucial.com)<br />$459.00 each&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2x EVGA Geforce 7800GTX 256MB GDDR3 in SLI<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.evga.com/products/moreinfo.asp?pn=256-P2-N528-AX<br />$629.00 each &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2x Dell UltraSharp 2001FP 20.1&quot; LCD Display<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://xrl.us/jhc9 (Link to accessories.us.dell.com)<br />$179.00 each&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2x Plexton PX-716AL DL-DVD Burner<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.plextor.com/english/products/716AL.htm<br /><br />Total $8155.98<br /><br />I didn&#039;t include soundcard, case, power supply or any accessories such as mouse/keyboard/etc.<br /><br />Now to explain why I chose what I chose. Well, who can complain about 4 Operton processors. Over the top, yes, but that is some power. The motherboard was mostly for the 64bit PCI-X and it has strong linux support from the manufacturer. It runs the Nvidia NForce Pro chipset providing dual 16x PCI-Express ports and dual gigabit lan. You have two independent banks of memory, one for each memory slot and can go up to 16GB of registered DDR400 memory. I picked 4GB of Crucial memory (2 2GB kits), so each dual-core processor will have 2GB each. The drives are fast and combined with the SATA RAID are capable of RAID5. Can&#039;t complain there. Dual EVGA 7800GTX&#039;s because SLI between those will make Quake4 run sooo nicely. 512MB on those would be overkill (as if everything else isn&#039;t), and the benchmarks haven&#039;t shown a huge advantage to going with 512MB yet. The Dell displays run at a max of 1600x1200, so no funky resolutions to fight with, just straight up Xinerama 3200x1200 in X.org. No muss, no fuss. Finally Plextor DL-DVD burners because they are the best, hands down. <br /><br />For case and powersupply, I would recommend a redundant powersupply solution and a large open case with plenty of cooling. Between four drives, four processors and two video cards, not only will you need space, but you need to get some air through there. I&#039;m not a big fan of watercooling (can you say leaks) and I wouldn&#039;t want to overclock this system because it doesn&#039;t need it. Larger fans will move more air and produce less noise, so I would look into that. <br /><br />But to be honest, for a business workstation, I would really look into Sun&#039;s Opteron workstations or a Dell workstation. Why? Support! I would seriously consider having a maintenance contract on any hardware that is vital to a business. It&#039;s so nice having gold support from Dell on our servers at work because we have parts or service in less than 4 hours. No wait times when we call them and it&#039;s always someone who has a firm grasp of the English language on the other end. <br /><br />So there you have it. Hope you&#039;ve enjoyed my hour and a half of research. Best of luck with whatever you get.<br /><br />One final note, don&#039;t buy Alienware...way overpriced and definitely not geared for anything other than gaming.</div>
