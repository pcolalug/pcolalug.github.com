					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi,<br /><br />I just purchased a shiny new server that I will use as a file server and for developing web apps. I want to be able to dual boot between a Windows 2000 and Red Hat setup depending on the type of development I'm doing. <br /><br />Could I get some suggestions on partitioning and setup and maybe once my Win2K comes in help in actually setting it up?<br /><br />Network:<br />4-port Linksys Wireless Router<br /><br />Server:<br />Intel Celeron 1.7G<br />512 RAM<br />80GB HD<br />Motherboard IBM D845GEBV2 (on board everything)<br /><br />RedHat Config:<br />RH 7.2<br />Apache 1.x<br />MySQL<br />PHP<br /><br />Windows Config:<br />Windows 2000 Server<br />SQL Server 2000 Dev<br />IIS<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />Jamie</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well technically (is that spelled right?) you don't have to dual boot. &nbsp;You could run apache+mysql+php on windows, and you could run an ASP server in linux (chilisoft I think). &nbsp;Or even better, you could run linux and have it start up a vmware copy of win2k once it boots. &nbsp;:)<br /><br />But if you must dual boot...<br /><br />You have 80g. &nbsp;You could have gotten by with 6g or less probably. &nbsp;So you could just split the drive in half give each OS 40g. &nbsp;But to give yourself some convenience in the future, I would say give linux 10g, windows 10g, then have a 3rd partition of type FAT32 where your /home (and other handy locations) from linux go, and your windows web directories go. &nbsp;That way if you have something screw up, you could reload linux, windows, or both, and have your web data intact. &nbsp;Just a thought.<br /><br />If it were my system, given your massive ram, HD, and quick CPU. &nbsp;I would actually probably just partition all 80gb out to linux. &nbsp;Do a base system install that does nothing but have your base software on it (and Xwindows). &nbsp;Then actually run another Linux server, and your Win2k server from vmware. &nbsp;That way you could restart / switch servers (or have both running at once) without having to reboot your machine at all. &nbsp;And as long as vmware runs happily you could reload your vmware'd servers and really never have to actually touch the main software of the machine :) &nbsp;<br /><br />Of course I'm not sure how much vmware costs and if you'd want to buy more software. &nbsp;Sorry, but I like doing geeky stuff like that. &nbsp;<br /><br />Nick</div>
