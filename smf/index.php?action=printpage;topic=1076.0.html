					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hmm, well, this week got insanely busy, and I utterly forgot about the meeting till I came to look at the forums, realized what today was, and realized we're supposed to meet tomorrow.As to wether I'll be there, I have no clue. I figure at this point, it's probably too late to see if any of you live close enough for me to tag along, and not sure I can bribe one of my &quot;wonderful&quot; family members to take me, but we'll see. <br /><br />This has been one of those weeks that has made me want to run screaming:p:)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I know we discussed this before, but I forgot. What part of town do you live in? I won't be able to help, but maybe someone else will. Let us know where and maybe we can hook you up with someone in your neighborhood.<br /><br />Anyone else need a ride? I volunteer any of our members to help. :lol:</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Trigger...you need to edit your post and get your number and email off of there. Several search engines crawl our forums and you don't want to get that stuff out there so people can start annoying you.</div>
