					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I can save you the time and effort. It doesn&#039;t have any webcam support or voice or anything other than the basic ability to send messages. I don&#039;t think that yahoo&#039;s version of messenger has even been updated in about two years. If all you want to do on yahoo messenger is send messages, use pidgin. If you want to go through the hassle of getting a webcam to work on yahoo messenger from linux, then your best hope is kopete. I have had it working before, but it was a bit of a pain. I think the most recent versions of kopete are getting better, but I haven&#039;t tested it in about six months I would say nor have I really been keeping up. I wish the pidgin guys would borrow the webcam code from kopete(not sure if that isn&#039;t a priority or if it is a licensing issue or what), but as much as I love kde, I don&#039;t care for kopete.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">from Pidgins FAQ:<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">We plan to implement these features eventually, but it is a daunting task. Not all of our developers care about these features, and because of that don&#039;t want to work on them. The time available to those developers who do want to work on these features is limited, and so any work on these features proceeds slowly. <br /><br />We aim to have an abstracted, protocol-agnostic API for voice and video, which makes the task harder. Also adding to the difficulty is that now that we have a completely split core (libpurple) and UI (Pidgin and Finch), we refuse to take a step backward and violate this split. The protocol plugins can NOT have any code in them that is UI-dependent, or we break the libpurple/UI split. This imposes additional restrictions that make it a very painstaking process to implement voice and video correctly. <br /><br />In short, we have no idea when this will happen. It could be tomorrow, or it could be in 2099. That&#039;s really the best answer we can give right now. <br /></div><br />Its too bad to hear about yahoo messenger. I would like too see a good webcam program if not just to watch other peoples....<br /><br />Of course I am sure there are other reasons, long distance relatives/relationships, army friends/lovers, um....and....something anyway....</div>
