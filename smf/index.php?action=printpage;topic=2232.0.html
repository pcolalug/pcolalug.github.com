					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Actually, the database is on the same machine, but I'm thinking the issue is something with the phpBB posting verification/reverse DNS type function that is slow to come back. I've been meaninig to look at it but just haven't had time lately.<br /><br />I'll get to it this evening and see what I can do to speed up the posting process.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Let's see.<br /><br /><b>edit</b><br />Well, it took a while to post the first version of this post (maybe a minute and a half). So, I really don't see it as any faster. On the other hand, I don't know how much time it normally takes. Since I use a tabbed browser, I send off the post and go and look at something else. Sometimes it is several mintutes to several hours before I come back to that tab to see if the post happended.<br /><br />So...<br />1. I didn't know that there was a problem previously.<br />2. I don't know what would be a normal post time, but it still seems slow.<br /><br /><b>edit II</b><br />The second posting of this (first edit) took 3 seconds. So I will take all of this as inconclusive. It could have been a hiccup in the sending of my first version that caused it to take so long. But 3 seconds is certainly acceptable.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: steve</div><div class="quote">Browser sat there saying &quot;Waiting for www.pcolalug.org&quot;</div><br />That is what mine did. I have posted 4 or 5 more posts since then and they all have been quick (2 to 5 second range).<br /><br />Edit<br />Well, so much for that. This one took 56 seconds to post. That is an unofficial time, but a good proximation. I expected it to just go and when it took more time I started counting.<br /><br />If we keep this up our post count will read 20,000 before we finish this thread.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm just testing this out myself...will edit with results.<br /><br />Edit: 53 seconds before the page started loading for the confirmation. Maybe an addition to the hosts file would help this or using IP address in the config. I know that could be a pain should you change IP scheme later (I know, because I just did it), but it may speed things up some.<br /><br />Further Edit: I just posted a reply in another section and at the same time did a refresh of the index and noticed that it showed a new post by me in that section. This was before it even started loading the post confirmation. Could it be that the update is being made to the db, but for some reason, the server isn't redirecting fast enough?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just did some research over at the PHPbb support forums and found a couple of possible reasons for the &quot;long posting times&quot;.<br /><br />The first possible cause states that it may have to do with someone watching a thread and a problem with the smtp mail software. ie. PHPbb trying to send an email that the thread has been updated.<br /><br />The second, and more logical reason, states to check and make sure you are running the latest version of PHP with the latest version of Apache. There are reported problems with older versions of PHP running on older versions of Apache 2.x.x.<br /><br />Here &nbsp;(http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=142826&amp;highlight=submit+long)is the first solution I found.<br /><br />Here &nbsp;(http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=106159&amp;highlight=submit+long)is the second solution I found.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">For that server, it is running:<br /><br />PHP 4.3.5<br />Apache 1.3.29<br /><br />I don't think that is the problem, but the mail server could very well be the issue. It stays pretty busy so I'll start looking that direction.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just my uninformed opinion, it seems that it is probably the email situation. And, it makes sense. The reason the subsequent posts (edits) do not take as long, is that everyone that was watching that topic has already gotten the notification that it has been updated. But when Steve posts after me, it takes a bit for the mail to be sent to me as the only person who is watching the topic that did not get the notification of the previous update (since it does not send notification to the poster that caused the need for the email in the first place). So every new post to the thread that is being watched will take a bit to post, but other posts by the same person to the thread will not take any time. And posts to threads that are not being &quot;watched&quot; will submit quickly.<br /><br />Seems logical. At least something seriously worthy of looking into.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">After looking at the mail server, it had the same internal dns server in its resolv.conf. It's now using my Winblows DNS server, which was supposed to be replaced by now. Anyway, hammer away as we try to reach 20,000 testing things out.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Based on the fact that you have posted, I should be able to post and get the hypothetical situation that I mentioned earlier. We shall see how long it takes.<br /><br /><b>Edit</b><br />9 seconds. Acceptable. I expect this edit to take between 2 and 5 seconds. I will post back if it takes longer, otherwise assume that was it.<br /><br />Good work.</div>
