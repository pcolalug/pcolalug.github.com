					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello, realized I hadn't introduced myself yet.<br /><br />My name is Michael Greb and I've been using linux for over 10 years. &nbsp;I started in late 93 when the kernel was still pre 1.0, 0.97 if I remember correctly, running Slackware Linux.<br /><br />Today I run Ubuntu hoary on a dual head desktop and a ppc iBook. &nbsp;In addition, I run Debian sid on my Xbox, which functions as a MythTV frontend, and a colocated server hosting my personal website, email, and a few websites for bussinesses and friends.<br /><br />I'm fairly active in the open source community with contributed code in MythTV, the xbox-linux project's kernel, and hopefully soon Asterisk. &nbsp;I am a contributing member to Software in the Public Interest, the legal parent of Debian, and have been staff for the Open and Free Technology Community for a bit over a year now.<br /><br />I work for Linode.com (http://www.linode.com/), a User-Mode-Linux based virtual hosting provider. &nbsp;There I respond to customer trouble tickets, admin 44 co-located servers, write admin automation and business process software for handling day-to-day business and occasionaly preform forensic analysis of rooted customer's machines.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Cool! So you work remotely, w. the HQ in Nashvegas, eh? Very neat!<br /><br />I used to work for an ISP/Hosting Provider called Atlantic.Net back in G'ville. Sales side, but most of my friends were in the NOC. &nbsp;They have their own datacenter down in O'Town, so I'd run back 'n forth a couple of times a month.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />microserf</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Nice to see new blood in the family. &nbsp;I have to say, pcola seems to have a growing linux community. &nbsp;<br /><br />I followed the xbox-linux project religously for about a year after I heard about it, until I fried the TSOP jumpers in a freak soldering accident...that put an end to any hope of &nbsp;'installing' linux on it. &nbsp;<br /><br />Oh well. &nbsp;Needless to say I'll be waiting until the xbox 2 can be 'pre-modded' before purchasing one. &nbsp;I have twitchy fingers ...bad for soldering points the size of sand grains.</div>
