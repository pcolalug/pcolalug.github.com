					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey had a moment thought I would relate my experience helping my friend buy a new laptop.<br />We had traveled to Circuit City, Best Buy and finally to Sam&#039;s Club.....Yea you heard me I would have never guesed that one.<br />We looked @ sony....way over priced but by far the slimest design, gateway which has a 64bit, HP which has some nice lappy&#039;s since last time I looked.<br />He translates 2 dimensional house drawings to cad flat files for the people to print out. And going to a job in Montana where he is taking over a cad design job.<br />So his primary concerns were speed and desktop realestate. After 3 hours of shopping He finally settled on an HP from &quot;Sam&#039;s Club&quot;<br />It is a 3gighz P4,2 gig ddr dual channel ram, 100 gig hd 4200rpm *note most laptop&#039;s only have a 4800rpm hd some like tecra and toshiba have 5400 rpm the only company we found with 7200 rpm were Dell.,6-1 smart media reader, dual layer dvd r/w/cd r/w combo, 17 screen, built in 54g all the standard bells and whistles.<br />for a measly $1700.00 with warranty......<br /><br />Well I have been playing with it and it seem real nice a little hefty at 9.6 lbs.<br />I also had him buy a shiny new superG wireless router for us to play with since he now has a laptop :)<br /><br />Brett</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here (http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.asp?Manufactory=&amp;PropertyCodeValue=0&amp;PropertyCodeValue=0&amp;PropertyCodeValue=355%3A7776&amp;PropertyCodeValue=0&amp;PropertyCodeValue=0&amp;description=&amp;MinPrice=&amp;MaxPrice=&amp;SubCategory=380&amp;Submit=Property) is a listing on Newegg for 7200 rpm drives for laptops. I put one in my 3.06Ghz P4 laptop and it made all the difference in the world. It&#039;s amazing what a $150 investment will make on the performance of a system. Also, once he replaces the hard drive, he can sell off the old one on ebay and recoup some of the cost for the new drive.</div>
