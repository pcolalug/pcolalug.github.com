					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey all,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyone interested in a LAN party? &nbsp;Maybe sometime in the next few weeks? &nbsp;I've got a working RTCW server, and could probably get a Q3A one going too. &nbsp;Also have UT2k3, but not so sure about how to make a server on that. &nbsp;<br /><br />Don't think I could host it myself, but perhaps someone can? &nbsp;Let me know what you think...<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sorry about not posting back... been busy with out of town trips and finals, and re-wiring electrical, network, etc. etc, etc, etc,.....<br /><br />But to answer the question, YES - I'll host the lan party. Unless anybody objects, I say let's do it May 24 (a Saturday) We can do like we did the last time, BYO? and order pizza's. Those that want to help in the setup department be at the house at 3pm. Starting at 4pm I'd like to have an &quot;installfest&quot; for those needing help setting up UT2003, linux, etc. Let the games begin at 5pm<br /><br />Location Information: 8221 Excelsior Dr.<br />Directions: Excelsior is off Olive Rd. between 9th ave. and Davis Hwy. <br /><br />If you get lost, who do you call? &nbsp;476-5631 (Inoch, Inc.)<br /><br />How can you help? &nbsp;Folding tables are always needed for rig's and food.<br /><br />What do you need? &nbsp;You computer, monitor, cords, and at least a 6' patch cable.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">As an afterthough, just so I can plan for spacing requirements, please email me at jjarrell@inoch.com to let me know who's going to show up. It would be nice to have 20 rigs going this time around, so if they have a rig, invite them over.<br /><br />Also, on the list of items needed, an extra network switch or two could be helpful. I have 22 10baseT ports and 8 100baseT ports open, but I'd like them all to be at 100 to be fair.<br /><br />For those that can not join in person, all of the game servers will be available on the default ports at 68.99.60.104 (inoch.com)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">OK, here is my newbie question. &nbsp;One of the posts said that those who can't come &quot;in person&quot; could access through a port.....I was under the impression that a &quot;LAN&quot; party implied you had to be there (local area network). &nbsp;If not, that is great! &nbsp;I will try to log in, from Idaho. &nbsp;Is RTCW on the list for gaming? &nbsp;At least there I will not be a newbie....GRIN</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">RTCW is on the list of games to be played. About the internet access port, rburt & I operate a computer services company, and our internet pipe<br />--<b>just so happens</b>-- to be at the same location as the lan party. So to be nice to those who can't make the road trip (we have SEVERAL out of town users on this lug). I'll post more information as we get closer to the date.</div>

Also, since these games do require some horsepower, how about sugguestions for a low-end game or two that folks can play.

Last time, Jesse set up a projector and played DVD's on a big screen while the gaming went on and the same set-up could be used for the presentaion.<br /><br />Sure would be cool to have something like this once a quarter or so where we throw down for a few hours with rigs, games, pizza, and the like.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">OK, sounds like May 24 is the day. &nbsp;What time will the party kick off??<br /><br />I currently have a RTCW server that runs under Windows. &nbsp;I plan to change it to a Linux server before the 24th.<br /><br />Since I am in Idaho, I will try to join the LAN party via the IP given earlier (how you do that is a mystery to me.....since RTCW requires that you stipulate if you are on the net or a LAN). &nbsp;What port number will you have open?<br /><br />Anyway, I will have the Linux (Mandrake) RTCW server up and running (if I can) by then in case you all want to use it for the fun of it. &nbsp;Server name is &quot;Normandy Beach II&quot;, and I will supply the IP and port number to you for the gathering. &nbsp;I have a 1/2 T1 cable line, so should be smooth. &nbsp;I can password the game so that we don't have to deal with the &quot;punks&quot; out there. &nbsp;BTW, punkbuster will also be running on it, since I plan to use it for the rest of the world after I get it going. &nbsp;Big Brother Dan, I will be calling you to help me get it all up and running!!! &nbsp;Just as I feared, I am sliding down the slippery slope to Linux.....<br /><br />Mark</div>

If we had planned this a month or so in advance, then that would be different, but I think it is just too close to scrap the normal meeting night altogether.<br /><br />Either way, I will not be here for the 17, but should be part of the festivities on the 24th.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok, the games so far are:<br /><br />UT2k3 (possible using their counter-strike alike - I'll track this down)<br />RTcW - Enemy Territory (really excited about this one!)<br />Q3A<br /><br />I'll post the announcement this evening with a list of games and point folks here so they can make game requests. Friday, if we have more than 3 or 4 games, I'll post a poll that'll run 'till the following Thursday (give us time to set up dedicated servers) and we'll run the top 4 winners. This will, in no way, prevent folks from bringing a game they like and hosting a game on their machine for interested parties. Let me know what you think of the plan.<br /><br />I'd also like the folks to check out the offerings from GarageGames (http://www.garagegames.com). Most run on Linux, have free demos and some sort of LAN play. They are a bit of a departure from the standard run and gun, and I thought it'd be a nice change of pace for some.<br /><br />In case you haven't heard of GG, this is a company started by a couple of ex-Dynamix folks. They continue the development of the Torque engine that powered Tribes 2. They sell this very capable engine at $100 a developer (*mega* cheap for a commercial game engine) and have built a community of independent and hobbiest game makers. Lots of tips, code, and other support for the budding hacker hoping to start the next Id to the geek just messing around late at night. Also, should your game, once completed, show promise, GG will partner with you as publisher to help you get your game to the masses. Lots of neat (and not-so-neat) projects going on over there. Take some time and browse around the &quot;Make Games&quot; section if you have a few.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">UT's CS-alike is called Tactics, and is in the process of being ported to 2k3 (its a mod for the original). It sounds good, though. I'll make it part of the poll this Friday.<br /><br />Anybody know anything about the Linux version of the original UT? I'm sure one could pick up a copy on the net for cheap.</div>

I guess we'll wait and hope they have Tactics ported by the next party.<br /><br />As an aside, wonder why they chose Glide of all things.

I remember it. It was great. *shrug* Oh yeah, and the significant part is that I have a Riva TNT2 meaning not glide.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think the table situation is under control. We currently have 18' of table for gaming rigs, and if needed the dining room table can be used as well. <br /><br />As far as the head count, only 1 email came in letting me know they were going to make it, but I suspect that the turnout will be MUCH larger than that. I'm expecting a minimum of 10+ rigs, but we'll see how it goes.<br /><br />The gaming room has been set up. Power, network and tables have been setup almost like before, except this time the tables are in the center of the room so we can use both sides of the table. For the swap meet, I will have tables with power and network available for testing out the great finds that will be there.<br /><br />I don't know about everyone else, but I'm looking forward to tomorrow!!!<br /><br />Jesse</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Our requirements, loose as they are, are only that a native Linux binary be (legally) atainable. If the game in question has a Windows version, you are more than welcome to game on the platform of your choice.<br /><br />The Pcola LUG does <b>not</b> descriminate against platforms. As Linux users, we kinda know what that is like and should not push any platform bias on anyone. Pcola LUG will not endorse nor espouse, in any official capacity, &quot;bashing&quot; of one platform over another. Debates on technical merits are fine, but bigotry is frowned upon.<br /><br />You make the technology choices that are best for you. We only insist on the above guideline so that those of us who have &quot;taken the plunge&quot; and gone OSS-only can play. Also, as an OSS advocacy group, this shows support for the companies that make cross-platform games.<br /><br />Ok, now that I've said all that, I await the OSX users with asbestos long johns. ;)</div>

Distributions are sort of like butt holes, everyone has a favorite...wait that didn't come out right. Anyway, everyone has a favorite and the only way to find out which one you like the best is by using one. No, you don't have to take the plunge and run it all the time, but if you are interested in learning about linux or any of the other unix work alikes, pick one and get it installed. I found that I learned best by having a particular goal in mind. You first goal should be to get a fully functional system up. In doing that, you will find other goals...well, hopefully.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: Starraisin</div><div class="quote">I don't think matters what OS as long as there is a client for it.</div><br /><br />Think of the game clients as just that clients. The server and the client don't have to have the same underlying OS. Think of a web client or browser and a web server. The majority of the webservers out there on the net are running some form of Apache on some form of unix or unix work alike and the majority of the browsers run on some other OS. There is an underlying protocol that the two talk to each other and that is what matters. When we say we only look for at least some version that is native to linux, we want there to at least be a client available that has been compiled to run in linux. I don't know a single instance that a game will not interact with itself because one of the players is using linux and the other is using windows as long as the two are of the same version.</div>
