					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Wanted to try something new today so I downloaded and installed the latest version of Kubuntu. &nbsp;It's very much cleaned up and easy to use - but I still can't get comfortable in it. &nbsp;Been using Gnome too long maybe. &nbsp;But this is much nicer than last time I tried anything KDE related. &nbsp;<br /><br />Once nice feature I spotted (don't know if this is from KDE or a Ubuntu add-on), there's a &quot;Swich User&quot; sub-menu in the Application (K) menu. &nbsp;Let's you switch between logged-in user session (text console or X based). &nbsp;Very handy. &nbsp;Haven't tried it, but if it lets you get back to the login screen and start another session while a user's X console is locked that would be really nice.<br /><br />Any of you KDE guys that haven't tried it might want to give kubuntu a try.<br /><br />This version of Konqueror (3.4) has a seperate address bar and search bar just like FireFox. &nbsp;(Not sure how long it's had that feature, but last time I used KDE all you got was the location bar). &nbsp;<br /><br />Drive mounting seems to work . I was able to auto-mount USB and FireWire devices. &nbsp;However, inserting a CD didn't give me any CD icons on my desktop, so I guess those don't auto-mount. &nbsp;(Update: Doesn't show up on the desktop with other drive icons, but it does mount - just have to go to My Computer -&gt; Media to notice it).<br /><br />Fonts are ugly just like in Ubuntu Gnome, if anyone has a definitive fix on these let me know. &nbsp;I can tweak them to a point they're OK under gnome but not sure how to do the same under KDE. &nbsp;<br /><br />Also under Gnome, OpenOffice integrates nicely with the ooo-gnome package, but the ooo-kde package doesn't seem to do anything for me? &nbsp;(The theme doesn't match the rest of the system, it doesn't use KDE's file open/save dialogs, etc.)<br /><br />The synaptic package manager in Gnome seems to be nicer to use than the Kynaptic one under KDE. &nbsp;At least seems to have more features implemented. &nbsp;<br /><br />I may be alone in this - but I don't like Tabbed windows. &nbsp;This especially got to me in Konqueror, I was working on a web page, then click on My Computer to access a drive, and it opened the folder up in a seperate Tab in my web browser. &nbsp;That's kinda confusing. &nbsp;Really hope they eventually get a clean seperation of Web / File browsing.<br /><br />Overall seems pretty good though.<br /><br />Nick</div>
