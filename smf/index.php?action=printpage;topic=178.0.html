					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I downloaded RedHat 8.0 (psyche) last night and got it installed this morning. &nbsp;It's 5 cd's (although my default workstation install only used the first two).<br /><br />I must say, RedHat has taken GNOME to the next level. &nbsp;This is nice. &nbsp;Gone are the days of 5 different printer configuration programs and cumbersome menus. &nbsp;This bad-boy is streamlined. &nbsp;And works great!<br /><br />Installation was a breeze, all hardware was detected perfectly. &nbsp;I chose to do a default workstation install (which gives you Gnome, Evolution, Open Office, Mozilla, games, development tools, configuration utilities).<br /><br />I ran into a problem when I first tried to login to my system, it would display the Gnome logo and lockup. &nbsp;I'm not sure what the problem was, but I went to the console, installed my latest NVidia drivers and it still locked up. &nbsp;So this time before I hit &quot;ENTER&quot; on my password I manually selected &quot;American English&quot; and &quot;Gnome&quot; from the options, then logged in, and it worked fine. &nbsp;<br /><br />So far I'm very impressed with this system. &nbsp;The custom fonts provided by redhat give gnome a more pollished and professional look. &nbsp;Much better (IMHO) than KDE on Mandrake. &nbsp;Also Mozilla is working beautifully, no crashes, no mis-rendered pages.<br /><br />I wanted to grab a screenshot to show everyone but GIMP is having trouble doing a screen-cap, so I'm gonna install another utility. &nbsp;I'll post it here once I have it.<br /><br />I've gotta say, RedHat 8 is definitely my new distro of choice. &nbsp;Give it a try, I'm sure you'll like it.<br /><br />Nick<br />imnes@go.com</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Screenshot looks good. I guess you got GIMP to do the capture? I noticed that was the graphics program that was open.<br /><br />I like the hat menu. One of the things I do not like with KDE is the organization (or lack thereof) of the K menu. Is this typical of Gnome, or has RH changed it quite a bit?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well RedHat has obviously customized it a bit, but generally the menu has always been fairly well organized. &nbsp;But it was definitely cleaned up and fine-tuned for this release.<br /><br />I was trying to show off one aspect in the screenshot. &nbsp;They've trimmed out all the extraneous programs. &nbsp;The internet menu used to consist of Mozilla, Netscape 6, Netscape 4, Kate, Licq, Gaim, kirc, and a bunch of other programs. &nbsp;Now they've gone back to basics, they give you one web browser (mozilla), one chat program (gaim), and one email program (evolution).<br /><br />This is all in gnome's push to create a more user-friendly desktop. &nbsp;That's one thing that makes windows easy for beginners, you want to go online you click on internet explorer, want to edit a document, click on Word. &nbsp;OpenOffice has been integrated now as gnome's official office suite, evolution (which is an excellent personal management / email tool) is part of the official packages, and with some big-name backers adopting it like Sun Microsystems, Gnome is well on it's way. &nbsp;<br /><br />Kind of the opposite of my experiences with KDE lately. &nbsp;I don't know if they're pushing ahead with version releases too fast or what, but I've had serious stability problems with KDE3 and konqueror in particular. &nbsp;In fact, yesterday my entire mandrake system took a nose &nbsp;dive (prompting me to download and install RedHat). &nbsp;Here's a screenshot of what I found last time I booted my mandrake machine. &nbsp;My programs were gone from the menu system, and all my quick launch icons werer now corrupt.<br /><br />http://homeweb.org/~imnes/nokde.png<br /><br />Interesting problem, I have no idea what happened.<br /><br />And as far as GIMP, it finally let me grab screenshots. &nbsp;It would give me an error to the effect of &quot;____ is not a valid file&quot; or something like that. &nbsp;<br /><br />I probably won't get a chance to fully test it out since I've got a busy week coming up and I have parts to upgrade my computer on the way, so I plan to reload windows and linux partitions next weekend. &nbsp;I'll keep you up to date on what I find out.<br /><br />Nick<br />imnes@go.com</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am in agreement on Gnome's quest to clean things up a bit. KDE (and the typical Linux distro) should do the same. I love the fact that I have several good browsers available to me (lynx, Mozilla, Netscape, Galeon, Konquerer, etc., ad nauseum). But I do not like having them all loaded by default.<br /><br />The GUI should have it's own default browser. Don't add all the others. The Distro should have their default as well. If they don't like Konquerer, then put in Mozilla (or whatever). All of them should be available to me on the Distro CD though. Or, if I am intelligent enough to know that I don't like the browser they give me, then I should be able to go to the internet and get my favorite.<br /><br />That should be done with every software package, not just browsers. <br /><br />For example. If KDE wants to push their KOffice (why? I am not sure), then they should load that in their package. If my distro of choice is Mandrake and they like OpenOffice.org, then they should by default, pull out KOffice and stick in OpenOffice.org. If I don't like it, I can then change it without having to have 4 office suites loaded.<br /><br />I am not for &quot;dumbing down&quot; Linux for users. But I am all for simplifying and making it useable. <br /><br />I applaud Red Had/Gnome for that. I don't like either, but my hat goes off to them for thier efforts.<br /><br />I have been imressed with what I have read about Lindows (http://www.lindows.com). They have sought to simplify. Everything that is available to any Linux distro is avialable there, just not all crammed down your throat on a default install.<br /><br />Just my $0.02.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That seems to be the idea with RedHat's latest effort. &nbsp;I did a fairly minimal install. &nbsp;Barely installed software off 2 of the 5 cd's you get. &nbsp;So there are literally thousands of packages you can go through and add as you like.<br /><br />I read through the Lindows articles posted on another forum. &nbsp;Looks very nice, but I have to agree with the author. &nbsp;It's time for some of the linux folks to quit writing so many competing applications and focus on creating the best User Interface available. &nbsp;Apple took a big chance with OS/X but it paid off (I really like the look, but I could see getting tired off it after looking at it every day). &nbsp;<br /><br />Some cohersion needs to happen in the Open Source world. &nbsp;KDE and GNOME are each killer desktops in their own right, but just imagine what would be available if all the coders put that effort into one single desktop. &nbsp;Same for other apps, there are like 20 different Instant Messangers available. &nbsp;GAIM has by far pulled ahead, has tons of features, and works great. &nbsp; The other projects are just to amuse the few people who use them I guess. &nbsp;<br /><br />A lot of people are completely against the idea of combining the efforts of gnome / kde into one project. &nbsp;Well in that case I would say let them keep developing independent desktops, but have the same compatibilities at the core. &nbsp;Same configuration files, same menu layouts, (SAME SOUND SERVER!!!). &nbsp;That way even if you're running KDE, your GNOME apps will still function perfectly.<br /><br />And on the issue of sound servers, some of my programs expect to see ArtsD, some expect to see ESD, and others want direct access to the sound card (requiring me to kill off the sound servers all together). &nbsp;Why doesn't linux push the sound server to a lower level than the window manager, so your window manager's programs, and any console programs all go through a system level sound server? &nbsp;Seems the logical (and best) solution to me.<br /><br />Maybe someone can offer some input into this. &nbsp;As far as I can tell (from what I've used) open office is the best office suite available for linux. &nbsp;I tried KOffice but didn't really feel comfortable using it, AbiWord is kinda limited in it's capabilities. &nbsp;That's another area where developers of other less capable products could abandon their current efforts and concentrate on making the best programs even better.<br /><br />Back on the Lindows issue. &nbsp;I like what I saw in the review, but I'm not about to pay for a linux distro. &nbsp;Sorry, starving student budget here. &nbsp;Why don't they have a free version available like most everyone else has? &nbsp;Give away the OS but charge your subscription (maybe $25 a year, not $125 or $99 or whatever) for the software installer (click & run or whatever it was called).<br /><br />--<br /><br />Another issue. &nbsp;Microsoft clearly has some good (albeit bloated) programs. &nbsp;Internet Explorer does a great job, as does Microsoft Office. &nbsp;The programs have been ported to Mac and Mac OSX. &nbsp;Even Internet Explorer and Media Player have been ported to Unix (Sparc I beleive). &nbsp;Would be even easier to release x86 linux ports. &nbsp;From what I undesrstand, Microsoft's flagship money-maker is the office suite. &nbsp;Why not port it to linux and gain that platform as well? &nbsp;It can't be because they don't want people to consider switching from windows, they offer it on Mac. &nbsp;Oh well, just a thought.<br /><br />--<br /><br />And how about the slashdot report a month or so ago about the Intel build of Mac OS/X? &nbsp;I'd be interested to see that surface.<br /><br />Nick<br />imnes@go.com</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I agree with imnes about the compatability of the two desktops. I am all for two different environments. But why not share resources so that an app that works in one GUI can work in the other (without having to load half of the code from the other environment to make it work)?<br /><br />I don't use GAIM (or any product of the sort), but if what you (imnes) say is true, that there is a clear leader, then I agree with you that we should focus our efforts. But in the case of KDE / Gnome, I don't think there is a clear leader. One may have the majority of market share, but there are staunch advocates on both sides. My prophecy, &quot;I don't believe we will ever see a merging of the two desktop environments.&quot; That is not to say that I don't think that they will become more compatible.<br /><br />Sound server gut level? Doesn't sound like a security issue to me. I am for it. Now we just have to have someone implement it and submit it to the GUI developers. Of course there is a reason they use the one they use. For whatever reason, they do not feel that the other fits their purposes.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">As far as I can tell (from what I've used) open office is the best office suite available for linux. </div><br />I think it is the best office suite (though a little immature) for Windows as well. It is not as full featured as MS Office. But Microsoft has been working on Office for at least 8 years now. OOo is a new kid on the block. I know it is from StarOffice, which has been around a while. But now that it is in the open source community, I think we will see some quick improvements.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It just seems like a wasted effort for the Gnome and KDE projects to continue in parallel. &nbsp;To me it looks like they're both working hard to incorporate the same features into their own product.<br /><br />Things are a lot better now than they used to be. &nbsp;I remember up until a few short years ago that something as trivial as copy->pasting between applications in X was a nitemare. &nbsp;<br /><br />I guess part of my frustration is that XWindows is sort of old technology, and was missing a lot of core functionality that you needed on the desktop (like sound servers, a shared clipboard for copy->pasting, a good general file manager), and each of the larger Window Managers (Gnome/KDE) implemented them in their own way. &nbsp;I agree that we probably will not see the merging of the two, since each (in my view anyway) have probably equal share on the linux desktops. &nbsp;<br /><br />Ultimately I'd like it see the window manager code abstraced from the system code. &nbsp;Someone mentioned it above. &nbsp;That way if you want to code in the KDE/QT style that's fine, and if you code in Gnome/GTK that's fine, but under the hood the library calls would be converted to some more generic library that handles actually calling the x server and performing functions.<br /><br />I don't know if anyone else has noticed, but if you are in gnome and want to start a KDE application, you've got a substantial wait ahead of you. &nbsp;While the DCOP server, ArtS server, and other desktop components fire up before the application can start. &nbsp;I assume it is similar trying to start a large Gnome app from within KDE (though I haven't tried, so I'm not positive on that).<br /><br />I thought I might step on some toes with this subject, but at least we're generating some interesting discussions :-D<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Might I suggest that some of the mandrake users give Redhat a try? &nbsp;You might be pleasantly surprised. &nbsp;If anyone's interested I can burn a set of CD's and pass around for you guys to try out.<br /><br />That's another idea, I always have the latest version of several distributions downloaded, if you want I can make a point to keep a few copies in the &quot;library&quot; to save some of you with slower connections the trouble of downloading. &nbsp;<br /><br />Let me know<br /><br />Nick</div>

I was getting ready to upgrade to 9.0, but Steve's post about USB support (http://pcolalug.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=165) scares me. I will try the RH that you have to offer and let you know if I become a believer. Of course then we would have to change my vote in your poll.<br /><br />When and where can you meet to give me the distro?<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay, the side-by-side comparison is a little scary. &nbsp;RedHat has customized KDE and GNOME to the point they look way-too-similar. &nbsp;Have a look.<br /><br />They even took out the standard KDE apps and replaced them with GNOME apps. &nbsp;Instead of KOffice you get OpenOffice. &nbsp;Instead of KMediaPlayer, you get XMMS. &nbsp;And Konqueror isn't even in the menus, you get mozilla. &nbsp;(I fired up Konqueror via the Run dialog).<br /><br />I guess this is great for the average user who doesn't know / care what Gnome / KDE are and just needs to be able to know how to get around and use it. &nbsp;No matter which windowmanager they pick, menus are layed out identically. &nbsp;And without having the actual program names in the menus, it's easier to &quot;figure out&quot; how to use it. &nbsp;Instead of clicking on &quot;Konqueror&quot; or &quot;Mozilla&quot;, you click on &quot;Internet->WebBrowser&quot;. &nbsp;I like that.<br /><br />GNOME 2<br />http://homeweb.org/~imnes/rh8_ss1.png<br /><br />KDE 3<br />http://homeweb.org/~imnes/rh8kde.png</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Lycoris (http://www.lycoris.com) does something similar and has a really good menu layout for newbs. &nbsp;I gotta say that that theme is sharp too. Is that the new blue-whatever theme? I really don't see why the KDE (http://www.kde.org) folks were all a fluster over this. It is open source after all and you should expect folks to muck with your stuff. &nbsp;That *is* the point, isn't it?</div>
