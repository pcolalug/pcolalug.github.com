					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome back. It has been a while since we have seen you in.<br /><br />If any other night of the week works for you, lloydr and I have been playing at 69.44.152.106 quite a bit lately. Anyone is welcome to join us as it is a public server. Sometimes it is hard to get in though. They have a TeamSpeak server as well. I don't want to pull anyone away from playing on our server, but we really have not been announcing it lately and I am not sure the server stays up all the time.<br /><br />The server that we have been playing on is FiremanET. Their website (http://www.firemanet.com) has the server rules and such. They are pretty harsh about kicking people. Just don't be a jerk and they will let you play. They are not elitists either. They will not kick you because you are not a regular, but an intetional TK will have you looking for another server.<br /><br />I am there later than 8:00 in the evenings. Usually closer to 10:00 before I get started. Sometimes I am there in the afternoons. I think lloydr lives there.<br /><br />Again, welcome back and Happy New Year!</div>

A fair amount of them are experienced Linux users so it's easy to get along with em &nbsp;:wink:</div>
