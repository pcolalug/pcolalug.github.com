					Title: <b>Upcoming Gnome Enhancements</b><br />
					Post by: <b>imnes</b> on <b>December 05, 2005, 08:23:50 am</b>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">From this blog entry (http://tieguy.org/blog/index.cgi/516) linked from planet.gnome.org (http://planet.gnome.org).  Some reasons why 2006 will be a good year for Gnome:<br /><br /><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><li>performance: huge amounts of performance work (including involvement from Sun, Novell, Nokia and IBM) going into the core platform, which should make every GNOME app faster and use less memory, and into gnome-session, which should make the overall launch experience faster.</li><li>instant messaging: a revamped gnomemeeting, with simpler UI and support for SIP; and (slightly out of the gnome sphere, but close) GAIM 2.0, with great support for standards (including jabber) and a simplified UI.</li><li>iinterop with the system: with gnome-screensaver and network-manager beginning to be widely deployed and sending out signals over d-bus, lots of apps should get smarter about the state of your computer- if you&#039;re away, gnome-screensaver will say so, and apps like GAIM, gnomemeeting, and xchat-gnome will then indicate you&#039;re away instead of having people communicate and wonder why you aren&#039;t responding. If you&#039;re offline, network-manager will say so, and apps will automatically log off instead of irritating you with &#039;you&#039;re offline. reconnect? [yes|no]&#039; dialogs. Better power management through gnome-power-manager too.</li><li>management for admins: sabayon and pessulus should become polished and widely deployed, making it incredibly easy for even gnome-newbie admins anywhere to configure and lockdown GNOME.</li><li>development platform: Project Ridley (simplifying APIs and moving them into GTK) and the new developer documentation the Foundation has commissioned should make the developer platform much easier and more pleasant to use.</li><li>milestones for related projects: Mono should reach 2.0, marking it as a mature platform for those wishing to use C# to develop for GNOME; gstreamer should reach 0.10, with huge improvements in stability and performance, and hopefully in support for more difficult codecs. Both of these should help GNOME become more widespread.</li><li>organization: the Board will be smaller and hopefully more active; GUADEC will have the most days (certainly) and be the best attended (hopefully) of any event we&#039;ve ever had.</li><li>quality: in the past 365 days we&#039;ve fixed 9538 bugs (as of Nov. 7th 8:47am EST) Projects are underway to improve our crash reporting and seriously upgrade our bug tracking system, and for the first time in the Linux desktop space, we have not one but two automated testing platforms now- LDTP and Dogtail. I expect in the next year one will become widely deployed, and lots of tests will be written, making GNOME the first free software GUI tool with widespread pre-release automated testing. So I expect we&#039;ll fix substantially more bugs next year.</li></ul></div>
