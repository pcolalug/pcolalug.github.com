					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hopefully I don't offend anyone with this. &nbsp;If you're under 18 or offended by 'adult-oriented material', go back now.<br /><br /><br /><br />You still here, you must wanna see.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I came across this novelty while looking for ascii art. &nbsp;Some of us were talking about the software that allows you to render gfx / video in ascii. &nbsp;Well here's the best example I've ever seen.<br /><br />Keep the kids away though. &nbsp;This is a &quot;historical rendering of the classic adult film Deep Throat.&quot; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;http://www1.zkm.de/~wvdc/ascii/java/<br /><br />Those of you interested take a look. &nbsp;We can delete this post if you guys want, I just thought it was funny enough to pass along.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hmmm.... &nbsp;doesn't seem to work here (using IE). &nbsp;I get a new window, and a bunch of green ascii characters juggling around, but no image that I can recognize. &nbsp;Is something not set up correctly on my end...?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think I saw it. I am running Mozilla in Mandrake. I had to shut one eye, squint, stand on my head, and spin around. But, I'm pretty sure I saw something.<br /><br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think you guys got it. &nbsp;Not easy to make out. &nbsp;It's rendered very low-res in ascii, maybe 80x25 or something. &nbsp;Stand like 20 &nbsp;feet from your monitor and it might work better.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Technically intruiging, however, the ascii renderer does keep the film from having its original effect...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">OK, standing back a ways does help. &nbsp;I was able to make out a car driving along, and a steering wheel after that. &nbsp;At about that point, the blood vessels in my eyes started to burst, and I had to quit. &nbsp;<br /><br />Can you go blind from that stuff...? &nbsp; &nbsp;:shock:</div>
