					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just want to introduce myself.<br /><br />My name is Peter Hedeen and I am a Medical Technologist (working night shift in the lab at Gulf Breeze Hospital).<br /><br />I am a total newbie to Linux and am in the process of reading online Linux tutorials to become familiar with it. &nbsp;I am a big fan of open source software and would love to end my dependance on M$ stuff. &nbsp;Linux seems to be the answer I have been looking for. &nbsp;It is wonderful that there is this users group here in Pensacola. &nbsp;Everyone seems very nice from what I have read so far in the discussion boards.<br /><br />Santa and my wife got together and decided to authorize a new system for me :D ! &nbsp;I will be running an Athalon 2400 with 512MB and 2 60GB hard drives. &nbsp;I understand Linux and Windows XP do not play well together on the same HD so each will be on its own HD. &nbsp;I would like to set up the system to be able to boot up into either Linux or Windows XP.<br /><br />From what I've read on these discussion boards, the favorite distro seems to be Mandrake 9.0. &nbsp;I had ordered the Debian GNU/Linux distro CD's which I guess was clueless newbie mistake #1. &nbsp;I see where Mandrake has an &quot;Operating system refugee&quot; program where you can order 9.0 for $12.50. &nbsp;Being a first timer, is it better to order their CD's or download the ISO's from their website? &nbsp;I do have broadband net access (cox.net) so downloading large files will not be a major problem. &nbsp;I am looking for any way to minimize problems on install.<br /><br />My current plans are just to be a Linux desktop user (for now). &nbsp;KDE looks pretty nice and hopefully will not be to difficult to get used to. &nbsp;<br /><br />Any suggestions from all of you would be most welcome. &nbsp;I'd like to hear from folks who have, &quot;been there and done that&quot; and have the benefit of your experience.<br /><br />As I said before, I am looking to eventually move away from M$. &nbsp;I like the open source philosophy and especially the price! &nbsp;I currently use OpenOffice.org 1.0.1 under Windows XP. &nbsp;Also I just don't like the newer M$ products and O/S's that, while convenient, &nbsp;have my computer doing things not only without my permission but also without my knowledge.<br /><br />Computers have been a longstanding interest and hobby of mine. &nbsp;I started out in 1983 with a KayPro II. &nbsp;What interests me about Linux is that it can be configured to each users personal preference. &nbsp;Looks like you can choose from anything between and command line and a GUI. &nbsp;I enjoy tweaking and fiddling with my system and Linux seems tailor made for that.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to meeting some or all of you ant your next meeting and want to express in advance my gratitude for all the help and advice I'm sure will be forthcoming.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: phed</div><div class="quote">I understand Linux and Windows XP do not play well together on the same HD so each will be on its own HD. </div><br />I have run Linux and XP on the same drive without problems. I have had best results when I installed the Windows first and then Linux. You have to realize that Linux will not be able to write to your NTFS (the file system that XP runs on). <br /><br />If you want to trade files between the two OSes, then you will need to set up another partition that is just a FAT or FAT32 partition. This will be viewable and writeable from both OSes. The other option is to install XP on a FAT32 partition. I will assume that it is already installed and working, so there is no sense in monkeying with it. Just set up another partition (FAT32) that will be viewable and writeable from both. Either way, you will be able to see your XP partition from Linux. It is completely readable, you just cannot write to it.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: phed</div><div class="quote">I had ordered the Debian GNU/Linux distro CD's which I guess was clueless newbie mistake #1. </div><br />Not a mistake. If you are anything like the rest of us, you will want to try them all (or at least a good handful) before you decide on the one that you will stick with the rest of your life, or the next 3 weeks when a newer one hits the servers.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: phed</div><div class="quote"> Being a first timer, is it better to order their CD's or download the ISO's from their website?</div><br />Apparently, Mandrake is hard up for cash. So go ahead and send them the 12 and 1/2 bucks. They need all the help they can get.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: phed</div><div class="quote">As I said before, I am looking to eventually move away from M$. </div><br />Don't get your hopes up too high. I have been trying to do the same thing for 4 or so years. The problem is games. You need a small Windows partition just so you can have the game fix.<br /><br />One thing that has helped me with a transition is to use programs in Windows that you will use in Linux. For example, I run OpenOffice.org for both Linux and Windows. This lets me keep the same software and file types in both OSes. I use Mozilla/Phoenix as my browser in both places as well.<br /><br />As you get into this let us know some specific questions in the appropriate spots. Some guys live to be able to post on this board. <br /><br />Welcome to the team. Look forward to meeting you.<br /><br />David<br />VP, Pcola LUG</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: phed</div><div class="quote">From what I've read on these discussion boards, the favorite distro seems to be Mandrake 9.0. I had ordered the Debian GNU/Linux distro CD's which I guess was clueless newbie mistake #1.</div><br /><br />Hey hey! Don't be thinking that Debian was a mistake. Debian is very popular and if you need any help at all with it, I'll be more than happy to help you. I am a huge Debian fan, but I will say it isn't the best desktop Linux solution. Also, you can get on IRC and any EFNET server and go into #Linux. There are quite a few Deb fans in there. That was my old hang out and there are some great folks in there who will be very willing to offer up some help. Just remember that you have several sources of great info in google (including groups.google.com), man pages, www.tldp.org which has a whole library of HOWTOs and such as well as the documentation that comes with your packages. If you can't figure something out after that, no one will ever fault you for not understanding something. It is an aquired art to read manpages and HOWTOs. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: phed</div><div class="quote">I see where Mandrake has an &quot;Operating system refugee&quot; program where you can order 9.0 for $12.50. Being a first timer, is it better to order their CD's or download the ISO's from their website? I do have broadband net access (cox.net) so downloading large files will not be a major problem. I am looking for any way to minimize problems on install. </div><br /><br />Two things on this. The $12.50 offer is for a full set of Mandrake 8.1 or 8.2 or a /single/ cd edition of Mandrake 9.0. This won't give you a whole lot of software, but nothing is stopping you from downloading the packages or the other two cds from a mirror. You can also looking into Redhat. It is supposed to be pretty darn nice as well. At the present moment, I am using Mandrake 9.0 and am pretty happy, but I do miss apt (part of debian). <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: phed</div><div class="quote">KDE looks pretty nice and hopefully will not be to difficult to get used to. </div><br /><br />It is geared for easy migration from a Windows environment. The general use is very similar to the windows start menu idea. You won't have issues there. When you start digging deeper, which you will, you will find the differences and you can always ask any questions you have here. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: phed</div><div class="quote">Any suggestions from all of you would be most welcome. I'd like to hear from folks who have, &quot;been there and done that&quot; and have the benefit of your experience.</div><br /><br />My biggest suggestion for anyone is once you get used to the general GUI desktop, dive into the command line. The true power of Linux (and any other Un*x based OS) is the command line. Learn how to read manpages and get comfortable with config files. You will be a better person for it...or something like that. I've got a friend who is learning command line right now. It goes quickly and is very rewarding, especially when you write your first shell script. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: phed</div><div class="quote">I like the open source philosophy and especially the price! </div><br /><br />For the most part, most of the leaders of the OSS movement (besides the highly religious) want OSS to be used because it is the best tool for the job. Use what makes your life the easiest and makes you happy. Computing should be fun and Linux and the rest of the OSS movement has put that fun back into it. <br /><br />I look forward to hearing more from you. Welcome and thanks for getting me one more step away from being FNG on the forum &nbsp;:wink:</div>

The only complaints my wife has is that I change distros every 6 months or so and keep forgetting to back up her address book! :roll: As for gaming, yes, your choices can be limited at times, but its getting better every day! Check out Tux Games (http://www.tuxgames.com) for some commercial titles for Linux (this site is in the UK, so shipping may take a bit longer than you are used to), and the addictiveness of Tux Racer cannot be overstated. My son really enjoys GLTron as well. Right now, NVidia offers the best consumer graphics support for Linux, but ATI has started (slowly) beefing up their Linux support.<br /><br />As for folks &quot;living to post on the forum,&quot; dpeach is just sad because I out-posted him a few months back and he's yet to catch up! :)<br /><br />Finally, welcome to the group! Folks 'round here are eager to help out as well as learn new things in the process. I look forward to meeting you in January.</div>

I have caught up once. <br /><br />Between the two of us, we still hold 50% of all posts on the board. And out of that 100% of mine are useful and intelligent. At least a few of rburt3's have been helpful. So we are an asset to the community.<br /><br />David<br /><br />Also, I post with more than just smilies.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Games. &nbsp;Most of the new popular games are available for Linux, but there's some games I still like to play that aren't (and probably won't be) ported.<br /><br />Duke Nukem 3D<br />Need For Speed 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...<br />Red Faction<br />Hitman <br />GTA 1, 2, 3, Vice<br />and some others...<br /><br />Most of the popular ones, especially anything by ID Software is available. &nbsp;Definitely a lack of a good racing sim. &nbsp;According to the website, there's no plan to have a linux version of Duke Nukem Forever when it's released. &nbsp;So I give 20g to windows for games and the other 40g of my drive are for linux. &nbsp;I don't have a problem dual booting so it works for me.<br /><br />Whenever Wine and DosEmu are perfected I guess this will all be a mute point huh?<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I can appreciate that some of the games are coming out for Linux. But most that are, are the type of game I just don't particulalry like, First Person Shooters.<br /><br />I like some of the sports games and racers. There was one racer that we talked about at one point. I downloaded it and found that I had to be a programmer to figure out how to install the thing. I had to jump through too many hoops to get all the supporting files and programs, it just was not worth the effort to me.<br /><br />Of course, you could always just get you a console platform and play your games there. The only problem with that is the boss may not let you set up a TV and console in the office.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm certainly hoping that Linux gaming becomes more popular. One of my planned purchases for when I get back into the states and my divorce is all settled is to buy a new video card. My Riva TNT2 just doesn't cut it with today's games. <br /><br />With my new found freedom, I'll be able to enjoy some shooty goodness again. I just wish they would port Dark Age of Camelot or one of the new MMORPGs that are scheduled to come out. Maybe it is a good thing that they haven't ported any yet...</div>

Santa brought a PS2 for my son. I went looking for games for it and found that many of the games I want to play (including most, if not all of rm's list) are not only available for the PS2, but things like GTA were console titles first. I also just got back from visiting friends that had an XBox. Ok, I know, I know, is MS, but they lose tons of money on every unit they sell, don't they? Anyway, Project Gotham is one of the most fun racers I've seen since SW Racer. My wife even got into it.<br /><br />So, for Momma Burt's little boy, if the game's available for Linux, I'll get it for Linux (PC's are still better for playing games &lt;duck /&gt;), otherwise its the PlayStation.</div>

There is only so much you can do with a game pad and only so rich an experience you can get from a console...but then there are the games like Steel Battalion (http://www.capcom.com/SB/) which defy this, but also come with their own controller... and what a controller it is. <br /><br />(http://xboxmedia.ign.com/xbox/image/steelbattcontrollein1r.jpg)<br /><br />I personally love my PS2, but I can't wait to get home to get back into MMORPG heaven.

A game for PC has to assume anything from no controller to the best on the market. I do like that you can customize the controller layout on the PC better than a console, but that can also cause problems when you go to someone elses house to play their game–you either have to learn their layout, or reconfigure for yourself.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: rburt3</div><div class="quote">Santa brought a PS2 for my son.</div><br />Sure it was for your son!<br /><br />David</div>
