					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey everyone,<br /><br />SSI is swapping out T1&#039;s today or tonight, depending on when I get done with new firewall rules. DNS for ssifla.com and email is being swapped as it is, and then swapping T1 lines to megapath, and then once I am done I will be working on the lug DNS, but just a warning the site may be out for a bit later today. Sorry for outage but the work domain takes first priority in the swapping, lug domain once that is all done.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">sorry everyone, that took longer than I wanted. <br /><br />The CF card and CF/ide converter died in my openbsd firewall at office while doing the change out to the new T1, so I had to scramble. Gotta love it when you change your pf.conf and save it with new IP info, just to watch it crap out. <br /><br />Keeping the office LAN up and browsing with email was priority so I had to revert back to the stock T1 router which wasn&#039;t really capable of routing the /27 subnet. I got the firewall rebuilt and running off a live cd with usb thumbdrive housing the configs for now. Eventually I will rebuild on a CF card again or switch to a soekris with CF card, but this works for now.<br /><br />Sorry for the downtime and all should be up and going finally once the new DNS populates.</div>
