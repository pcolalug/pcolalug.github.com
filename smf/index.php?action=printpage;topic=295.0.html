					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello all! <br /><br />It is nice to know that in LA (Lower Alabama) there are other people interested in the open source movement. I don't live in the Pcola area, but I grew up there and left the area about two years ago. When I come back for a visit, I will be stopping by for a meeting. In the mean time, I hope to throw my two cents in, help those I can and learn at the same time. <br /><br />About my experience, I worked for two years after high school at the Escambia River Electric Cooperative in Jay for their ISP. We ran a number of Linux servers and I can say I learned about half of what I know about computers as a whole there. After moving to Houston in 2001, I continued doing remote admin for them and began running my own server at home. I now do net admin for the AF and got my position of Base Info Protection because of my unix background. True, 75% of my job is helping the other folks who don't know what their doing administer their NT servers, but I at least get the satisfaction of playing with some BSDi occasionally. <br /><br />At home, I run a Debian system. I learned on Slackware (hooah) and Caldera, but moved on to Debian. I tried using Redhat and Mandrake off and on, but was never really impressed. Right now, I am using Mandrake 9.0, and am fairly impressed, but I miss apt-get upgrade. When I get home (because I'm currently deployed) I play to make my primary desktop a Gentoo system. I helped with the initial beta, but stopped working with D. Robbins shortly after it went to 1.0. <br /><br />I hope to get to know you all (even though I know one or two of you :)) and look forward to being a regular.<br /><br />Regards,<br />DG</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Rugmonster,<br /><br />Hi and welcome! &nbsp;Always glad to have new members, etc, etc, and I'm sure we all look forward to seeing you at the meetings, if you get a chance to go to one. (Though technically, our upcoming meeting isn't really much of a meeting as it is a party &nbsp;8) )<br /><br />crowe</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello Brother-in-law.<br /><br />Welcome aboard. Any time you want to hop on a big plane and come visit us, you are welcome. Of course, you may have to give the officers of the group a ride on your plane. :lol: <br /><br />David<br />VP (that's an officer position)</div>
