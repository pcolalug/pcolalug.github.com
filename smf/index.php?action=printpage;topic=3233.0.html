					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hope LUG members living in the Pensacola area&nbsp; fared OK in the last two days of heavy weather.<br /><br />Here is a little of what was experienced out on Pensacola Beach.&nbsp; Thursday before sundown 10+ inches of rain.&nbsp; Frequent short power outages.&nbsp; Some damage to houses on Panferio --- notably the landmark Spaceship House.&nbsp; <br /><br />The automated weather station at the elementary school stopped transmitting at some point overnight.&nbsp; Rain at nearby Gulf Breeze High School 9+ inches since midnight.&nbsp; Looks as if we have caught up on the drought in 48 hours.<br /><br />No data loss or fried hardware at my place.<br /><br />sandspur<br /><br />http://www.pcola.com/sandspur/ (http://www.pcola.com/sandspur/)<br /><br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That&#039;s some pretty rough weather you had there last week.<br /><br />My dad called and said &quot;I don&#039;t know if you have been watching the news today, but we had a tornado come through this morning. We are OK. I thought you might be worried.&quot;<br /><br />I am sure it was all quite scary and worrisome if you lived there, but I don&#039;t think my dad realizes that a tornado in Pensacola is not going to be picked up on international news and be broadcast here in Mexico.</div>
