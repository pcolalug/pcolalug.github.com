					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I will be there to pick one up. &nbsp;I tell you what. &nbsp;I am going to focus on trying to build a custom kernel for suse after I get 9.2 installed, which I have never done before in the first place. &nbsp;I really like Suse. &nbsp;I gave Slack a whirl a while back after listening to danc and seawolf gave me a few nudges a while back and slack does seem snappier and more streamlined. &nbsp;If I could compile a custom kernel in suse and have the snappiness (is that even a word? :D ) of my slackware tryout. &nbsp;I will be one happy camper. &nbsp;<br /><br />Lee</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I found a gottcha in 9.2 last night. <br /><br />I've been wrestling with getting my network printer to work and also to get a program called &quot;synergy&quot; working. (Allows a mouse and keyboard to traverse computers by moving the cursor to the edge of the screen) Neither one of them would work. I finally figured out that 9.2 activates it's firewall by default. I went in and shut down the firewall (You can do this easily in YAST, and all is fine.)<br /><br /><br />Steve</div>

The function scope of FTP versions is virtually the same as that of the &quot;normal&quot; version. Merely a few program packages have been excluded due to license reasons. The installation support is not included either.&quot;<br /><br />Other than that, just the knowledge that you're financially supporting the further development of a product you enjoy using and keeping programmers employed for a while longer.<br /><br />Steve</div>
