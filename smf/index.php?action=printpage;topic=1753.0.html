					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi all,<br /><br />I have a question. &nbsp;I've thought about using gnome 2.6.1 on my parents machine. &nbsp;It's a 466mhz celeron, it's got 64mb of ram. &nbsp;I usually use fluxbox on this computer because it's the lightest/fastest around. &nbsp;However, I'd like to have a good set of built in applications. &nbsp;<br /><br />KDE is nice , but i think out of the question in this case. &nbsp;I thought about using fluxbox and kde apps independent of the desktop, but the problem with that is, whenever a kde ap is ran, quite &nbsp;abit of kde is ran with it.<br /><br />I thought about xfce but it doesn't really have that many apps bundled with it.<br /><br />So, my question, is gnome 2.6 lean enough for 64mb of ram?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If KDE won't run on it, Gnome won't be any better. Just because XFCE4 doesn't have many included apps doesn't mean you can't install the standard Gnome apps or even KDE apps. XFCE4 is built to be fully GTK+ compatible, just using less fluff on the frontend. I don't think you would be giving up much with XFCE4, but gaining a lot of performance.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You're right, though. The thing that &quot;bloats&quot; most KDE apps (maybe Gnome apps as well - don't know if you can do without Bonobo and all that, but emerging a Gnome app has lots of dependencies IME) is the infrastructure (DCOP server, clipper, other crap) that they rely on. I don't know that you can run a desktop-specific application without them. Best bet is to bite the bullet and install the light apps.<br /><br />You know, there ought to be some distros on distrowatch that address this need. If not, one could always re-master a Knoppix CD. Being Debian-based, it doesn't seem that it would be too terribly hard (just time-consuming).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I installed gnome on the machine. &nbsp;It runs, granted slower than fluxbox. &nbsp;<br /><br />My main goal with this is to impliment something my mother can use. &nbsp;<br /><br />Personally, even though I have plenty of ram I use fluxbox mostly. &nbsp;I've learned how to configure it nicely, but it's not a solution for the parents.<br /><br />I want something ultra simplistic, so I'm problobly going to stick with gnome for now.</div>
