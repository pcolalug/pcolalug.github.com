					Title: <b>Modem Wrapper</b><br />

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok, I have always had my linux desktop pc connected to the internet through a cable modem. However, Mediacom has been taking their time fixing the connection since Ivan(which is understandable). Also, a friend of mine has an older computer and no cable or dsl service until they get around to installing it, which is going to be a while. <br /><br />Both my friend and I have some winmodems laying around the house. I could've sworn I remembered reading an article(possibly on slashdot) a while back about a program that wraps the windows driver and allows the winmodem to work under linux. I did some googling and couldn't find what I was looking for. I did find a few Howtos for winmodems, but I was hoping to try that wrapper first. Anyone happen to know what I am talking about and have a link? <br /><br />Also, my friend has WalMart Connect for their internet connection. I heard it is basically AOL with a different GUI. Any ideas how easy it is to get that running under wine? Or is it a better idea just to find a local isp with a cheap dial-up account? <br /><br />Thanks in advance,<br /><br />Todd</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Are you referring to ndis? It's at http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/. <br /><br />No idea about the rest of your post; though in my experience, I'd say you'd be probably better off finding a local dial-up provider than with hoping to make one of the 'pre-packaged' ISP offerings work on Linux.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you happen to be a UWF student you have free dialup internet available:<br />http://uwf.edu/its/howto.cfm?id=94<br /><br />Dunno if that helps you just wanted to point it out.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yeah, the ndiswrapper is what I think I remembered seeing. Oh well, looks like I'll just have to use the Howtos and hope I have some supported winmodems lying(laying?) around. Oh, and yes, I am a UWF student and I would use their dial-up service for myself. It is my friend that has WalMart Connect and I thought it might be easier to let them keep using what they had and are used to if possible. Thanks again for the replies.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I had been a Joi Internet (http://getjoi.com/new/index.php) user for a while. They let you do a normal dial up connection without making you use their software. They also have a program for Windows, if you want, to take care of the dialing for you. It costs $9.95 per month if you do a month to month plan.<br /><br />I had a real hard time figuring out how to cancel their service when I moved out of thier service area. I finally found it tucked way deep somewhere. I complained to them about that. I never heard from them as to whether they were going to fix it.<br /><br />They do have some limitations. You cannot be connected for more than 5 hours straight. If you are idle for more than 10 minutes, you get booted. After your 5 hour limit, or being booted for lack of activity, then you have to wait 1 minute before reconnecting. <br /><br />For their cheap price this was fair to me. I used it rarely when I was travelling away from home. But never had any problems with them (except cancelling the service.)</div>
