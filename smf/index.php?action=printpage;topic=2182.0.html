					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just saw this on Suse Linux Forums (http://forums.suselinuxsupport.de/index.php?showtopic=10788&amp;hl=)<br /><br />From Marathon Open Source News (http://source.bungie.org/)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">1/10/05 <br /><br /><b>Marathon Games Now Available for Free </b><br /><br />Marathon, Marathon 2, and Marathon Infinity are now all available free of charge. Marathon 2 and Marathon Infinity are fully compatible with Aleph One; just replace the Marathon 2 or Infinity application with the Aleph One application, and enjoy the benefits of OpenGL graphics, improved networking, and everything else that has been added to the game engine since it went open-source in 2000. <br /><br />You'll find the Marathon games for free at http://trilogyrelease.bungie.org/<br />&nbsp;</div><br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Wow, that's awesome! &nbsp;Guess I've got some downloading to do at home.<br /><br /><br />Since they've got the zip files as well as the sit files I'm assuming it'd probably be less headache for Linux to download the zips?</div>

The Zips will be faster to download. Also, you'll need to get the program to read the game files. &nbsp;(AlephOne) You can get it from their home page. It's the second link on my original post.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Now Aleph One only works for 2 and Infinity, right (at least, when I originally posted something about it I believe that's what the site said). &nbsp;Any idea what to use for 1?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've been trying to build AlephOne and so far am coming up against a brick wall. &nbsp;During the build it's got a problem when it calls gcc. &nbsp;The only thing that's missing during the configure other than speex (which I figured was okay since I don't plan on using game voice...too much hassle on the computer) are the following:<br /><br />checking for Sound_Init in -lSDL_sound... no<br />checking whether we are cross compiling... no<br /><br /><br />I figured neither of those were really important since everything else is fine. &nbsp;So I hit make and I get the following:<br /><br />[...]gcc &nbsp;-g -O2 &nbsp; -o gennmtab &nbsp;gennmtab.o &nbsp;-L/usr/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/lib -lSDL -lpthread -lSDL_image -lSDL_net -llua -llualib -lGL -lpthread -lGLU<br />/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-slackware-linux/3.3.4/../../../../i486-slackware-linux/bin/ld: cannot find -lGLU<br />collect2: ld returned 1 exit status<br />make[3]: *** [gennmtab] Error 1<br />make[3]: Leaving directory `/home/foxx/Downloads/Marathon/AlephOne-20050114/Source_Files/Expat'<br />make[2]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1<br />make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/foxx/Downloads/Marathon/AlephOne-20050114/Source_Files'<br />make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1<br />make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/foxx/Downloads/Marathon/AlephOne-20050114'<br />make: *** [all] Error 2<br /><br />It's something about that -lGLU apparently or something around there but I have no idea. &nbsp;I don't see the ISDL_sound in the compile command so I figure I've got everything it should need for that.<br /><br />I've tried the IRC room, the AIM room, and apparently nobody in either is familiar with building this (everyone just uses precompiled or is on Windows). &nbsp;Any suggestions on where to look, I'm a bit clueless and I'd hate to bother the developers if it's something simple.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">What OpenGL implementation are you using (GLU is an openGL thing like GLUT so you may have to install that)?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hmm, to be perfectly honest I'm not sure, I'll see if I can dig up a package with it. &nbsp;I don't know if it's related but Cube which is OpenGL-based runs perfectly with my nVidia drivers and the OpenGL-based screensavers work flawlessly. &nbsp;When I get home I'll see what I can dig up in the area of OpenGL, thanks for the tip.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think GLU is separate from GLUT. Absolutely buried atm, or I'd do a little more research. Keep us posted and I'll let you know if I run across anything.</div>
