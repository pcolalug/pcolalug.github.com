It's an exhaustive guide that<br />covers everything from the basics to advanced topics, with examples you<br />can use for your own applications.

It touches all the bases, from the Common Language Run-Time (CLR)<br />and key class libraries to the specialized packages for ASP.NET,<br />Windows Forms, XML web services, and data access (ADO.NET). Written for<br />intermediate to advanced VB, C/C++, Java, and Delphi developers, the<br />book is also useful to system leaders and architects who are assessing<br />tools for future projects.<br />http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/dotnetfrmess3/?CMP=NLC-2MV239432998<br /><br />Chapter 2, &quot;The Common Language Runtime,&quot; is available online:<br />http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/dotnetfrmess3/chapter/index.html<br /><br /><br />***Programming .NET Security<br />Order Number: 4427<br />With the spread of web-enabled desktop clients and web server-based<br />applications, developers can no longer afford to treat security as an<br />afterthought. In fact, .NET forces you to address the topic since<br />Microsoft has placed security-related features at the core of the .NET<br />Framework. Even so, carelessness and lack of experience can enable a<br />program to be used in an unintended way. This book shows programmers<br />how to use .NET's various tools to write secure applications.<br />http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/prognetsec/?CMP=NLC-B12M76941348<br /><br />Chapter 4, &quot;The Lifetime of a Secure Application,&quot; is available online:<br />http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/prognetsec/chapter/index.html<br /><br />================================================<br />Upcoming Events<br />================================================<br />***For more events, please see:<br />http://events.oreilly.com/<br /><br /><br />***Jesse Liberty (&quot;Programming C#&quot; &amp; &quot;Programming ASP.NET&quot;), <br />Cape Cod .NET User Group, Hyannis, MA--August 23 Author Jesse Liberty<br />presents an all-day &quot;crash course&quot; on ASP.NET for the Cape Cod .NET<br />User Group. &nbsp;<br />http://www.ccdevgroup.net/<br /><br />Saturday, August 23, 9am-5 pm<br />Cape Cod Community College<br />Hyannis Campus<br />Adult Learning Center<br />540 Main Street<br />Hyannis, MA 02601<br />http://www.capecod.mass.edu/directions/<br /><br />================================================<br />Conference News<br />================================================<br />***What to &quot;See and Do&quot; while you are at the O'Reilly Mac OS X<br />Conference<br />Held in the heart of Silicon Valley, the O'Reilly Mac OS X Conference<br />provides conference attendees and speakers the opportunity to network<br />with peers in a comfortable and enjoyable setting.

Our clients often have<br />varied needs, and they sometimes need help with the latest<br />technologies--if we didn't have the resource we needed to refer to in<br />order to help, we'd have to order a book online or drive out to the<br />local bookstore to browse the shelves and hope they had something we<br />could use. Having Safari online texts at our fingertips gives us a much<br />faster response time providing expertise to our clients. Now that all<br />the text from so many books is available and searchable, we can access<br />that kind of specialized technical knowledge much more quickly from a<br />very reliable source.&quot;<br /><br />Your group can also participate in this introductory program just for<br />user group members. To &quot;Go on Safari,&quot; any of your members who sign up<br />for our Safari 14-day free trial can send comments on their<br />experiences, or tips and tricks for how they used Safari &nbsp;(it only<br />needs to be 2 sentences long, but it may be longer) to<br />safari_talk@oreilly.com. (Please include your UG name in the email.)<br /><br />Every week someone will be chosen from the tips or comments submitted<br />to receive fun stuff from O'Reilly (T-shirts, book bags, or other<br />surprises). If a member of your user group is selected, your group<br />receives free gifts, too. Whatever the individual member receives, your<br />UG will get one, too, to give away at your next meeting, or use however<br />you see fit. Recipients--and their comments--will be announced in the<br />User Group Newsletter.<br /><br />**Please use this special UG URL to sign up for the 14-day trial**<br />http://www.oreilly.com/safari/ug<br /><br />For more information on Safari:<br />http://safari.oreilly.com/<br />================================================<br />News From O'Reilly &amp; Beyond<br />================================================<br />---------------------<br />General News<br />---------------------<br />***When Is 54 Not Equal to 54?<br />&quot;Protection&quot; mechanisms added to 802.11g to ensure backward<br />compatibility with legacy 802.11b clients can cut throughput by 50<br />percent or more. Matthew Gast, author of &quot;802.11 Wireless Networks: The<br />Definitive Guide,&quot; explains.<br />http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/wireless/2003/08/08/wireless_throughput.html?CMP=NLC-2439WB792718<br /><br />802.11 Wireless Networks: The Definitive Guide<br />Order Number: 1835<br />http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/802dot11/<br /><br /><br />***E-Commerce Pioneers Split on Patent Rights<br />In this &quot;Associated Press&quot; article, Tim O'Reilly talks about why he<br />didn't patent the idea of using advertising revenue to run a web portal<br />as a &quot;business method&quot;--a move that would have changed the course of<br />internet history.<br />http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2001274072_btpatents28.html<br /><br /><br />***Introduction to OOP in Flash and ActionScript<br />One of the greatest stumbling blocks in learning object-oriented<br />programming is the inherent abstractness. Enter the simplicity of Flash<br />and ActionScript. In this first of two articles, Joey Lott offers an<br />introduction to basic OOP with ActionScript.<br />http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/javascript/2003/08/12/actionscriptckbk.html<br /><br />Joey is the author of &quot;ActionScript Cookbook.&quot;<br />Order Number: 4907<br />http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/actscptckbk/<br /><br />---------------------<br />Open Source<br />---------------------<br />***Five Lessons You Should Learn from Extreme Programming<br />Extreme Programming (XP) is yet another popular idea gaining press. It<br />adapts the best ideas from the past decades of software development.<br />Whether or not you adopt XP, it's worth considering what XP teaches.<br />chromatic, author of &quot;Extreme Programming Pocket Guide,&quot; offers five<br />lessons you should learn from Extreme Programming.<br />http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2003/07/31/extremeprogramming.html?CMP=NLC-Q87B09432775<br /><br />Extreme Programming Pocket Guide<br />Order Number: 4850<br />http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/extprogpg/index.html<br /><br />---------------------<br />Java<br />---------------------<br />***The Java Speech API, Part 1<br />Speech technology has advanced to the point where it's practical to<br />consider speech synthesis and speech recognition in certain<br />applications. In the first of two articles, Mandar Chitnis and Lakshmi<br />Ananthamurthy explore JSAPI, an API for accessing various speech<br />engines, building a simple application with speech synthesis.<br />http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/08/06/jsapi.html?CMP=NLC-4G1A98664309<br /><br />---------------------<br />.NET<br />---------------------<br />***The Factory Design Pattern<br />Many popular software libraries make extensive use of design patterns<br />so that the APIs can be abstracted out at a high level for the end<br />programmer. The .NET Framework Class Library (FCL) is no exception.<br />Given that the FCL builds on the strengths of Microsoft's experience<br />with developing software libraries, one can assume that instances of<br />design patterns found in the FCL are fairly appropriate usages of these<br />patterns. In this article, Amit Goel describes some instances of a<br />commonly occurring design pattern in the FCL: the Factory Method design<br />pattern.<br />http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2003/08/11/factorypattern.html<br /><br />---------------------<br />XML<br />---------------------<br />***Comments in a &quot;No comment&quot; World<br />In this month's XML Q&amp;A column, John E. Simpson examines two issues<br />related to documentation of, and comments in, XML documents and<br />schemas. &nbsp;<br />http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/07/30/qa.html<br /><br />---------------------<br />Mac<br />---------------------<br />***Outboard Brains for Mac OS X<br />Here's a brief look at some applications designed to be digital<br />brain-dumps; electronic Pensieves into which you can throw any<br />information you want, knowing that it will still be there when you need<br />it later. Giles Turnbull looks at a variety of &quot;outboard brains&quot;<br />utilities and highlights their particular strengths.<br />http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2003/08/05/outboard_brains.html<br /><br />***Open Directory and Active Directory, Part 1<br />For the last number of months, Michael Bartosh has been working on this<br />series of articles for Mac DevCenter readers that examines Mac OS X's<br />Directory Services architecture in depth and explores how to integrate<br />these services with Microsoft's Active Directory.<br />http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2003/08/05/active_directory.html?CMP=NLC-J9A196900446<br /><br />This is the same topic that Michael will be discussing in person at the<br />O'Reilly Mac OS X Conference.<br />http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/macosx2003/view/e_sess/4513<br /><br />================================================<br />Fun Stuff<br />================================================''<br />***Take the Geek Test<br />http://www.innergeek.us/geek.html</div>
