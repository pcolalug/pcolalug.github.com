					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">OK Im really trying here.<br /><br />I had RH9 a few months ago. and got rid of it for the same reason i have millions of times. Err it wont run all the things i need it to properly.<br /><br />FIXED THAT HAHA! (i love you wine)<br /><br />But now I've run into a snag. My roomate has a computer now, and we've been running them both on a lan that looks ungefahr like this<br /><br />CABLE MODEM(WAN) --- (ROUTER) -| Comp1 <br />                                                        | Comp2<br /><br />When i first put RH9 on i setup the network the gateway the whole shebang..it worked fine for about 2 reboots. then just stopped on me. I re-did the settings reset the router tried again. And NOTHING. maybe im a retard and im missing something. Maybe my 'fubar special setup' of my lan is whats doing it but it works fine for XP. Dont make me buy another d**n net card.<br /><br />Advice/Comments/Answers<br /><br />-Nexus One</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">first from prompt try ifconfig and see if eth0 comes up and looks correct.<br />Second from the prompt service network restart That should shut everything down and restart on the network side.<br /><br />Check your cable make sure it is good..Check with known good cable.<br />Also on boot up does eth0 come up.<br />You also could try dmesg|grep eth0 from the prompt to see if this gives you any ideas.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yes it will sound odd but what router are you using? I have seen a very rare case where this same sort of thing happend on an old model of linksys routers. (1 or 2 ports i think)<br /><br /><br />Most likely not it but worth a shot.</div>
