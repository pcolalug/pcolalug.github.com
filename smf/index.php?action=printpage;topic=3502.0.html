					Title: <b>PS3 Linux</b><br />

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you follow my facebook then you&#039;ll have already seen this, but last night was spent installing Linux to my friend&#039;s PS3.&nbsp; There are a million and one tutorials on how to do this, so I won&#039;t go into great detail unless asked.&nbsp; We used PSUbuntu, a specially modified version of Ubuntu 8.10 for PowerPC architectures which comes with the appropriate files and drivers to install to the PS3.<br /><br />GNOME lags on it, however LXDE flys on it, and provides the same functionality.&nbsp; There aren&#039;t many PPC packages out there, so most of the programs we want to install will have to be compiled from source, which shouldn&#039;t be a major problem.&nbsp; OpenOffice, GIMP, Firefox, all work fine and seems just like a regular desktop.&nbsp; I installed VLC and there was some video output problems which was easily fixed, that works just fine.<br /><br />My first problem I ever had with linux, corrupting the boot record, is actually no longer a problem with the PS3 as apparently one of the newer updates has a fail-safe to return to Sony&#039;s XMB.&nbsp; However, this was only a problem once, but I was able to fix it by using the shell with Kboot, a special boot loader.<br /><br />Getting the six-axis to work with the PS3 was surprisingly straightforward, but the button mapping has become a problem when playing games.<br /><br />If you have any questions, feel free to ask.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Is this a dual boot setup? What kind of games are you running on the Linux system that makes this so cool?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yes, this is a dual boot.&nbsp; To get from the Sony OS you have to set the default system to the &quot;Other OS&quot; and reboot, and if you want to get back to the Sony OS (the XMB) you use the command &quot;boot-game-os&quot; which restarts the system into the XMB.<br /><br />You need a USB keyboard &amp; mouse to do this of course.<br /><br />As for games, so far I&#039;ve installed an Atari 2600 emulator, a NES emulator and a Super Nintendo emulator.&nbsp; They run amazingly and it&#039;s a lot more convenient than bringing them wherever we go and hooking them up.</div>
