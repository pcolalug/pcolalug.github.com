					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Disclaimer: in no way am I suggesting that we all go out and take matters into our own hands and such. Nor do I suggest that we all do what I am about to start a discussion on. These are just some rants and thoughts going thru my head..........<br />Do not do this ................You have been warned!<br /><br />Ok looking at the logs everyday and seeing how many machines are infected out there and the tools availble to us.<br />Why not take out some of these drones that are out there sending out spam and being used as proxys for attacks on us?<br />Yes It is just vague attempts, But it is an attack never the less! If I come up and punch you or attempt said event you have every right <br />to defend yourself. If someone was attempting to break into your house you now have the right to use Lethal force to protect you and your family.<br />Then why not a computer attacker? Are they not the same thing? Maybe even more dangourous! This is the fastest growing crime.<br />And you know It would not be that hard to use existing tools or script your ownt to get the ip&#039;s from your logs and deliver a crippling attack to them.<br />Yes the general word is don&#039;t even think it! <br />Well most of our hack attacks come from state sponsored countries like China, North Korea and Iran!<br />Wow those are some surprises there! So we turn a blind eye and just build better walls and keep the staus quo, But what if we started taking out the proxies and the drones and forced there locations .......every battle would bring us closer to finding the real threat.<br />Then the real war begins....This is one that goes one every day and no one even notices.<br />Just the other day three of the dns servers that handle the internet traffic were hacked they were in there for hours before anybody even knew!<br />Just probing the statement was ..................Probing for what?<br />over 70% of our infrastucture is based on computers from hospitals to traffic lights. What if?<br /><br />What if before a major assault they took down our network ability........or took down every computer in the country?<br />I am sure every one of you have seen just locally where your life was affected when just one computer went down.<br />either paying bills or needing to access some account in a hurry that was not availble.<br />Imagine this on a country wide scale!<br /><br />Well that&#039;s it for now more to come...<br /><br />Well I have been studing this in detail and reading every obscure news article including the federal security news letter.<br />Cyber-warfare is a real event is a real thing this comes down from real IT Security pro&#039;s and Military brass.<br />Also there has been a wide spread of attacks over all sort of infrastructure points...<br />Water System control hacked in New england. Traffic light hacked in Midwest.....banks with usb drives in the parking lot&#039;s, Not to even mention all the credit card grabs might as well post your info on your front door. <br />Point being yes we have trained people that handle this.....NSA iis probally the front line and I have a friend that works for them and they are good...As Rugmunster mentioned the Air Force has taken on the Cyber warfare.<br />But they are not there to protect us..................only infrastructure!!!<br />So again what are we to do...Latest predictions are that 1000&#039;s to tens of 1000&#039;s of bot nets are out there.<br />These are used for such things as denial of service attacks..........hmmmmmm..............<br />1000&#039;s to ten&#039;s of 1000&#039;s of peoples computers completly open and being used is Your&#039;s?<br /><br />On closing reading the federal news letter...on the DNS server attack it was a low level DDos attack, On the front side. But even they admit they do not know yet what additional damange may have been done to the DNS nodes by something slipping by....It was in there words a well thought out attack . With many forks and several distractions.<br />Actual full Penatration hack or DDos still do the same thing stop me from using that service.<br />And from the People that run the DNS servers stated that just 2 coming down slowed the web in certain areas tremendously.<br /><br /><br />And no I am not paranoid.....................................<br />I know they are out to get me!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This is such a bad idea on so many different levels.<br /><br />First, by taking out the drones, you are likely taking out the computers of folks that don&#039;t realize what their systems are doing. <br /><br />Second, there are way too many drones out there to make a dent in them.<br /><br />Third, legally, you would be playing on the same grounds as the folks running the botnets, thus being in the United States, be subject to United States laws and United States fines and jails.<br /><br />Fourth, so you start taking out nodes and draw the attention of the person controlling the botnet and all of the sudden, you are the target of a DDoS. Your ISP gets pissed at you and drops your service and holds you liable for damages. Yes, it&#039;s a stretch for the damages, not so much the dropping of service.<br /><br />Fifth, you&#039;re spreading of fear is uncalled for. Traffic systems, hospitals, critical infrastructures that are on IP based networks are typically off Internet connected networks. If you know of any that are accessible via the Internet, even through a firewall, then you need to let someone know the error of their ways, both as a responsible citizen and a network security professional.<br /><br />In case you hadn&#039;t heard, the USAF recently changed their mission to Air, Space, and Cyberspace Superiority. Leave it to the professionals. If you are so bothered by it, do a whois on the IP and send an email to or call the technical contact for the network. Notify your ISP and let them handle it. If you are actually compromised, contact the authorities, though likely won&#039;t do you any good if the attacker is from outside the US. Vigilantism isn&#039;t any more right on the Internet than it is in the real world. If you don&#039;t need to provide services to users outside the US, then block those IP blocks. It&#039;s not hard to find out what they are.<br /><br />Just like you lock up your car and your house to keep people out of your stuff, why should you expect anything different for your computers? The Internet falls in no one jurisdiction. By its nature, you cannot realistically control it. If there were a way, I doubt the RIAA or MPAA would be spending money on adverts to convince people that pirating music and movies is bad.<br /><br />Lastly, the root servers were not hacked. Three were targeted (http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/I/INTERNET_ATTACKS?SITE=WIRE&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT) by botnets (http://www.us-cert.gov/current/current_activity.html#dnsanom) and were DDoS&#039;d (http://dnsmon.ripe.net/dns-servmon/domain/plot?domain=root&amp;day=5&amp;month=2&amp;year=2007&amp;hour=16&amp;period=48h&amp;plot%2F=SHOW---). If you have something that states otherwise, I would like to see it.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yes, I completely agree with ruggy here.&nbsp; The sort of things you proposed would be *really* dumb.&nbsp; <br /><br />Then again, I avoid putting anything in writing while I&#039;m angry for just this reason, you rarely come away from it with a rational argument.<br /><br />I will however, tell you the story of my own experience, back in the day.&nbsp; I used to play online with a clan, and a buddy of mine got hacked.&nbsp; Well, we got the attackers address (this was before the days of ddos&#039;ing botnets).&nbsp; Anyway, I did an hour or so of research, and wound up with the phone number registered to the owner of the account.&nbsp; Turns out, the kid&#039;s father wasn&#039;t very happy when we explained why his ISP account had been canceled.&nbsp; The kid disappeared off the net for a whole six months before returning a much humbler opponent.&nbsp; That was fairly rewarding, even though I doubt the same could be done today.<br /><br />These days, you&#039;re really better off just locking down your systems as best as possible.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I actually advocate contacting the ISP of offenders if you can get that information. With a lot of luck, the ISP will do something about it, but since the days of the small ISP are over, the security centers for the mega-ISPs are going to ignore simple brute force attempts and port scans.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">A little update!<br /><br />Believe it or not I do this for a living now and do research some of this before I open my trap.<br />Point in case.<br />http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11465?ref=rss<br /><br />Apparently a nuclear reactor in alabama had to be manually shut down August 2006 after thier water pumps had a failure <br />from a &quot;data storm&quot;<br /><br />January 2003, the Slammer worm disrupted systems of Ohio&#039;s Davis-Besse nuclear power plant.<br /><br />In August 2003, nearly 50 million homes in the northeastern U.S. and neighboring Canadian provinces suffered from a loss of power after early warning systems failed to work properly, allowing a local outage to cascade across several power grids. A number of factors contributed to the failure, including a bug in a common energy management system and the MSBlast, or Blaster, worm which quickly spread among systems running Microsoft Windows, eventually claiming more than 25 million systems.<br /><br />I guess not all of our major functions are off internet! It only takes one stupid engineer to put something as simple as a PLC on the network.<br />In order to make his life easier.<br /><br />Wow do we all know what happens if you do not get cooling water to the reactor?<br /><br />BOOM!<br /><br />Good thing they do still have people on site to do the monitoring :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you look at page 2 of the SecurityFocus article, you find the following:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">No digital contagion has been fingered in the latest incident, said Terry Johnson, spokesman for the Tennessee Valley Authority, the public power company that runs the Browns Ferry power plant.<br /><br />&quot;The integrated control system (ICS) network is not connected to the network outside the plant, but it is connected to a very large number of controllers and devices in the plant,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;You can end up with a lot of information, and it appears to be more than it could handle.&quot;<br /><br />The device responsible for flooding the network with data appears to be a programmable logic controller (PLC) connected to the plant&#039;s Ethernet network, according to an NRC information notice on the incident (PDF). The PLC controlled Unit 3&#039;s condensate demineralizer -- essentially a water softener for nuclear plants. The flood of data spewed out by the malfunctioning controller caused the variable frequency drive (VFD) controllers for the recirculation pumps to hang.<br /><br />Such failures are common among PLC and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, because the manufacturers do not test the devices&#039; handling of bad data, said Dale Peterson, CEO of industrial system security firm DigitalBond.<br /><br />&quot;What is happening in this marketplace is that vendors will build their own (network) stacks to make it cheaper,&quot; Peterson said. &quot;And it works, but when (the device) gets anything that it didn&#039;t expect, it will gag.&quot;<br /><br />In many cases, a simple vulnerability scan will even cause the devices to crash, Peterson said. During tests in an electrical substation, Nessus running in safe scan mode crashed devices, he said. In some cases, sending out broadcast data on the network will crash several of connected devices, he added.<br /><br />&quot;If you were to test any control systems that have any more than three or four different network-connected devices, they could be knocked over very easily,&quot; Peterson said.</div><br />To me, it sounds like that has nothing to do with any external malicious attack and more to do with crappy equipment.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well I am back on my soap box again , For round three!!!<br />Security is becoming an over increasing nightmare. Adobe acrobat has a serious vulnerability and if that was not enough our power grid is acknowledged to have serious holes and countless trojans buried in it by god knows who. And even the FBI who has uber funds for cyber defense had there head handed to them by an apparently random act of sabotage.<br />Well Boys and Girls I am hear to tell you to prepare cause war is on the horizon. If Obama places who I think for the new cyber defense czar then he will be hardcore hit them first before they hit us and we are all going to be stuck in the middle. Keep your antivirus and firewalls dry and fill the moat or better yet disconnect from the net fore it&#039;s going to be a bumpy ride.......<br />Maybe I had the wrong idea with a hacking counter measures but we sure need something and the federal government ain&#039;t got nothing yet to compete.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Your Welcome,<br /><br />And several of our networks in this country are suffering major ddos attacks as we speak. They are talking about it a lot in the sans forums.<br /><br />And it is a well known fact that that north Korea and China are both state sponsored hackers. And again it is a known fact that they have been mapping our networks<br />for years to find our weaknesses of which we have many. Hopefully the new cyber czar appointed by Obama will have some solutions.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Wow Looks like I was going into the right direction.<br />With warfare moving into the digital age at an alarming rate. There is now policy being adopted to start attacking <br />targets that threaten national security. Now a days that could cover anything. Everyone has been watching the stuxnet worm.<br />But I guarantee you this has not been the only one nor the last.<br />I now have 500 firewalls across the country and on every major ISP. I am getting logs from all of these and one<br />thing I can say for a fact! that we are constantly being probed and tested to see where the weak links are to hit in an attack.<br />I see this in my logs and the great thing about cyber warfare is that you can probe all day and generally not break the law to the <br />extent that you will be prosecuted. If I was in Iran now taking pictures and gathering target info I would be shot!<br /></div>
