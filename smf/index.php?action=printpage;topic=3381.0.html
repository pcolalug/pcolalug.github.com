					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It&#039;s been suggested that weekend meetings could be less desirable for our members.&nbsp; They could interfere with social events on Saturday evenings, and they usually mean an extra trip in to town, just for us.&nbsp; It has been proposed that our meeting date be changed to a weekday so that it&#039;s more convenient for people who are in town anyways, for work, to make it.&nbsp; I think a day like Wednesday or Thursday would be great for our meetings, since Friday can still be a social night, and people are really just ready to get home and relax then too.<br /><br />Please vote for a day, and then suggest a time of day for the meeting to occur.&nbsp; Our current time of 6pm may be too early for some people who get off of work at that time.&nbsp; Also, I don&#039;t think we should change which week in the month the meeting occurs, the third x day of the month seems like a good formula to keep.<br /><br />Ian</div>

Also change of location may be Cici&#039;s pizza or someplace similar.&nbsp; Won&#039;t be too busy in there, we can get seats way in the back and gab and grub.&nbsp; Everyone has to eat, lets give them an additional (and cheap) reason to come!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">anything but tuesday night, friday night, and sunday if we are getting it away from weekends. A wednesday/thursday night is fine with me. <br /><br />As far as location change, I don&#039;t have any opinion. I mean, if it&#039;s a weekday night, I just stay late after work.... I get off around 4:30-5, so maybe if we keep same location then move time up a bit if possible for others?</div>

That is a social gathering, just some people with linux in common eating together. If you can have some sort of presentation at a pizza joint think how much better you can have the presentation in a classroom atmosphere like we have now. But if we can&#039;t even have presentations now what makes anyone think going to a pizza joint is going to fix that. I would not be interested in driving 40 or 50 miles to eat pizza or chicken for that matter (and I love chicken) just to chat with folks I hardly know. This is backing up. It doesn&#039;t take much effort to go to a eatery and eat and call it a linux meeting and how does that promote linux or increase you knowledge of linux. I would not be interested in going to those &quot;meetings&quot; but I doubt I will be attending any meetings anyway based on the current location distance and what is going on at the meetings we have now. If you can&#039;t improve it where it is now going to an eatery certainly is not going to do any good. If you want a social club call it that and not a linux user&#039;s group.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I agree that a pizza joint might not be the best location for a linux meeting.&nbsp; Especially when it comes to presentations.<br /><br />Also, Ci Ci&#039;s pizza is a little too far away for me (living in Perdido) unless it&#039;s on a monday or wednesday, as those are days I have rather late classes at UWF and am already on that side of town.</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">We started on Thursday nights. I like Thursdays at 7:00. I don&#039;t like Wednesday at all.<br /><br />I don&#039;t mind the eating establishment, but it needs to be some place that has a separate room that we can have presentations in. Where we are now works well unless we need a venue change. We started in a couple of the big book stores in town. But there was no place to really put on a good presentation.<br /><br />I will be back in country this next year starting in September. But I don&#039;t know how often I will be able to make it to meetings. If I am in Pcola, I will make every meeting possible. But I happen to know that some months I will be hundreds of miles away. I would like to be involved while I am back home.</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m inclined to agree that we don&#039;t really need a venue change, the only real reason it was ever brought up is because there have been a couple times that our keyholder wasn&#039;t able to make it to the meetings, and we&#039;ve had to arrange to get a key from him beforehand, or in the case of our last meeting, just kind of hang out outside.&nbsp; If we put the meetings on a weekday, that problem goes away, because our key holder works where we have our meetings.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, yes, we would need to find a restaurant with a separate room for holding meetings in, and the ability to support a projector plus screen.&nbsp; We would also need to find a projector and screen, something our current venue already has on location. :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am good with Any night basically. I agree that a food venue would not be a good idea! We have tried this in the past and it causes a lot of distractions and such not to mention if I was paying to eat nearby O would not want to hear some rant going on :)<br />Anyway I am good where we are now and I think the weekday night idea might get us a better turnout and also works better for lloyd also I think!<br />Anyway just my 2 pennies</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve been wanting to come to a meeting for about a year now, but because it&#039;s been on Saturdays I can never make it. I have a pretty busy social life and Saturdays are usually taken up all the time. I voted for Thursday because I currently have nothing to do on Thursday nights. So, if it&#039;s that night, you&#039;ll most likely have one more person coming. Also, if it&#039;s a weeknight, please do the meeting around 6pm. That way we can just come right after work. Anyway, just my 2 cents.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">What about the place y&#039;all have been meeting? Since I haven&#039;t been to a meeting yet, I&#039;m not sure what the situation is. Also, just because you don&#039;t meet at food place doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t have snacks and such. Just try to have everyone bring something. If that&#039;s already happening, then never mind. <br /><br />It seems people will come for two reasons: Linux and social. If you have a boring time, but it has linux, well, then it&#039;s not going to be very appealing. But, if you have social and no linux, well, then there&#039;s no point. Heck, have a meeting and then afterward, if people want to stay and play games or cards and hang out, then do that. But, like I said, this is coming from someone who hasn&#039;t been to a meeting so I might be speaking out of my rear. <br /><br />As far as getting more people, since we&#039;re dealing with Linux, it&#039;s not going to be as easy. Even the IT department at my job thought I was a nerd for playing around with Linux.&nbsp; :P </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It should not be that hard to get the word out and get new guys to come. I have at least one downtown computer service company that wants to start coming an d there office is right across the road from the meeting location and also the City of Pensacola which is in the middle of a full migration to Linux would probally come also....btw I did get the word they are moving forward and already using edbuntu for some of there outreach stations and moving to system wide open-office vs MS office 2008.........can we say Yea! that is a hugh move for Linux in the local area.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, it&#039;s been six months since this issue was decided...&nbsp; I&#039;ve not been to a meeting since then (for several reasons), but wanted to ask how everyone thinks this is working out.&nbsp; Has there been any benefit by moving the date?&nbsp; More attendees?&nbsp; Fewer?&nbsp; I see that there have been a few new faces on the forums, and wonder what they think about this.<br /><br />I would like to get re-involved with the LUG, but I must say that weekday evenings are not good for me, as I am often still working at the scheduled meeting time.&nbsp; I have had some issues with some of the members regarding the administration of the LUG, but I think anyone who knows me can attest to the fact that I can offer the LUG a lot in the way of help and knowledge, including presentations.&nbsp; I liked the meetings on Saturdays, myself.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t really matter what time on Saturday (perhaps earlier than 6pm would be better?).<br /><br />Is this something that the rest of the LUG members are willing to re-address?&nbsp; Is Thursday locked in, and everyone is happy with it?&nbsp; If so, I&#039;ll be quiet and leave things be.&nbsp; I likely will not be able to attend, but might possibly make it.&nbsp; Would anyone like to move things back to Saturday, and combine the meeting with some ordered-in pizza and a presentation (like we used to do for LAN parties)?&nbsp; How about a LAN party or Installfest?&nbsp; Anyone up for that?&nbsp; Those certainly would go better on a Saturday.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thoughts?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m percectly happy with the new date and time.&nbsp; It&#039;s far more convenient than on a Saturday when people usually have other events going on.<br /><br />However, for a special event such as an installfest or LAN party, Saturday would be wiser choice.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">My schedule is flexible so that any day but Sunday works fine. IF I am in town I can make the meeting. It is a matter of being in town.<br /><br />It seems that people, in general, like the Thursday time. However, a special Saturday event would be great.<br /><br />We need to work up an installfest sometime soon. I don&#039;t know how many people need much help like in the past. But if for no other reason it would give us a chance to grill dogs or order pizza.</div>
