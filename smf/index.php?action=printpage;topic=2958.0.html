					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I found an article on slashdot that ranked locations according to their pay vs COL when it comes to IT jobs.<br /><br />Surprisingly, Montgomery, Al came up very high on the list, thanks mostly to the defense contractor jobs Associated with Maxwell AFB.<br /><br />http://www.forbes.com/technology/2006/08/01/technology-careers-jobs_cx_pm_0801techjobs.html?partner=rss</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">As I&#039;ve said on Slashdot and to the local Monty LUG, I completely disagree with that article. Not only does the job market here suck, the pay is NOT that good. I base this on a comparison with San Antonio, where I&#039;m looking at jobs. The cost of living in San Antonio, a larger city, is actually marginally lower. Pay for the same positions is better (perhaps due to more private corporate jobs). In Montgomery, unless you&#039;re lucky, you&#039;ll be stuck working for a government contractor or the state. Either way, you&#039;re working for the government and that just isn&#039;t much fun. Montgomery is dead for any culture or community activities. The people here suck (rude, racist, dumb and crappy drivers). The housing market is bloated. AND WHERE THE HELL DID THEY FIND SOMEONE TO SAY THE SCHOOLS ARE GREAT?!?! All I here from parents is how much they suck, but can&#039;t afford private school!<br /><br />I hate it here! &gt;:( <br /><br />Oh yeah, to get a job, you pretty much&nbsp; HAVE to know the right people. You can&#039;t just move here and expect to search on Monster or Dice to find a job. Also, if you do anything other than Windows, Cisco, Oracle, .NET, or J2EE there&#039;s hardly anything here for you. Also, the people that are in the industry here are mostly morons. Dumb as bricks.<br /><br />So San Antonio, look out. Rugmonster is coming in 2008.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">1. Job market, especially for clearance holding people, is better than Montgomery and Pensacola<br />2. Wife has two grad schools to choose from to finish her degree<br />3. Cost of living is cheaper than Montgomery and Pensacola<br />4. Big city (which we both like) (culturally diverse, lower ratio of @$$hats, etc)<br />5. Austin is within an hour&#039;s drive<br />6. No hurricanes<br />7. Free child care (wife&#039;s mother (she&#039;s already offered and wants an excuse to retire))<br /><br />That&#039;s why!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Rug,<br /><br />Aren&#039;t you currently active duty in the Air Force?&nbsp; You know, someone coming from the military would have a fairly easy time landing a civilian job with the fed, from what I&#039;ve heard.&nbsp; Also, I&#039;ve *heard* that the federal civ jobs are some of the best in the state when you factor in both pay and benifits.<br /><br />Then again, I&#039;m very confused over the whole public sector vs private sector thing.&nbsp; On the one hand, I&#039;ve consistantly heard that public sector jobs pay poor salaries, and on the other I&#039;ve heard that while they pay a couple grand below the private sector, but more than make up for it in benifits.&nbsp; Honestly, there is very little advice on the web on the subject.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-\<br /><br />Edit:&nbsp; Well, there *is* information availible, but it&#039;s all published by the government as hiring propaganda, so it&#039;s a little untrustworthy</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m getting out of the AF because of the cutbacks. Since the majority of the GS position in this area are associated with the AF, there are planned cuts for them as well. This means that my outlook on GS is not so bright and shiny.<br /><br />GS used to be a sweet gig. The stability was rock solid, pay was pretty good and the benefits were outstanding. They&#039;ve cut back on the benefits, though they are still better than most private sector jobs. The pay is okay and you get a pension, but you can make more in the private sector and build a better retirement on your own (because you&#039;d have to do that anyway if you planned on retiring from a GS position). I&#039;m not going to turn down a GS job, but I really don&#039;t want to work for the government any more. It wears on you and I&#039;m tired of feeling mostly unsatisfied and less than challenged in my job.<br /><br />One more thing...GS positions typically supervise the contractors, so you end up being a project manager and I enjoy being a techie. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve been doing some further research on the subject.<br /><br />I found the pay schedual policy for AA, BA, MS and PHD degrees.<br />http://www.opm.gov/qualifications/SEC-II/s2-e5.asp<br /><br />And, combine that with the gs pay table for IT workers<br />http://apps.opm.gov/SSR/tables/index.cfm<br /><br />It seems someone with a BA starts off making 34,769.&nbsp; <br />With good grades, you can eventually get promted to GS-7 which starts off at 41,508.<br /><br />Consider, most of the software dev positions around here start out at around 48,000.<br /><br />Are the federal benifits worth the $13k a year trade off?&nbsp; I&#039;m not so sure. <br /><br />Now, I&#039;m not a materialistic person.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather make less money, and have time off to actually enjoy life, than bust my butt working 60 hour weeks.&nbsp; I just hope I can find a dev job that strikes a nice balance.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here&#039;s an overview of the benefits for GS employees<br /><br />About.com&#039;s Page (http://usgovinfo.about.com/blbenefits.htm)<br />USAJobs&#039; more in-depth info (http://www.usajobs.opm.gov/ei61.asp)<br /><br />The health insurance costs around $300/mo for a family, which is comparable with that of other plans that I&#039;ve seen. The retirement package seems to be mostly what you put into it. The leave is the big difference from what I can tell. The job security definitely isn&#039;t what it used to be, but some would argue it&#039;s better than non-government jobs. In this day and age though, your best bet is to change jobs to increase your salary or position. If you&#039;re more into being a manager, then I suppose it would be alright, but I like doing the technical work. To me, none of that is worth a trade off in take home pay. The more I take home, the more I can invest in my own retirement and the more I can make plans should a gap in work arise. Stability is all relative and I think, to a certain degree, what you make of it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I agree with Rugmonster, if I had to move San Antonio would be my first choise.&nbsp; Be very careful and save loads of money. I have been unemployed now for 13 months!!! You can be over qualified, certified, degreed and it doesn&#039;t make a difference. You must have connections!!! </div>
