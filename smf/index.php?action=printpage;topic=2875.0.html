					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">With so much emphasis put on the fastest (and most expensive) cards available, it&#039;s nice to see some numbers from the budget end of the video card spectrum.&nbsp; Reviewed are the Chrome S27, GeForce 7300 GS, and Radeon X1300 Pro; cards all coming in under the $80 mark. To my surprise, according to the numbers, they don&#039;t suck that bad! Look for yourself...<br /><br />http://techreport.com/reviews/2006q2/budget-gpus/index.x?pg=1</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It is nice, I guess, to see some attention paid to the lower-range cards.&nbsp; My take on this though, is that I don&#039;t really see myself ever buying something in this range, because if I want a gaming machine, I&#039;ll get an expensive card, and for a server/non-gamer I would only need a cheapo ($20) card (even an old PCI non-3D).&nbsp; The middle-of-the-road category doesn&#039;t seem to serve much purpose, IMHO.<br /><br />Dan<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">They serve a purpose for those who have a limited budget and need something to start off with. I am thinking of the college student who may not have a whole lot of money, needs a system to do their homework/research on, but would like to casually play a game on the weekend. These cards seem to be up to the task. They won&#039;t produce top performance, but they will get the job done. You can&#039;t complain about the price for performance. When you&#039;ve got less than $1000 to put together a system, these make for great options, if you ask me.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have nothing to add, save to say that it&#039;s certainly interesting to see an offering from S3 that can more or less hold its own against similiarly-classed ATI &amp; Nvidia cards.</div>
