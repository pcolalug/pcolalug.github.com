					Title: <b>Help - Bluetooth Headsetr how to</b><br />
					Post by: <b>keith_s</b> on <b>May 22, 2008, 01:06:44 pm</b>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This is an open question....Im 6 weeks into&nbsp; linux so realize a little hand holdiong would be appreciated.&nbsp; I have spent 6 weeks trying to install bluetooth for headsets and getting it to work. I tried the following distro&#039;s Ubuntu 7.10 &amp; 8.04, kubuntu 8.04, Debian 4.03r etch, Fedora 8 and 9. I like fedora but i can not get a blue tooth headset to work in any distro. I have purchased &quot;Linux Phrasebook&quot;; &quot;Linux annoyances for Geeks&quot;, &quot;Fedora Linux Toolbox&quot; , and &quot;Fedora 8 Bible&quot; ....not one talks about bluetooth. I have googled til im <i><b>blue</b></i> and still no howto explains&nbsp; what to do. The Refgerence on the web are broken and not maintained. ive searched forums. I have a blue tooth headset PLT 510 and a MS bluetooth notebook mouse. I can connect the mouse and use it. I can&nbsp; PAIR and Coonnect the headset in FC8 but NO SOUND!. Ive tried to Find the BTSCO&nbsp; download but BLues wiki says &quot;this is no longer required&quot; Dont&nbsp; try FC 9 either...iterrors immediatley with bluetooth. somehow they broke what was working from FC8. <br /><br />Why do i want to use bluetooth...SKYPE! i like talking over the internet to friends and family {VoIP}. FC9 has too many bugs to upgrade to it as yet.&nbsp; Ubuntu works too hard to stop Su with APARMor. It hides&nbsp; all root user processes. Also i reduce the number of dongles on my Lenovo Laptop&nbsp; using bluetooth. I can use a keyboard mouse and headset using one dongle&nbsp; as opposed to 3 connections. <br /><br />I would dearly love&nbsp; if someone who has gotten their bluetooth headset to work&nbsp; could tell me the steps i could follow to get mine working!<br /><br />BlueZ website refers to outdated links and it&#039;s howto&nbsp; refers to another site which is no longer maintain. I am confident that the bluetooth portion is actually working but requires some work around to&nbsp; link it with my sound processes. { I hear&nbsp; the headset beep after pairing and connecting} but when i go into any menu to select the bluetooth heads set as the sound output&nbsp; the only options available are&nbsp; the on board chipsets for the mother board... therre isn&#039;t a &quot;bluetooth&quot; selection&nbsp; from any drop down menu. What&nbsp; do i do from here?</div>
