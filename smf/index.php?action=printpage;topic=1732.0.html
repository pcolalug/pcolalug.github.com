					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The broken english seems too much of a caricature of what a rooskie chick would type, vs. reality. Methinks its a joke to get some drama on this board?<br /><br />Admin should see where the IP originated from to confirm. Don't think she'd be smart enough to use an IP proxy to hide herself, eh? If she was, then this is a joke.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The IP address of the poster was 195.14.51.246, which is registered to: &nbsp;rektorgstr-gw.corbina.net<br /><br />Not sure about the first part of that address, but http://www.corbina.net appears to be the website of a Russian telecom corportation.<br /><br />I'm guessing the post is not from a spammer. &nbsp;Looks like Pensacola is becoming a world player! &nbsp;Interesting.<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Moved from Swap Meet (:lol:). Locked this date (spam). <br /><br />Didn't delete because its too amusing. Mods, please keep an eye out for this ip/poster. If it becomes a problem, we should probably have the domain banned.</div>
