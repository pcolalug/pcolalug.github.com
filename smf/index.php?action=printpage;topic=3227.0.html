					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It&#039;s nearly time again for elections to our Steering Committee.<br /><br />Due to terribly low attendance last meeting, we opted to delay the elections by one month.<br /><br />As is tradition, I have cut-and-pasted the important details below. :D<br /><br />It&#039;s time again to nominate Steering Committee members for the coming year.&nbsp; Please post your nominations in this thread.&nbsp; Be sure to include name (and/or forum name) and the position you wish to nominate this person for.&nbsp; If you have multiple nominations, please include them in a single post.<br /><br />The Steering Committee is a core group of LUG members who are responsible for the day-to-day running of P&#039;cola LUG. The positions are:<br /><br />1. President - responsible for inter-organizational contacts, organizing events, and presides over meetings.&nbsp; Incumbent:&nbsp; Brett Hoff<br /><br />2. Vice President - primary assistant to the President and responsible for President&#039;s duties, should the President be unavailable.&nbsp; &nbsp;Incumbent:&nbsp; <br /><br />3. Secretary - responsible for intra-organizational communication, posting meeting notes, summaries, and announcements. Also responsible for forwarding/replying to email sent to info@pcolalug.org.&nbsp; &nbsp;Incumbent:&nbsp; Ian Barr (green_dragon37)<br /><br />4. Librarian - responsible for the P&#039;cola LUG library administration, &quot;review book&quot; ordering and distribution, and primary contact for O&#039;Reilly.&nbsp; Incumbent: Lloyd Randall (lloydr)<br /><br />Two other positions - Webmaster and SysAdmin - are also part of the Steering Committee and are appointed by same. These folks are responsible for the maintenance of our website and hardware assets respectively.&nbsp; These two positions can be held by a single person.&nbsp; Incumbent (both positions):&nbsp; Lloyd Randall (lloydr)<br />&nbsp;<br />If you are nominated, please carefully consider your acceptance. These positions take some time, effort, and commitment on your part. It&#039;s not much, really, but please consider your other obligations. Talk to some of the current and/or former Committee members if you have specific questions about a position.&nbsp; Once you have decided to accept (or decline) the nomination, please post a reply in this thread to that effect!<br /><br />Nominations will be accepted from now until the 19th of October, and at the meeting itself. We will vote as a group at the October meeting (10/20). You must be present at the September meeting to vote, but you don&#039;t have to be there to win.&nbsp; The new committee should have all appointed positions filled and officially assume its duties on November 1st.<br /><br />Please take a minute to consider who you&#039;d like to see elected to help our LUG function and grow, and PLEASE set aside some time to make it to the September meeting to VOTE!<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Ian<br />PcolaLUG Sec&#039;y</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><br /><br />&nbsp; Thank you Charles for the nomination and for your confidence in me. It would be an honor to serve on the steering committee, however I may not be able to devote as much time to the position as the job requires. My wife and I expect to be traveling a bit this next year,two or three months in south Florida and south Texas during the winter and then next summer we expect to be RV&#039;ing across Canada and Alaska for three months. If the LUG wants and can accept a part-time VP then I will serve and devote as much time as I can.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Harold</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The VP is mainly a backup guy and a great person to get ideas from and bounce ideas off of. I have no problems with your terms!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">&nbsp; It appears to me the Pensacola LUG is in the last throes of death. What I can see is that attendance at meetings has fallen off, forum postings has decreased and a general lack of interest is quite apparent. Now this doesn&#039;t really have to be if we can get the right people to serve on the steering committee, people that want to see linux expanded, people that will learn/ teach/ share linux and advance the FOSS philosophy. Time after time I have seen new people join the LUG and drop out after only one or maybe two meetings. I don&#039;t know what the remedy is to our problem nor can I accurately identify the problem, but I do feel certain that we have in our LUG the people that can and will identify and apply remedies. Now I don&#039;t personally know enough about our members to know their workload nor their dedication, so I don&#039;t feel that I can make accurate knowledgeable nominations, yet I do know that the steering committee does not have to be all linux gurus. New members, old members, all members qualify if they have the desire to serve, therefore I ask everyone interested to consider nominating themselves for the positions they feel they are able to fill. As dpeach said in one of his posts last year concerning nominations: come on guys it&#039;s time to step up to the plate(not a direct quote).----Harold<br /><br />edit:If you don&#039;t want to nominate yourself, PM me and I will do the nominating for you--Harold</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">One of the things that has &quot;cooled the jets&quot; in the forms is that the IRC channel has been quite active. Some days/weeks it is more lively than others, but it is quite the treasure trove of instant help.<br /><br />I think the forums are still a very vital part of the LUG though. Those of us active in the IRC channel (#pcolalug on freenode) need to make a more conscientious effort to get new information flowing through the forums.<br /><br />I second the comment about nominating yourself (or am I saying it again and WoodyHarlold is seconding it?) Now that I have been away for three years, it is hard to know who is active and who is not. If you are a new comer to the group, don&#039;t feel at all shy about stepping up and taking some responsibility. I know it is always easier to think that someone who has been around longer should take the reigns. That is what a vote is for. Nominate yourself, or you friend and then allow the members to make the decision as to whether you should have the position or not. We like new people.<br /><br />I do know who is active in the IRC channel and the forums. I second the nominations for green_dragon and WoodyHarold for those positions (or vice-versa).<br /><br />I will throw in Crowe and djoed_pcola into the mix somewhere.<br /><br />I know we will weather this time. It seems that we have lost a couple of vocal people here recently. But we can overcome this.</div>
