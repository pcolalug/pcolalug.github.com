					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m using Office 2000.  So far, Word, Excel, and Powerpoint seem to work, although I haven&#039;t tried any serious testing.  Access launches, but I get a message that IE is required.  Since IE is installed and works, I may have to try some registry tweaking to get Access to work.<br /><br />I mainly just wanted to try out wine, because I&#039;m too lazy to climb a mountain.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The reason I need to run Office, mainly Word, is that me and my wife have to deal with MS only institutions. In my consulting, I occasionally write documentation and most of the time, they like their deliverables in Word format so they can edit the document to add notes or what have you. The problem with using OO.o and Abiword is that they still haven&#039;t gotten the formatting 100% for everything. I&#039;m making money off of this document and I want to look as professional as possible and having bad formatting is only going to make me look bad. <br /><br />The second instance is goes along the same lines. Michelle and I are both in school. I can get away most of the time with turning in PDFs, so I&#039;m good for the most part. Michelle has to submit her papers as .doc&#039;s and once again, formatting plays a big part, because she&#039;s getting a grade. The other thing is that Word has grammar check. I know, a crutch, but it&#039;s good for catching small grammatical errors. It saves her time while writing and also helps her avoid the simple errors such as double words and improper capitalization that cost points when grading. I don&#039;t know of any F/OSS product that boasts a spelling checker AND a grammar checker.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">In my opinion, being able to run Windows apps in Linux:<br /><br />* Adds more credibility to Linux and to open source software<br />* Provides a possible migration path to Linux without switching applications<br />* Some web-sites won&#039;t work correctly unless your browser is IE<br />* Like Rugmonster mentioned, creating documents such as Word for exchanging with others<br />* Is Neat</div>

I think it would make the folks that rely more heavily on proprietary software to ask why they should use more F/OSS. If the F/OSS isn&#039;t good enough for the OS community, why should they use it? Another thing to add is that your have to jump through some pretty high hoops to get most of apps to run correctly under Wine and stability is usually lacking as well as major features. That is a major detractor for most business and casual users.<br /><br />Wine isn&#039;t really an option for my need for Office since I prefer 2003 over 2000 and that is not supported. I&#039;ll stick with VMWare for now.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think the credibility is added just by the fact that F/OSS developers have made native WIN32 binary programs run in Linux to begin with.  The wine developers deserve some credit for what they have accomplished so far.</div>
