					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Nobody seems to like debian, and with good reason.<br /><br />It's release cycle is so slow that you're at least a year behind other distros. &nbsp;Old kernels (2.2), old X (stil using Xfree 3?). &nbsp;Very unfriendly to use. &nbsp;The package system is a nitemare. &nbsp;(It's actually very powerful and can do nice things like resolve dependency issues) but it's a PITA to use.<br /><br />Of course that's just my opinion, I could be wrong...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Apparently others agree with you. I don't think anyone in the group has ever mentioned it. Come to think of it, why do we have a section for Debian in our forums?<br /><br />On the other hand, it seems that several companies jumping into Linux and wanting to build on another distro are choosing Debian. The old, now defunct, Corel Linux (which I personally loved and hated to see go by the wayside), as well as Lindows (http://www.lindows.com), and Xandros (http://www.xandros.org) are all built on Debian. Of course, Xandros is just Corel Linux that was picked up by another company. There may be others that are based on Debian.<br /><br />Why choose Debian to build upon? Maybe it is because Debian isn't doing anything with it, so others felt sorry for the distro and wanted to give it a chance to make it to market.<br /><br />And what about Caldera? Are they still around? Let me check their website...<br /><br />Well after checking in with Caldera.com (http://www.caldera.com), I have found out that they are still around...sorta. They changed their name in Augyst to SCO Group. OK, honestly, before reading this, how many people knew that Caldera changed their name?<br /><br />Man, do I pick loosers or what? They were my favorite distro after Corel.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">1. I knew about SCO. Sheesh, don't you people read Slashdot (http://www.slashdot.org)? &nbsp;8) <br /><br />2. I'm not sure what you guys have been reading, but Debian (http://www.debian.org) is one of the more popular distros among the geek set. &nbsp;Its apt is cool, and it is rock-stable. &nbsp;It is also free (http://www.debian.org/intro/free). Debian's focus is that stability, that's why you don't see the latest - greatest kernels and such. &quot;Debian was meant to be carefully and conscientiously put together, and to be maintained and supported with similar care.&quot; (http://www.debian.org/intro/about#history) They are slow and methodical in their development. &nbsp;If you have to have a server with no-question stability running Linux, Deb is a great way to go.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Really, any of the distros can do what any of the other ones can. After all, we are all running Linux. Shouldn't we be able to get any distro set up like any other? <br /><br />So I guess my point is, why do I have to pull my hair out to install Debian, when I can install Mandrake, or any of the &quot;easier to install&quot; distros. Then I can configure it with the same tools, pull out the unecessary bloat, and have just as good of a system. I guess the only thing there is, the tools are default in Deb, and there is no pulling bloat out. But if it takes me 3 days to get the thing to recognize my hardware, couldn't I have installed Mandrake in 1 hour and spent the next day pulling out the unwanteds.<br /><br />I am not against Debian, though I think if they do not try to keep up, then they will lose what market share they have.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I did some quick Googleing on this and found a couple of links that out line the advantages of Debian over other Linux distros. The links are below. The main items. for me, seem to be:<br /><br />1. Upgrading the system looks like it's done in the background. Rebooting and installing via CD is not necessary. You don't even have to go into single user mode.<br /><br />2. Packages seem to be easier to install than on other distros.<br /><br />The links:<br /><br />Link1 (http://datamining.csiro.au/debian/book/Advantages_Debian.html)<br /><br />Link2 (http://www.infodrom.org/Debian/doc/advantages.html)<br /><br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Gentoo:<br /><br />I've tried Gentoo. &nbsp;It was a pain to install, but it was a good way to blow a weekend. &nbsp;I did the &quot;Build the entire system from scratch&quot; style. &nbsp;Not too terrible considering I have a decent system, but I spent 90% of my time compiling.<br /><br />You'll learn a lot about linux doing this, but if you're (un)lucky enough to screw something up, it's a lot harder to start over. &nbsp;(That's why I like other distro's, stick the install CD in, and in 20 minutes you've got a freshly installed working system).<br /><br />I wasn't geeky enough to adopt Gentoo for more than a week :(<br /><br />Anybody here used FreeBSD? &nbsp;I really like it (and was using it over Linux until I got my NVidia GeForce 3, had to switch back to linux because there aren't any good drivers for BSD yet). &nbsp;My favorite feature is, you pop in the install CD, it installs in like 5 minutes, then you exit the installer and you're using your system (without reboots), kinda nice.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I definitely agree with Crowe here. &nbsp;I used to use Slackware religiously (up until version 4.0). &nbsp;Then I switched to Redhat. &nbsp;I was completely lost, things were setup differently, a lot of the things I was used to manually setting up now had to be done via redhat's Setup program. <br /><br />After using RedHat for a while, I find myself completely lost in slackware. &nbsp;But I have come to really like the convenience RPM gives you (although it is frightening to most users who are first confronted with it). <br /><br />Using Debian was completely different than slackware or RedHat. &nbsp;apt is powerful, and shares a lot of features with RPM, but wasn't the same to use. &nbsp;<br /><br />Then FreeBSD, it's sort of a take on the old way of doing things. &nbsp;You switch to /usr/ports, find the program you want to install (such as networking/gaim or whatever). &nbsp;In the directory you type &quot;make install&quot;, it downloads the latest sources, compiles and installs it. &nbsp;I think if you do a &quot;make uninstall&quot; it will remove it. &nbsp;Also if you're missing any dependencies it will put that build on hold, go get the missing software, then continue. &nbsp;Pretty nice. &nbsp;Not really a &quot;package manager&quot;, but solves the problem in it's own way.<br /><br />I guess the reason I use RedHat / Mandrake primarily is that it's what I&quot;m used to and feel most comfortable with. &nbsp;A friend of mine uses Slackware, and won't even consider switching to RH/MDK (although I nag him about it every chance I get). &nbsp;<br /><br />RedHat and MDK did make life a little difficult for us lately though. &nbsp;They've both recently reorganized their distributions, switched up / changed configuration programs, locations. &nbsp;So it's become a bit of a learning curve lately, but not bad.<br /><br />I guess it's a move to make it more friendly to the average user, but RH (at least in Gnome) has taken the terminal program off thte quick-launch toolbar and burried it in the &quot;System Tools&quot; menu. &nbsp;<br /><br />Nick</div>
