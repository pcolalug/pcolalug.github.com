					Post by: <b>FlexBaud</b> on <b>April 13, 2007, 12:46:19 am</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey Guys,<br /><br />I am a 22 year old male that lives in Pensacola and currently commutes to Gulf Shores for work. It&#039;s 30 miles one way everyday. I currently make $12 an hour and get free health insurance. I provide IT Support for FTTH (Fiber to the home) I work with a lot of command like based systems.<br /><br />Anyway, I have been unable to find any decent jobs in Pensacola that pay as much as I do now. I&#039;ve tried several different companies. I have been using computers for the past 15 years or so and know a lot. I&#039;ve setup my own Trixbox (PBX) System at home as well as a HTTP Server, Etc. <br /><br />Any suggestions for decent IT Job&#039;s in Pensacola? I don&#039;t have any college behind me, but I do have a lot of experience. <br /><br />Thanks Guys.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">There are several jobs in the area; unfortunately everyone is looking for a bachelor&#039;s minimum for most positions.&nbsp; Do you have any .NET experience?&nbsp; That can land you a job in a heartbeat for more than $12/hr even without the degree.&nbsp; Are you looking to do anything other than networking?&nbsp; Say programming?&nbsp; </div>

I don&#039;t have .NET. I have very little programming experience. I have worked on some SQL Databases before as well as some minor Java and HTML, but that&#039;s it. I dislike programming very much and try to keep away from it. I tried starting a web design bussiness a couple years ago and it started to take off, but I just couldn&#039;t take all the code... I always had headaches, etc. It&#039;s just not my thing.<br /><br />So to answer your question, I have no .NET Experience at all. I&#039;m pretty open when it comes to computers... I just don&#039;t want programming.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Wow there are jobs here in Pensacola in the admin/network world. You basically have to wait for somebody to quit or die.<br />On the other hand programming jobs can be had quite quickly...especially if you had some .net exp. *wink*.<br />Most IT jobs in the area are not even listed locally...Guess we local&#039;s have gotten a bad wrap.<br />When I was coming back to pensacola I checked Monster and ending up getting a programming job <br />on Saufley field with DANTES. All I could pass as a word of wisdom is to check some of the job listing<br />sites and filter for our area. and start gathering a list of local companies that would need your skill sets.<br />Even thou they are not advertising locally they may have posted out, or outsourcing, or looking to fill a postion shortly.<br />So start blanketing the area with resumes. Can&#039;t hurt!<br />Hope that helps<br /><br />some ideas to get you started. techsoft, apps river, escambia river utility,gulf power, any health or law firm, Plugit...<br />Just to name a few......<br />And to your 30 miles each way.............when I was living in New Hampshire it was a 2 hour each way for a crummy job for little pay that I loved :) </div>
