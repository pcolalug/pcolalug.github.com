					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well guys looks like my friends over at PJC were very gracious this year and sponsored two SANS community events this year.<br />I did not get to make the GCIH Incident handler in January but just got registered for the GPEN certified ethical hacker from SAN. in March.<br />I will be taking the cert for the GCIH though probably in July. Since I did not get the boot camp will take some studying on my part.<br />Both are great certs to have as the GCIH is listed as number #1 in the country and the GCFA that I already have is listed as #3. <br /><br />If you ever get the chance be sure and try to get one of these great boot-camps you will walk away a much better prepared IT person than you were going in.<br /><br />I will give updates to this thread as the boot-camp and test draw closer.<br /><br />Also on a side note some of you know that I went to take the RHCE RedHat Certified eng twice about 18 months ago.<br />The first attempt was a wash with me only getting the RHCT RedHat certified Technician, But after 18 months of communicating with them about there result challenge. Which they do not have. I may be getting my RHCE very soon. I missed by three points on the last exam but I felt that was wrong as I completed all the questions and knew 2 to be more likely than not wrong. I offered to fly anywhere in the country and have a RHAX architect quiz me face to face. But no go.<br />Finally they have agreed that there might have not been a completely competent person to run the test and may be eligible to get my cert. Should no soon.<br /></div>
