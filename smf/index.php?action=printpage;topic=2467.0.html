					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">As far as bellsouth monitoring downloading, I'm not really sure how much they do that really. I know quite a few people with bellsouth dsl and as far as I can remember, bellsouth doesn't monitor anymore than the other residential cable and dsl isp's.<br /><br />If you want dsl and want an isp who doesn't monitor traffic and allows servers, I'd recommend Megapath business dsl.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I went to the Bellsouth web site and found they do and if they think your downloading something your not suppose to they may stop your service. I just don't want to guess what I can and can not download. Maybe bit torrent is the answer in that case.<br />My son has Cox and says they are great also. I just don't need cable TV.<br />So telephone, ISP and long distance is all I need.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks everyone….</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Most residential ISP's will &quot;reserve the right to monitor you activity&quot; when in fact they rarely ever do unless there is a need. Keep in mind that every P2P software has a legitimate use somewhere in it. On that same token, most residential internet service will have a no server clause. This is just to make the majority of people who want to run a server buy a business account. <br /><br />In the six year I've had cable internet from Mediacom, Roadrunner, Cox and now Knology, they all had monitoring and no-server clauses. Do I feel like they've looked into what I've downloaded or what servers (SSH/HTTPS/FTP) I'm running? Not at all. As long as you are downloading kiddie porn and giving law enforcement some reason to look into your activities, monitoring is going to be a non-issue. If you are so concerned about monitoring (which is going to happen to you anywhere a server keeps logs), then use some anonymizing software. <br /><br />So really, it comes down to what's the best bang for the buck. I recommend cable internet and then get a Voice over IP phone. Doesn't matter from who as long as you aren't going to pay more than $25/month before taxes and at that price you should be getting unlimited long distance. Total internet/phone cost should be no more than $75/month. HTHs</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Usually, they will give you a $10 or so a month break if you have basic cable. That is usually around $7 a month, so you get the standard broadcast channels and the weather channel. The downside of DSL with BellSouth is that you have to at least pay for a phone line, which after taxes is about $30 or more, plus the slower speed that you are paying for. Total, you wind up spending more for DSL and slower speeds. The only reason I could see getting DSL is if you could get Speakeasy.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">not sure where u live, but I'm moving to Gulf Breeze in a few days, and signed up w. Mediacom. they have a special right now $29/month for the 1st 12 mos, no contract. bellsouth wanted me to get a pots line + i think it was $79/month for the full blown DSL vs. that DSL lite thing, which would have pushed it to like $100+. i've never had a problem w. mediacom in the past (my folks had it when they were living there before Ivan) and it was about as reliable as Cox. they all have their momentary/temporary outages, no matter who you use.<br /><br />i have vonage (the voip adapter worked great out in the field when we ran from ivan by the way) and will just continue on my $24.99/month service w. them (unlimited long distance/local calls outbound to the united states and canada, just that one flat rate) so I'll be good to go for local/ld calling @ home. tmobile for the cell/gprs.<br /><br />good luck! i've heard from some of the techs that dsl seems to be better for counterstrike. i've been playing counterstrike source for 3 months now on cox. my ping times &nbsp;vary depending on what server i'm hitting, so either way should be ok. we'll see what happens when i cut over to mediacom in a few weeks (they can't set me up till the 16th of this month, not too terrible imho).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I on the other hand had Mediacom and we had several outages. We had problems with the modem they gave us. And we also have had trouble with getting them out to fix the problems and I even have a couple of friends that work there, one in the call center for broadband and one that does the installs. <br /><br />We switched to Bellsouth DSL. We even opted for the midgrade plan(1.5M down and 256K up, I think) which was slower than the Mediacom plan(3M down) but I have yet to see a noticeable difference. I have had one outage for what was about 4 hours. I haven't had to deal with customer service yet though. I know Bellsouth had a long waiting list for new service a few months ago due to Ivan so I don't know if that is still true now. My dad works for Bellsouth so we were able to skip the waiting list. It also gets us a discount, but I think without the discount the pricing was comparable.<br /><br />With both Mediacom and Bellsouth I have downloaded lots of Linux ISOs. I have run Bittorrent and Limewire, though I rarely use either since this machine is slow and has no sound card. My brother on the other hand uses Limewire a lot. He also plays Galaxies, World of Warcraft, and Enemy Territory endlessly. I have even run various servers, though never constantly. So far I have never heard from either of them, though one month we had our download speed capped after I downloaded almost ever Linux ISO known to man(this was with Mediacom). It wasn't unbearably slow though and only lasted about a week. <br /><br />Anyways, hope my one data point helps. Good luck finding the right one for you.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I tried MCi and AT&amp;T for phone service and they don't service Pace/Milton area!!!! So I got local service form Bell South. I tried Yahoo DSL and it said it was unavailable to my number? I think I might save the money and just climb on my roof and yell to whoever I need??? Still looking...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Alan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yahoo DSL is for SBC customers (that's Southwestern Bell). NW Florida's baby bell is BellSouth. Product, prices, etc will more than likely be nearly the same as they are probably very similar products.<br /><br />But why get a landline? You are paying so much more than you need to. For what you are going to spend on local and long distance phone service and DSL, you could get cable with voip and a cell phone. Plus, with the voip, you will get unlimited long distance. To get that through a traditional provider is usually at least $50 a month. Let's break that down...<br /><br />Plain Jane Phone Line, no long distance... $30/month after taxes<br />DSL Service... $42.95 for 1.5M Down/256k Up from Bellsouth (plus taxes) (also think about the year or two contract)<br />Unlimited Long Distance through BellSouth...$24.99 (plus taxes)<br /><br />Total for Landline = ~$100/month after taxes<br /><br />Or, you can go with cable...<br />Cable Internet...$40 for somewhere between 2 and 4Mbps down/256k to 384k up. Cox even has a plan for $55 for a 5/768 plan. I had that in OKC and I believe it is available in Pensacola. God was that fast.<br />VoIP Service...$27 unlimited local and long distance anywhere you plug in the VoIP box. Plus Canada and Mexico (so you can call dpeach).<br /><br />Total for Cable/VoIP = ~$70<br /><br />$30 a month is $360 a year. To me, that's money that could have been spent another way.<br /><br />But, it's up to you how you want to do it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have to attest that the VoIP phone service is tremendous. I have a much slower connection than what these guys are talking about and it works quite well for me.<br /><br />Do some looking around here on the forums about VoIP. I think there are 2 threads of particular interest. One of the members even has his VoIP plugged into the phone system of his house and has no land-line, but all the phone jacks work through the VoIP. How cool is that?!</div>
