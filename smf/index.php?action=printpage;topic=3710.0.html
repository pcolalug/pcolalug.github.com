					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello, everybody!<br /><br />A few of us were reminiscing about past LUG meet ups on IRC and one fond memory was Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory. After an of hour nostalgia talk, we reinstalled RTCW:ET, played it for a bit and instantly became hooked again.<br /><br />Now I know we can&#039;t be the only ones who enjoy a good, local game; so for now, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I&#039;m posting to see if there&#039;s any interest in trying to make this happen again in a future meet or special event.</span> <br /><br /><br />Here are a few pics taken from 4(?) year old demos(LARGE images):<br /><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><li>http://imgur.com/81OT7.jpg</li><li>http://imgur.com/aoQbD.jpg</li><li>http://imgur.com/GkJjK.jpg</li><li>http://imgur.com/GQRJF.jpg</li></ul><span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 1.3em;">*Disregard the black sky. I turned off sky effects for my config.</span><br /><br /><b>This game is free to download.</b> Please try it out and feel free to post your thoughts.<br />Game download (for Linux): http://www.fileshack.com/file.x?fid=2743<br />2.60b patch: http://linux.softpedia.com/get/GAMES-ENTERTAINMENT/FPS/Wolfenstein-Enemy-Territory-3948.shtml<br /><br /><br />I end this post with my favorite frag vid from a great European player: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__4sg-83yG4<br /><br /><br /></div>

I remember when I first joined this community my intentions were just to play games. However, my interest casually grew and I started to experiment(with green_dragon37 planting the seed).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I might be able to run ET on this notebook. Never could on any of my other ones, but worth a try. Of course I would be playing remotely and therefore have lag and get killed easily. But what is different about that than any other time I play?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I got ET running well on my notebook. Any ideas as to whether we will get something going like this?<br /><br />Does anyone have any recommended servers? Because I don&#039;t have the million new mods installed, sometimes it takes me an hour just to grab the mods so I can play on a server. Pretty frustrating.</div>

All the servers I frequented years ago are long gone. <br /><br />It takes an hour to grab mods? You can&#039;t just connect and spend a couple minutes downloading all the maps? I take this time to go grab a soda or check my email.</div>
