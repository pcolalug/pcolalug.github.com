					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi there!<br /><br />I've never joined a Linux Users' Group before but always thought about it. &nbsp;I just moved here several weeks ago, and I don't know anyone here yet. &nbsp;It does't help that I am somewhat anti-social even though you may never guess that from how I speak in this writing. &nbsp;I've performed systems and network administration for hte last several years for several lousy webhosting companies (of which I an deliberately neglecting to mention.) &nbsp;I've been a Linux user since around 1998 me thinks, mostly with Redhat-like RPM-based distros. &nbsp;Redhat and Mandrake, for example. &nbsp;I've tried Gentoo, and I didnt have the patience to wait till tomorrow to use a system that I wanted installed and configured yesterday. I've also diddled with Caldera and Debian I just never had a feel for them... &nbsp;I've even administered about 200 FreeBSD servers at one point (not quite Linux, but they worked.) &nbsp;I still prefer the penguin. &nbsp;Then one day I stubled across ArchLinux, and its pacman package manager. &nbsp;Its hard to get me to use anything since then.... and I've actually rebuilt and repackaged the ArchLinux system to my own specifications into my own distro. &nbsp;Currently its an unnamed system, but I will deploy it along with my up-and-coming webhosting company to which I have also co-designed the entire user and administrative control panels from the ground up. &nbsp;Its been a lot of work, but d**n it was an experience! &nbsp; I've since installed my distro on my desktop, and have not booted a Windows partition in ages. :lol: <br /><br />So about me, ya know. &nbsp;Im a prankster, a joker, and someone that will do anything for a laugh to make others enjoy whatever situation they may be experiencing. &nbsp;I'm creative and a performer, and enjoy to just do or say something of which was never thought of before, or nobody ever would take the time to think of or do. &nbsp;I work on cars, motorcycles, TVs, and pretty much anything that has a mechanical or electronic function. &nbsp;People usually call me Duckie, but this has earned me the title &quot;Dr Duckie&quot; by some. &nbsp;Cheesie, I know, lol.<br /><br />So anyways, &nbsp;I will try to make it to a LAN party or a meeting, or a demonstration or something, someday soon. &nbsp;If you hear someone heckling in the group with a thick NJ accent, and making others laugh, its probably me!<br /><br />Side note: &nbsp;For those of you familiar with this... I'll never use another ATI Radeon card in a linux system again! &nbsp;Bleh!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome to the group, TheDuck! &nbsp;Glad to have you aboard. &nbsp;We have an interesting group of folks around here, of all skill levels. &nbsp;The forums are fairly active, and some of us hang out in #pcolalug on Freenode if you do any IRC'ing...<br /><br />Hope to meet you soon at a meeting, and again welcome!<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thank-you very much, perhaps I will plug the IRC room later this evening. &nbsp;I've been an MIRC addict for years, I often wish it was ported to Linux, maybe someday. &nbsp;Otherwise I will fire it up with WINE later and I'll see you guys there! :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey now! &nbsp;I would, but then I'd have to rewrite all of the scripts that I had written for MIRC. &nbsp;I kinda like em, and I'm quite happy with them. &nbsp;It was a lot of work, and something I'm not ready to part with. &nbsp; :P</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Post some of your scripts here and let us help you translate them into a usable format for irssi or xchat.<br /><br />Or, if you are good at writing code, recruit some code monkeys to help make a Linux port of MIRC.</div>
