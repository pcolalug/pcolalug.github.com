					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've been using Gnome 2.2 in Slackware 8.1 for about a week now. &nbsp;And so far I really like it. &nbsp;Besides some clean-up to the general user interface, they've made some enhancements to gnome that I really like.<br /><br />They've cleaned up the fonts and themes. &nbsp;Especially making them useful on hi resolution displays. &nbsp;Previously I was pretty much maxed out at 1024x768. &nbsp;But now I can use it 1280x1024 and 1600x1200 without problems.<br /><br />Speed. &nbsp;As they continue to optimize and tweak gnome, nautilus, mozilla. &nbsp;The apps and desktop are getting faster and better. &nbsp;Still stable as ever, no crashes so far.<br /><br />Handy features, like CD Recording are built right into the desktop. &nbsp;Open the file browser and browse to &quot;burn:///&quot;. &nbsp;Drag and drop files you want to put on CD, arrange them however you like. &nbsp;Then click on the Applications menu and select &quot;Burn CD&quot;. &nbsp;(You have the option of writing the files to CD or creating an ISO image file). &nbsp;So simple.<br /><br />They've made the move (I think RedHat started it) to abstract program names. &nbsp;Instead of &quot;OpenOffice Writer&quot; you have &quot;Word Processor&quot;. &nbsp;Instead of GAIM you have &quot;Instant Messenger&quot;. &nbsp;Insetad of &quot;Mozilla&quot; it's just &quot;Web Browser&quot;. &nbsp;Again, this is a feature I really like and personally the way I think desktops should present software.<br /><br />They've integrated more apps which I had never used before but really like. &nbsp;A media player called Totem which plays back audio, video, vcd's, and DVD's. &nbsp;(Also XMMS when you need just a straight audio player). &nbsp;<br /><br />They've included everything needed for most people to be productive, and left out multiple programs. &nbsp;(You get one web browser, not Mozilla, Netscape4, Netscape7, Galeon, and Phoenix). &nbsp;<br /><br />The Gnome2 integration with recent versions of Wine is nice. &nbsp;(I think it works with KDE too but I can't say for certain since I don't use it). &nbsp;When I install a windows program in wine, it gets integrated into my start menu and windows desktop shortcuts show up on my gnome desktop.<br /><br />Nautilus desktop handles mounted volumes correctly. &nbsp;When I mount a filesystem (CD, Zip Disk, Floppy, etc), an icon to the device appear on my desktop. &nbsp;It gives you an easy GUI based way to browse the device, unmount, eject, format, all the other standard stuff.<br /><br />There's now (I never noticed one before) a &quot;Recent Documents&quot; menu integrated into the menu system which tracks files opened through nautilus and allows easy access.<br /><br />Back to apps, I'll list the basic included apps here, this is how they're structured in the menu.<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"><br />Applications<br />&nbsp;

As I have mentioned before, it is a sad state of affairs when the command line to do a task is easier than its GUI counterpart.* This has been the case with the CD software that I have used in Linux.<br /><br />To have CD burning implemented like this is great.<br /><br />*I realize that some things are much quicker in the command line. But CD burning (http://www.pcolalug.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=172) is not a simple task. The GUI should be much easier than the command line in this job. I have found it to be much easier at the command line though.</div>
