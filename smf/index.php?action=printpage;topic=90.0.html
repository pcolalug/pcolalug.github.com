					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Has anyone seen Lindows (http://www.lindows.com) yet? It is supposed to be the first fruition of the Xandros distro (http://news.zdnet.co.uk/story/0,,t269-s2104565,00.html). Who is Xandros (http://xandros.com)? They are the company that bought out Corel Linux about this time last year. I followed the Corel Linux and was very impressed and would have liked to see it continue. Typical of Corel though, they spread themselves too thin and get themselves in financial trouble. Unfortunately, they will probably do it again. But that is another subject.<br /><br />Xandros is based on Corel Linux 3.0 (which was never released). Lindows is based on Xandros. But what I am wondering is are Xandros and Lindows actually related? Or are they a Red Hat/Mandrake relationship of days gone by?</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">From all that I have seen, Xandros and Lindows do have a sort of RedHat/Mandrake relationship, the difference being that they are being developed concurrently (Xandros, BTW, is based on Debian (http://www.debian.org)). There were some interviews (http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2002-08-10-001-26-IN-DT-SW) recently with Xandros' CEO. &nbsp;They have had some rocky times getting things going, but we should see this distro before the year is out. &nbsp;I just wish their site (http://www.xandros.com) was more informative! &nbsp;It was even more sparse than that for months.<br /><br />As for Lindows, I find myself in the &quot;I'll believe it when I see it&quot; camp. &nbsp;What with the circus that was MP3.com, I think folks are leary of this new venture. As we said in the 80's, don't believe the hype.[/url]</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Lindows (http://www.lindows.com) supposedly has a product on the market if they are selling at WalMart.com (http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product_listing.gsp?cat=96356&amp;dept=3944&amp;path=0%3A3944%3A3951%3A41937%3A86796%3A96356). &nbsp;But according to Lindows site, I don't see anything to indicate that they actually have anything going.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok, I stand corrected. &nbsp;It does exist as a distrobution, but appearently one you can only get through walmart.com or by becoming an &quot;insider&quot; at a cost of $US99. &nbsp;Is it just me, or is *charging* folks to beta test your product distasteful? Brilliant marketing, if its working, though. &nbsp;&quot;Hey you can't see our super cool software. &nbsp;Oh, alright, but you have to give me $$&quot;<br /><br />Either way, I'm still holding my breath about all of this &quot;run windows and linux programs seamlessly on one machine&quot; business. &nbsp;I've used wine and wineX and both leave a bit to be desired. &nbsp;If they've managed some sort of grand breakthrough, then I surely hope that they share it with the folks working on wine.</div>

I think you should run Linux and Linux programs or Windows and Windows programs. Trying to get Linux to play nice with windows apps is IMHO a waste of time. If you need the windows capability, my solution is just dual boot or find the Linux app that does what you want.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Good point. &nbsp;This does bring up an interesting question, though. &nbsp;What do you folks say to people when they tell you &quot;I'd try it, but I really need MS Office&quot;? Do you point them to products like Open/Star/KOffice or wine or a bit of both? &nbsp;i personally point to Linux-native alternatives and leave wine out of it, or I sugguest a dual boot until there is an alternative for what they are using now.</div>

The problem with pointing a newbie to something like wine is that if it doesn't go right the first time for everything, they will blame it on Linux and drop Linux. Most likely they will not come back anytime soon.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just don't like MS Office. I have never chosen to use it at home. I have had to use it at work and do not like it at all. I think that if people used other products they would find that they don't have to be married to MS Office. I would encourage them to use OpenOffice.org. You can even get it in a Windows version so that they can practice using it before they commit to Linux.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Steve - that's my fear exactly. &nbsp;I've had too many seemingly simple apps show me a splash screen then die quietly under wine to want to show it to someone that I am trying to &quot;sell&quot; on Linux.<br /><br />David - I agree that OO is a great suite, but I think that it has all of the UI foibles that MSOffice does and then some. &nbsp;Don't get me wrong, I like it and use it at home and work (don't tell the admins ;)). &nbsp;I've been tempted lately to try Hancom Office (http://en.hancom.com/index.html), since I got my wife a Zaurus for her birthday. It comes with an embedded edition of Hancom and it is really nice. <br /><br />The buzz these days seems to be that OSS needs to spend some time on UI issues and not spend so much time copying the MS look and feel. This is still the time where we as a community can experiment without jepordizing any sort of market share on the Desktop, since its so low. Personally, I'd like to see more work in gestures vis a vis Opera (http://www.opera.com) or even Black and White (http://blackandwhite.ea.com/).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am not sure why people think that MS has the best UI on the market. Just because they have the majority of the market share does not mean that their UI is that great. <br /><br />I do understand software providers wanting to &quot;copy&quot; them. If that is what you know, it makes it comfortable to make the switch. On the other hand, if there is a better way, why don't we educate the people that we are trying to convert. It is not like learning how to use a word processor is that difficult. <br /><br />I could see a secretary that spends his/her whole day in MS Office having some issues with converting to another suite. But if you are talking about the majority of users, it is guys that just need to type a letter on occasion. How difficult is that to figure out. If the interface is better, then it should be relatively easy.<br /><br />I have sold my soul to Lotus WordPro for 6 years. I know it and use it better than most people using MS Office. But I have had no problems using OpenOffice.org. I am using it as my main word processor now in both operating systems.<br /><br />Just my 3 cents.<br /><br />David<br /><br />BTW, how did we progress to this from a discussion on Lindows?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for posting that review (http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,3973,587751,00.asp) of Lindows. Wow! You really must read their earlier review (http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,3973,491621,00.asp) to get the context.<br /><br />Curious though, why does a company like ExtremeTech, use asp on their site? They are obviously Linux/Unix biased. Why not use php?<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi all this is my first post. I have seen screen shots of lindows and I have heard from my cousin who uses it. I don't like what I hear. You have buy yearly membership with lindows just to get updates. Sounds kinda like what microsoft wanted with .net and I didn't like corel either. I could never get it to install; it would always crash on reboot and this was on a new machine.</div>
