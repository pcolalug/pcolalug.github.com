					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm thinking of investing in some new video stuff when I get home. Namely, I'm looking at buying a second 19&quot; CRT monitor. I have been looking around and have heard some good things about the Optiquest Q95 and it is pretty darn cheap at around $200. I was wondering if anyone has and suggestions as I would like to stay under $300. The lower the better, but I don't want to skimp on quality. I want something comparable to my VX900 from Gateway. It isn't the best monitor in the world (not a flat CRT and only 76Hz at 1600x1200), but I like it and it does the job for me. At the same time, though, I don't want to go way over in quality either since I'll have to be looking at both sitting right next to each other. I have even debated buying a second VX900 to avoid that issue completely. <br /><br />Also, I'm looking to buy two new video cards. One for my main system and then one for the secondary. The secondary doesn't have an AGP slot due to it being a crap integrated AGP chipset that doesn't behave in X. I'm thinking about throwing down $50 for a GF2 MX PCI for that system. In my main system I'm thinking about going with a Geforce4 TI4200. Considering my system is slightly dated being a P3 550, do you guys think putting that card in there will help me out significantly? I'm not a hardcore gamer and don't expect to play Doom3, I just want to be able to play the newer MMORPGs, namely Dark Age of Camelot (no linux client...yeah yeah yeah). <br /><br />Thanks guys!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, since there is now a Best Buy in town, the sky's the limit. Just check out Best Buy's web site and then when you get here you can pick it up at the store.<br /><br />(This, in no way, has anything to do with the fact that I work part time at Best Buy...:))<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Since the subject has been brought up, what do ya'll think about the GF2 MX200 card for $50 that Rugmonster has mentioned? I like the price. I would like to get something in the NVidia family without going overboard in price or cheaping out. I have $50 to go towards the project of a new vid card. <br /><br />I know that the MX200 is a PCI card (at least the ones I have seen). I have an AGP slot. Am I shorting myself by looking at a PCI card when I have AGP available to me? I know that was the thinking a few years ago, but is that still true?<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I did a lot of research on the web before making my purchase. &nbsp;And I couldn't be happier. &nbsp;The nvidia GeForce 3 Ti 500 64mb AGP. &nbsp;(I think you can get it 128mb also if you want). &nbsp;Best performance for the price, outperforms most of the GeForce 4 cards. &nbsp;I got mine for less than $100 with shipping, so shop around and you're sure to find one. &nbsp;This was a huge performance boost over my previous card, a Matrox Millenium G400 Dual Head 32mb AGP. &nbsp;<br /><br />Just a general shopping tip, with the Nvidia's you want to stay away from the MX series of cards, because they are generally low-end cards and don't perform as well as you would expect. &nbsp;The Ti are the way to go. &nbsp;A GeForce 3 Ti will outperform a GeForce 4 MX. &nbsp;(A GeForce 4 MX from what I've read is an overclocked GeForce 2 card). &nbsp;If you can afford a GeForce 4 Ti that might be a good way to go too, but last I checked they were a few hundred dollars for the nice ones.<br /><br />Let me know what you end up with.<br /><br />Also, on your monitor. &nbsp;When my previous 19&quot; monitor died, I went to WalMart and picked up a KDS Visual Sensation 19&quot; monitor (Not the X-Flat model). &nbsp;Spent $130, and it works great! &nbsp;This was probably 6 months ago, I don't know what the current pricing / models they offer are, but you mignt wanna check in to them.<br /><br />Nick<br />imnes@go.com</div>

Am I shorting myself by looking at a PCI card when I have AGP available to me?</div><br /><br />No and Yes. Every card since the TNT2 has been primarily available as an AGP card. I am having a harder time finding a GF2 in PCI than anything. And yes, you will be shorting yourself in getting a PCI when you have AGP available. You will also be shorting yourself by getting any MX card. They are better than my TNT2, but it definitely isn't great by any measure. Here (http://www6.tomshardware.com/graphic/20021218/vgacharts-06.html) is a benchmark comparison of most all modern video cards. Those are benchmarks on high end systems, but there is an update coming for slower systems soon.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: imnes</div><div class="quote">The Ti are the way to go. A GeForce 3 Ti will outperform a GeForce 4 MX. (A GeForce 4 MX from what I've read is an overclocked GeForce 2 card). If you can afford a GeForce 4 Ti that might be a good way to go too, but last I checked they were a few hundred dollars for the nice ones. </div><br /><br />Yes all around. The TI is the newer convention of naming. They originally only had the Geforce3, but they did some tweaking with the clock speeds and released two different models, one better and one worse, but not as bad as an MX. The only differences between the different models within the same chipset (ex Geforce 4 TI, Geforce3 and Geforce3 TI), with the exception of the GF4 MX which is really a overclocked Geforce 2 chipset, is the clockspeed of the GPU and the memory.<br /><br />As far as buying a new video card, I would wait until the next Nvidia chipset comes out, the GeforceFX. Then it will be affordable to buy a Geforce 4 TI 4600. Right now, you can get a GF4 TI 4200 64MB for a little over $120 (check pricewatch), especially if you don't want Video In/Out, TV-Out and 8x AGP. Those with older motherboards won't be able to take advantage of 8X AGP anyhow, so it isn't drastically needed. I am expecting the GeforceFX to come out in the typical spring release schedule that Nvidia likes to keep, but prices will continue to drop until then.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I remembered this thread from last month, and thought I'd post an update. &nbsp;Got a new GeForce4 Ti 4200 (64Mb AGP) yesterday (at Best Buy!), and must say that I'm <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">very</span></b> pleased with the results. &nbsp;This was an upgrade from a GeForce2 MX400, and things are very noticeably smoother/faster (in openGL games like RTCW, Tux, UT2k3). &nbsp;Anyway, very much worth the $149 (after rebate), and I highly recommend this card. &nbsp;It's not the absolute best you can get, but value for the dollar seems unbeatable to me.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Not to steal Best Buy's thunder...but if you head over to www.pricewatch.com, you can find the TI4200 64MB for under $125 (which includes shipping in most cases). Great if you don't mind waiting a couple of days.</div>
