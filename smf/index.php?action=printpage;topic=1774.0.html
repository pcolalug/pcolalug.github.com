					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Im looking into getting a new motherboard, cpu, and case<br />Want something that can handle games, with out killing my checkbook.<br /><br />don't care if its p4 or amd. just want it to support more than 4 ide devices, have usb 2, and maybe come with firewire. other than that just something decent. <br /><br />if anyone has seen any good deals let me know please.<br /><br />Was also looking into some kind of 1u fileserver getup. Could really use some suggetions on that one. Needs to have 10/100/1000 if possible, and i have to be able to upgrade or add hard drives to it. But all it will be doing is servering files, locked up in a closet<br /><br />if anyone know a good &quot;check it out site&quot; or a &quot;configurator site&quot; just point me that way. <br /><br />Thanks All</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I use newegg for that sort of stuff, i'll get some links to some good mobos you might want.Since it will be in a room locked, it's not going to have anybody playing games on it, right? :P This one has built in video.. <br />here's an intel motherboard,always been solid for me, some people might not say the same. :) $109,supports 4 ide devices and 2 serial ata.<br />http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=13-121-189&amp;depa=1<br />And since it doesn't have firewire, here's some cheapo card-$11<br />http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=15-106-002&amp;depa=1<br />I'll let you pick the case.. :)<br />http://www.newegg.com/app/manufact.asp?catalog=7&amp;DEPA=1</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">No, that's ok. &nbsp;Seawolf has me freaked about TigerDirect and this deal a bit from some reading he has done on dslreports. &nbsp;Since one of the rebates, the $50 one, is still good after tomorrow, I might recommend that folks wait for me to get mine in and see what kind of experience I get.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I received my Soyo barebones kit today and overall I am very happy with it. &nbsp;I simply installed a spare Duron 1Ghz and low profile heatsink and fan onto the motherboard.<br /><br />The Good:<br />+ Cool looking case. &nbsp;The handle is really quite neat.<br />+ Everything worked right off the bat with Knoppix 3.4<br /><br />The So-so:<br />+ The case, keyboard, cdrom, mouse, etc. all &quot;felt&quot; cheap.<br /><br />The Ugly:<br />- Don't expect to put in a monster Thermaltake heatsink and fan as the power supply sits over the CPU. &nbsp;If I didn't have a server grade low profile heatsink and fan, I would have been forced to wait. &nbsp;AMD tends to run hot so it requires cooling.<br /><br />So, I have been playing with Knoppix on this box because I didn't install a hard drive in it yet and may not. &nbsp;I bought this $20 barebones kit to play with Linux on the desktop a bit more and for me, it's working great after 8 hours or so. &nbsp;I picked up 512MB of PC2700 ram from Bestbuy this weekend for $59 after a $40 rebate. &nbsp;I don't remember how much the duron or the heatsink costs, but they were spares, so it was real cheap for me. &nbsp; The box will cost me about $100, plus or minus a few bucks.<br /><br />I would say that if you are building a spare, for fun box, and forgive me if I go off thread for a moment, it was worth the &quot;risk.&quot; &nbsp;If you are building a desktop to do day-in and day-out work on, I would look for better quality parts across the board. &nbsp;I may change my mind if this beast runs well over the next couple of months though...<br /><br />Scott</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">How do you like the Durons? I may be helping a friend put together a computer soon and she has already said she just wants to have something to go online and write emails with. She's definitely not the type to play games on her system other than solitaire.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Personally, I like the Duron; however, if you are starting from scratch, you really should weigh Intel v. AMD for your situation. &nbsp;Just remember to be careful about cooling as AMD chips tend to run hotter.<br /><br />Scott</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: scottstancil</div><div class="quote">...be careful about cooling as AMD chips tend to run hotter</div><br /><br />I have an Athlon XP 2500+ and an Athlon64 3200+ and have had zero heat problems. I'm not overclocking them, but the 2500+ is in a Shuttle case. The stock coolers, from my experience are fine as long as you are running the processor as it is rated. From what I've seen, the P4s run just as hot as the new Athlons. I don't see the big deal with running an aftermarket fan/heatsink. Why would a manufacturer sell a processor with a substandard cooling solution and warantee it?<br /><br /><br />EDIT: What the.... Steve agreeing with me?!<br /><br />\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: scottstancil</div><div class="quote">Just remember to be careful about cooling as AMD chips tend to run hotter.Scott</div><br /><br />They may run a little hotter but the Max temperature is 85 degrees Celcius or 185 degrees Farenheit. So, there's still a lot of room to play.<br /><br />Anyway, I've never had a problem with AMDs overheating or Intels for that matter.<br /><br />Steve</div>
