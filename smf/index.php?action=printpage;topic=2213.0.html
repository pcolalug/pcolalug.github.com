					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Argh, windows is stupid.<br /><br />I've spent the greater part of an afternoon fixing what windows messed up. &nbsp;When I installed win2k, not only did it insanely goof up my planned partiton layout, but it installed the bootloader on my backup fat32 partiton.<br /><br />Anyway, that fat32 partition has been around for a while, and it had some bad sectors on it, so I was gona reformat it. &nbsp;Well, I reformat it, windows apparently distroyed it's own bootloader in the process. &nbsp;Did I mention I can't even install linux (or lilo which could have possibly saved me) thanks to the partition layout?<br /><br />So anyway, I fire up my copy of knoppix, backup my important stuff to my fat32 partion, and slice and dice the huge monstrosity that is my windows partition. &nbsp;I've installed installed slackware right now. &nbsp;I guess I *might* reinstall w2k, (I've got a good game of civ3 going). &nbsp;Ugh windows, how I loathe thee.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You may already know this, but.... if you must have both on your computer, it's always best to install Windows first, and then any Linux distros you want. &nbsp;The Linux bootloaders can handle Windows, but not the other way around.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That's the standard advice, <br /><br />But I prefer to install linux before windows, just to make sure space is reserved for linux. &nbsp;I know how to go back and fix lilo later. &nbsp;Excentric? &nbsp;Maybe, but it lets windows no its place, 2nd to linux :^)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: Brent</div><div class="quote">But I prefer to install linux before windows, just to make sure space is reserved for linux.</div><br /><br />Not sure I follow that reasoning... &nbsp;Making a 10G partition from within the W2K installer (on an 80G drive for example), and installing Windows into it, doesn't reserve any space for Linux? &nbsp;To me, it would seem to leave 70G...<br /><br />Anyway, it's your system. &nbsp;Good luck.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You would think...<br /><br />Something about that backup fat32 partition makes the installer act wierd.<br /><br />For instance, I just got through reinstalling win2k. &nbsp;It installed the ntldr on the backup C: partition again, and from the look of things if also has a rather large logical partition, which sucked up the space I had left &nbsp;to extend my backup partition later on. &nbsp;In any case, I'd rather have windows trying to work around linux, than linux trying to work around windows...</div>
