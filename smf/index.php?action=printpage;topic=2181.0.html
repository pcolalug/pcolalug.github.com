					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: Brent</div><div class="quote">Not often i say this about apple products... But ....wow.</div><br />I say it all the time. I am very impressed with their stuff, but until now, I would have never considered actually thinking about buying one.<br /><br />This is a great little product. I am not in the market, but maybe someday in the future. I have seen similar PCs, but have never heard anything good about them. I cannot imagine Apple making a flop out of this (though there was one they made that seriously unimpressed me about 8 years ago).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/<br /><br />Simple MP3 player. You can get 512 or 1 GB model. It is like a USB drive. Plug it in and it synchs for you. You can have it randomly synch a bunch of songs off of your computer, or give it a particular playlist. It can also play randomly so that you never know which song is coming next. Charges via the USB when you are plugged in for synching.<br /><br />$99 for the 512.<br /><br />Does not even weigh an ounce (.78 ). Goes 12 hours on a charge and has an adaptor to add 2 AAA batteries to it.<br /><br />Pretty cool. Not 40GB, but since I have had only one CD ripped to my Palm as my MP3 player for the last year, I think 512 is sufficiently large enough for me.</div>
