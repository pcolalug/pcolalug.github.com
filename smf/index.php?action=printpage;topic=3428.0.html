					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><b>Date</b><br />Meeting date will be the normal Thursday night. December 18 is the day.<br /><br /><b>Presentation</b><br />We did not discuss a specific presentation tonight. If someone wants to volunteer for a presentation, you have a month to put it together.<br /><br /><b>Legacy Gift Exchange</b><br />We would like everyone to bring a gift to exchange next month. Please do not spend any money on this. The idea is to bring some archaic piece of hardware that you have lying around and exchange it for some equally useless hardware from someone else. The older, and more obscure, the better.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sorry guys, but I can&#039;t make this one.&nbsp; Just got an invitation today to a ceremony I have to attend, and it&#039;s on Thursday, December 18, at 6 pm.&nbsp; Sucks.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">We had 6 people attending the meeting last night: OneAdvent, oddball, TheDuck, dmnhunter, lloydr, and me.&nbsp; The Legacy Gifts were pretty decent, there was a box of EDO/SDO RAM, some Amiga parts, and a couple of ancient hard drives.&nbsp; Given the proximity to the holidays, I would say that it was a fair meeting, though I hope to see more at our next meeting!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thank you to green_dragon37 for covering for us this month. Both the President and Vice could not make it to the meeting. I was busy eating an early Christmas dinner with the family in Orlando. I hated missing the meeting, but enjoyed being with the family for a week.</div>
