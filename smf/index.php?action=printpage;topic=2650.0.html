					Title: <b>New ATI Radeon Drivers Released</b><br />

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just happened to notice that ATI released a new version of their drivers for the Radeon 8500 series and higher. Here are the new features to this release. Also, I can&#039;t confirm whether or not the 2.6.13 kernel is supported with this release. I&#039;m happy to see an new X Server config tool and Xinerama support. I am anxious to see how Xinerama compares to the standard &quot;Big Desktop&quot; of the old drivers.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: 8.18.6 Release Notes</div><div class="quote"><b>Dynamic Clock Gating</b><br /><br />The Linux 8.18.6 software driver provides dynamic clock gating. This feature allows the supported graphics cards to deactivate components when they are not being used.<br /><br /><b>Enhanced Support for OpenGL Development</b><br /><br />The Linux 8.18.6 software driver provides enhanced support for OpenGL development. The driver now installs the glATI.h header file allowing for OpenGL developers to access the advanced functionality found on ATI&#039;s hardware platform.<br /><br /><b>Dual Link Monitor Support</b><br /><br />The Linux 8.18.6 software driver now provides support for dual link monitors for ATI graphics cards that have dual link DVI connectors.<br /><br /><b>Xinerama Support</b><br /><br />The Linux 8.18.6 software driver now provides Xinerama extension support for big desktop configurations.<br /><br /><b>New X Server Configuration Utility</b><br /><br />The Linux 8.18.6 software driver now provides a new X Server configuration utility known as aticonfig. This allows for configuration of ATI devices via a command line interface. </div></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">wow, excellent timing too..... got this laptop with a ati radeon mobility 9700 that is just calling for linux and I remember the fight that the ati support put up in the past with the mobility 9000 laptop. <br /><br />I noticed sometime or another they added a .run installer compared to just the rpm/deb&#039;s they offered that I had to extract and use...... that&#039;s atleast a nice addition whenever they added it.<br /><br />also, I&#039;ve read that people are using it with 2.6.13.x fine more out of a luck than official support, so atleast that is good news.<br /><br />one thing that is weird though. looking at the mobility products support, it doesn&#039;t mention the mobility 9700. it says 9600 and 9800 along with the x#00 line, but no mention of the 9700. I remember back when I setup the mobility 9000 it officially wasn&#039;t supported like all of the mobility line, so it just thought it was a radeon 9000. Any ideas if this will also be the case for the 9700? I&#039;m fine with it just seeing it as a radeon 9700 over a mobility radeon 9700 lol just as long as it&#039;ll game ;)</div>
