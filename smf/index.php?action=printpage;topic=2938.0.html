I personally use Debian for my desktop. If you&#039;ve never used original Debian, or haven&#039;t in a while, perhaps it&#039;s time to give it another go. Help with the testing and bugsquashing if you have time.<br /><br />Despite what people say, Debian is not that far outdated. I am running Debian Unstable (SID) and I have newer stuff than the last release of Ubuntu Dapper Drake. Why? Because every release of Ubuntu is based off of what&#039;s in Unstable and modified appropriately. It looks like the next release of Debian Stable is going to be right up there with freshness. Also, the new leader of the foundation has said that he wants the project to pick up its pace and that things have moved too slowly in the past. I know in SID, things have moved forward at a surprising clip compared to a year ago, and it all filters down from there.</div>
