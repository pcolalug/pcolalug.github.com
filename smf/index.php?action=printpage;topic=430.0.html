					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Alrighty folks...I have some internal struggles. When I go home, I am debating on whether to keep my cable or get DSL. My cable is freakin' fast (2.4 to 3.0 Mb/s down with good servers and around 240 kb/s upload). &nbsp;DSL is slightly more expensive, but most providers don't block ports. I want to run my own servers and such and don't mind dynamic IPs, but don't know if I am willing to lose my bandwidth. Now would be the perfect time to switch since my bandwidth here is so much crap and all. Suggestions?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I switched from Cable to DSL just because cable was such a pain for me, and service / support was a joke. &nbsp;DSL has just worked. &nbsp;It's kinda quircky to use in Linux, but works fine. &nbsp;I just haven't put in the time to get it working 100% yet. &nbsp;Every few days I have to get it to re-establish the connection, I think maybe my IP address is getting changed by my router isn't seeing it or something.<br /><br />As far as bandwidth I don't have any hard numbers to give you, so this is just my perception of it. &nbsp;I think my per-connection speed went down (I seem to average around 170k/s download speeds per file), but my overal speed is still good (Adding more simultaneous downloads doesn't seem to slow each other down). &nbsp;<br /><br />I dunno if that makes any sense, but it's what I seem to have going on.<br /><br />I'll run a cnet bandwidth speed test and see what I get on that...<br />http://webservices.cnet.com/bandwidth/<br /><br />I ran it a few times and I got an average speed of 740kbps. &nbsp;<br /><br />Hope that helps,<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey,<br />I haven't had DSL service here in Pensacola, but currently have Cox cable and like it a lot. &nbsp;I had DSL last year where I used to live (Seattle), and it was nowhere near as fast or as reliable as this cable has been. &nbsp;I have had ZERO problems with Cox, and routinely get 200Kb/sec download speeds. &nbsp;I am convinced that it's faster than DSL, and is around $15 cheaper per month to boot.<br />Another bandwidth checker to try (I think it's more accurate than the cnet one above) is:<br />http://www.bandwidthplace.com/speedtest/<br />Regards,<br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I'm not so much asking about DSL vs. Cable in Pensacola. I live in Oklahoma City, OK when I'm actaully in the states, so I'm asking in general.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm using Cox Cable here in P'cola. I ran the CNET bandwidth tester about 6 times and got numbers ranging from 1280Kbps - 2468Kbps.<br /><br />With that said, My brother uses DSL while I use cable. I find that I normally get a better download speed than he does. However, this is going to depend on your DSL and cable provider for your area. Cox cable has been very good in the P'cola area about segmenting their connections so they don't get overloaded.<br /><br />Steve4</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I used DSL for a year and a half and just had to switch to cable (DSL provider went belly up). I have not run speed tests, but the cable seems a bit snappier. I use dial-up most of the time (travel for work), so anything is better than when I am on the road.<br /><br />DSL allowed me to host my site from home. The cable provider here in town does not allow this. I am sure this will vary for your location. <br /><br />As much as I liked my DSL, cable seems to be a better deal (cheaper, faster). But if having a static IP is important, then you will have to find out which will offer that in your area.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks guys. I will have to see what is available when I get home. I am beginning to lean more toward DSL. I have had cable everywhere I have lived for the past two years, but as the various worms have gone around and cable providers started putting up firewalls, I have become more and more unhappy. Cox in OKC is great for speed, but they block all kinds of ports including 25 and 80. I also just reread my ToS and found that I'm not authorized to run any &quot;servers&quot;. I guess those ftpd, ssh/telnet and web server(running on 81) aren't supposed to be there. Darn. I guess that means one more thing I have to shop for when I get home.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here's the scoop on my Cox connection.<br /><br />I pay $45/month (They just raised it from $40/month)<br />I don't pay anything to lease the modem. (It runs less than $100 to buy a modem. If you lease it at $15/month then you bought it after having your connection only 7 months.)<br />I get consistantly good connection rates. I don't host a server at home as I don't have a need to. However, Cox does have very good rates for a dedicated line and IP to host a server.<br /><br />I can't speak for other Cable/DSL providers but from what I've seen of my brothers Bellsouth DSL and my Cox cable, I'll stick with Cable.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok, let me just second that Mediacom in SRC has mega-lossy customer service. On the technical side, they'll go to change a router and you're down for a day and a half (this seems to happen, BTW, every three months or so). I didn't know about the inability to run Linux/Win2k. Guess I'll have to switch to FreeBSD! ;)<br /><br />Hitechwizard uses Cox in EC, and they have been pretty good. He's got a commercial-grade account and they went out of their way to ensure service during his recent move (they didn't succeed, but they made it right in the end).<br /><br />As for performance, I have no complaints with cable and have never tried DSL. I am on the horns of a delima myself, since I want to set the network back up at the house, but Mediacom's going to charge me an extra $5 per additional box. I can go with their low-end commercial account for about $70 a month or so. Alternatively, I can go with BellSouth or some other DSL provider.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't need Mediacom's tech support all that much, and, other than the 3 month cycle of outages, the connections are solid and relatively speedy. Also, I don't really want to hastle with PPoE and all of that nightmare. So it looks like I'll be sticking with cable for now.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here is a copy of my script. I just read through it again and made some tweaks.

The above isn't the most secure and the syntax is from memory, but you get the idea.<br />As for slipping this by Mediacom, their level 4 routers sniff packets for unique mac addresses, and I don't feel like mac replication everytime I add a node to the network. They also will block servers and the like unless you have a comercial account. Oh, and the $5 per isn't for additional ips.

I'm of the school of thought that the function of an ISP is to merely provide you with a connection. What you do with that connection is your business. ISP's fall under the common carrier laws making it very hard for folks to sue them for the actions of their customers. I'm so glad I'm not in Milton anymore.
