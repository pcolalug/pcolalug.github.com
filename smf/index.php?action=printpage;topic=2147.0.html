					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've got a Linksys BEFCMU10 ver 2 (http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?grid=34&amp;scid=29&amp;prid=592) and have my WRT54G stacked on top of it. From time to time, the modem will overheat. I know we have some folks in here who know electronics and such, so what would you recommend for a fix for this heat problem? It looks like I may be able to mount a shallow fan in place of the holes on top, but I don't know where I would get power from for the fan. Also, I'm not the best with soldering iron, but know some people who are at work. What do you guys think?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just pour a half pint of 10W-40 in there every month or 10,000 web pages (whichever comes first).<br /><br />Outside of that there are a couple of things you can do. The fan idea would probably work, and a little probing around with a multimeter (carefully) would probably give you a good idea as to where to tap in. Probably the best is just as &nbsp;the power comes into the box. It will not be fused, but it will also be before you get into any other systems.<br /><br />But, probably the easiest, and best thing is to have nothing on the modem that is also generating heat. Having above and below the modem open will cut down on the heat. All those holes were designed for a reason.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The obvious answer is to not have them stacked, and place them side by side, if you have the room to do so. &nbsp;A thin fan between them would probably solve it, but as you say, power could be tricky. &nbsp;Most fans used in computer cases run on 12v DC, and there likely isn't a good place to &quot;tap&quot; into that in the router or cable modem.<br /><br />Perhaps you could get a small (4 inch or so) oscillating type fan that runs on AC power, and stand it nearby to blow across the modem/router...?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would sit them side by side, but that takes up a good deal of desk real estate. An external fan would again take up desk real estate and potentially be loud. I'm thinking something like a 60mm fan in place of the holes. And these were designed to stack on top of one another such as I have them, but the design unfortunately doesn't allow for enough air flow. <br /><br />I just noticed that there is a set of holes on the bottom of both the router and the modem... Perhaps an exhaust fan on the top of the modem would do the trick...<br /><br />One thing that I have noticed in the past is if a fan is underpowered, it simply won't turn as fast. Since I don't need a roaring beast of a fan, this would be fine. I may take the modem into work next week and get someone to help me with a multimeter. If nothing else, I have a spare cable modem just in case.<br /><br />What do you guys think about putting some cold cathode lights in there too? Maybe replace the entire top of the case with clear plexiglass and paint some of the internals with blacklight reactive paint? &nbsp;:lol:</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Or you could make some standoffs to make the devices sit higher off the desk and each other. I know it is cool to see them stacked like that (they have such a sweet design), but the heat will eventually do permanant damage. Just do something simple like a small block of wood cut for the feet that would raise it up 1/4&quot; to 1/2&quot;. I don't think you are going to need much.<br /><br />And you are right, a 12v fan powered at 9v would just run a little slower.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Might sound odd but try reversing them. &nbsp;If you've got the wireless router on top of the modem and the modem's got an issue try it the other way around...the router might deal with the heat better as Linksys products seem to be made to be stacked.<br /><br /><br />Another alternative to the fan idea (good idea, I might add, I even added in a CPU fan into my car to cool down my stereo on hot days, pretty slick really) is to come up with a new method of stacking them. &nbsp;Such as, if you can get some spare wood you can fashion up a miniature shelf so they're at least four inches apart.<br /><br /><br />Since we're on the topic I'm always amazed by Linksys networking products (for home anyway). &nbsp;They have no internal fans as far as I can tell, no method of cooling, only have a couple of tiny holes on the top, run for years on end, and never seem to overheat. &nbsp;Amazing.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">friend of mine did this with his linksys WRT54G after he boosted the output power by a large amount and it started to run hot, he just drilled out the holes on the bottom, cut a 70x70mm hole in the top and mounted one of the 70mm TMD(tip magnetic drive fan, no electric motor in the middle) that moved i believe about 40cfm and found a 12v dc power brick that matched the amount of current he needed for the fan<br />http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=35-106-601&amp;depa=0<br />I wasn't able to find a TMD fan by itself, but i found the cheapest heatsink that came with the fan lol<br /><br />i think other people have used those coolermaster or thermaltake 80mm squirrel cage blower fans as they can push a little more pressure into the small casing<br />http://www.frozencpu.com/fan-81.html<br />http://www.frozencpu.com/fan-80.html<br /><br />another option is find one of them crappy &lt;80w powersupplies made for like p2 celeron budget machines that is a microsized atx powersupply and use it for a power source heh<br /><br />also, i dug this up from the dslreports linksys forum about adding a fan to a wrt54g, should be pretty similiar to your cable modem except for the internals<br />http://www.dslreports.com/forum/remark,11133636?hilite=fan<br />they soldered the fan to the connections where the power brick connected to the wrt54g so basically the fan draws directly from the powersupply<br /><br />about same thing, but on the BEFSR41v2<br />http://www.dslreports.com/forum/remark,8135142~mode=flat<br />they used the same way for wiring in the fan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I had a similar proplem with some of my gear, And although I did eventually repair the fan in the mean time I placed a piece of alum plate stock between them it acts like a heat shield between the two and displaces a lot of heat to the surronding enviroment.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay. I looked at the posts on those other forums and decided that this project won't be as involved as I thought it would be. Rather than going with the huge 20mm thick fans, I went with a 60x60x10mm fan. Here (http://www.coolbidnow.com/th60qucafanr.html) is a link and below a picture. I think I can mount the sucker about half in and half out of the case if I cut out the space for it. I'll figure out some way to hold it there...perhaps fabricate something to allow it to rest on. I'll plan to have it blow down into the box as that is what most people in the other forums says works the best.<br /><br />(http://store1.yimg.com/I/coolbidnow_1818_13208529.jpg)<br /><br />I'll post an article with pictures once it's done.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">One thing to keep in mind. The power supply for you modem is designed to provide enough current to run the modem. If you start adding devices like a fan to it, you may draw more current than the power supply can handle and burn up the power supply. I'd try to power the fan from an external source.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think Steve has a valid point, though I would agree that it is not a problem. If I remember my electronics well enough (I can look this up if we need to debate it), if you have a power supply with the proper voltage, but higher amperage, then you could do this safely. The higher amperage would take care of the extra drain that the fan would require. But not be damaging to the unit like higher voltage would be (though there is an amazing tolerance in these components for higher or lower voltage. But the device is made to run at a particular voltage to maintain proper timing.)<br /><br />In my feeble mind this is borne out by my truck. The amperage of the battery is much more than my dome lamp needs to operate. But yet the extra amperage does not destroy the lamp with too much current.<br /><br />I would think that finding yourself a proper voltage power supply with a higher amperage will eliminate all concerns. Though, I am not concerned with the current set-up (mainly because it ain't mine to worry about).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You're on the right track, dpeach... &nbsp;A power supply (or a truck battery) doesn't &quot;have&quot; any amperage to it. &nbsp;It supplies voltage, and is &quot;capable&quot; of supplying a certain amount of current flow (amperage). &nbsp;If it's rated for 1 amp, it can supply a maximum of 1 amp of current flow. &nbsp;But the amount of *actual* current flow is determined by the load on the power supply (in your example the dome light). &nbsp;The load wants a certain amount of amperage, and if the power supply can provide it, it will. &nbsp;In your example, the dome light doesn't ask for much, and the battery can easily supply it.<br /><br />Think of current flow as being &quot;pulled&quot; from the power supply in the amount needed by the load, not &quot;pushed&quot; out of the power supply to the load. &nbsp;As long as you don't try to pull more current out of it than it's capable of supplying, it won't burn up...<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I finally got my fans in. First, I must say this wasn't nearly as hard as I thought it would be. Let me apologize if you are on a 56k connection since there are a lot of pictures here.<br /><br />Below is the new fan. It's a Thermaltake 60x60x10mm fan meant for processor cooling.<br /><br />(http://members.cox.net/dgivens4/router/newfan.jpg)<br /><br />The hardest part was figuring out how to get the router open. It uses a screwless design, but I did void my warrantee in opening it. Basically, you tilt the front blue section down and it releases a latch on the inside and the front slides off. From there, you slide the bottom black shell forward and the top comes off. You can then unscrew a single screw holding the PCB in place and then slide the board back and free it from the bottom shell.<br /><br />(http://members.cox.net/dgivens4/router/opened.jpg)<br /><br />Here you can see where I soldered the fan's power in. The two pins in the middle directly above the DC input in the picture.<br /><br />(http://members.cox.net/dgivens4/router/power.jpg)<br /><br />Here, I used a Dremel to cut out a hole in the top where the ventilation holes were before just large enough for the fan to be held in place. Since there is plenty of room inside the case, I could set the fan down inside the case a good bit.<br /><br />(http://members.cox.net/dgivens4/router/insidefan.jpg)<br /><br />After mounting the fan, I soldered the power leads and used some superglue to make sure the fan stayed in place. I then reassembled the router.<br /><br />(http://members.cox.net/dgivens4/router/nogrill.jpg)<br /><br />Since there is a cat in the house who is quite curious, I decided to put a fan grill on the top of the router. I think it also makes for a much cleaner appearance.<br /><br />(http://members.cox.net/dgivens4/router/grill.jpg)<br /><br />And here you see it stacked on top of my modem, which will get similar treatment this weekend.<br /><br />(http://members.cox.net/dgivens4/router/finishedrouter.jpg)<br /><br />So, in about an hour, I setup a fan running off of the router's power to cool the internals blowing air into the case. The fan is pretty quiet, but I'm beginning to wonder if I should have put a rheostat or power switch in it. It's a quiet purr, so I'm not too worried about it. All seems stable so far. If I have a problem, I'll be sure to let you guys know.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Looks very nice. I think the grill really adds to the overall tidiness of the project. Great work. I am not having problems with my Linksys router, but my SpeedStream DSL modem is extremely hot. I will have to get it up on stilts or work on sticking a fan on it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just got the modem done. I think the air flowing through from the router on top was sufficient to cool both, so I installed a slide switch on the back of the modem to control the fan. I think I'm going to open the router up and give it similar treatment. What's two more solder points?</div>
