					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">For those who care, Nvidia came out with a new driver, version 6106 (yesterday). &nbsp;I have been using an older one (version 4496) because it was stable and worked well, but I figured it was time to update...<br /><br />Well, it installed OK, but at first running it failed with an error about permissions. &nbsp;Turned out to be a PAM issue which is well documented in the README. &nbsp;After some editing and chmod's/chown's it was working in 3D mode. &nbsp;However, I noticed a decrease in OpenGL framerates as compared to the 4496 driver (from 3450 fps to 3330 fps). &nbsp;This is measured using the &quot;glxgears&quot; test, which I know isn't completely accurate but is fine for direct comparison between two drivers.<br /><br />So, I'm back with the 4496 driver, and not concerned with things. &nbsp;As I said, this driver has always been solid for me, and have seen lots of people complaining about the newer versions (5336 and 5328). &nbsp;Of course, I'm still using a 2.4.x kernel too, so you people with 2.6.x may have a different experience. &nbsp;In fact, I'd be interested to hear what your results are if you try it.<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I was running the 5336 drivers before and now am running the latest 6106...with 2.6 kernel without 4K stacks enabled, i did notice a decrease in performance overall, but isnt noticeable even in ut2004 unless i start turning up &nbsp;antialiasing and such..... ut2004 is still playable nonetheless since it still runs smooth as silk, the only way i could really tell the difference in performance was running the ut2004 benchmarks<br /><br />since the new nvidia driver supports 4K stacks in the kernel, i will give that a shot in the next day or 2 and see if i get any sort of performance boost....some people have said their system is slightly more responsive but hard to notice without benchmarking or on a lowend machine</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Oh that's cool (4k stack support) I'll load Fedora 2 for another try again tonight and see how it goes.<br /><br />Are any other kernels using 4K stacks or just the redhat / fedora stuff?<br /><br />BTW: Those of you who ordered the SuSE software kit, should be showing up soon, people at work have started receiving theirs.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think all of the -mm kernels were 4k stack-only for a time. I haven't run one in a while so I don't know about 2.6.7-mmX.</div>
