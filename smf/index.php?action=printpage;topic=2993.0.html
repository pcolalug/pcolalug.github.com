					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">http://students.uwf.edu/wbh1/Screenshot.png (note, I&#039;ve customized this desktop)<br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />In the past, I&#039;ve tried many a linux distro, however each has eventually driven me back to slackware.&nbsp; My roomie patrick lent me his laptop.&nbsp; I had to find a distro that was both feature rich, and lightwieght.&nbsp; Enter xubuntu!&nbsp; I&#039;m *deeply* impressed with this distro.&nbsp; Here are my reasons why, in no particular order.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Apt-get --&nbsp; For the 98% of the time it works, apt-get is truely awesome.&nbsp; It is by far the best package management system I have ever used.&nbsp; I love the way you can hook into debian unstable&#039;s repositories and download anything you need in a flash.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Plug and Play --&nbsp; While not unique to linux in general, the plug and play capibilities of xubuntu rivals that of its much bigger breatheren.&nbsp; For example, drivers for my network card (atheros based) were loaded during install.&nbsp; I know it&#039;s not that hard to compile madwifi drivers, but being able to point and click your way to a complete wireless setup in mere minutes is nice.&nbsp; Also, many features of the laptop such as suspend/resume work nicely (that&#039;s a first I&#039;ve seen).<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Bundled software -- Or lack there of.&nbsp; I love stand alone software that requires neither gnome or kde to run.&nbsp; For example, you have the standard desktop fare such as firefox, thunderbird and gaim, as well as xfce exclusives such as thundar (a drop in replacement for gnome&#039;s nautilus file browser), and an xfce movie player that handles most codecs well (I hate ubuntu&#039;s policy of tightly bundling gstreamer).<br /><br />If you&#039;re on the lookout for a feature rich featherwieght, you owe it to yourself to at least try xubuntu.&nbsp; Do yourself a favor though, and grab the alternate install disks.&nbsp; Not only will they install well on machines with less than 192mb of ram, it also has install options for LTSP, raid setup, and automated deployment.<br /><br />Note, dan has brought another flavor called fluxbuntu to my attention.&nbsp; However, it does not seem to be supported well, in fact the site is down right now.<br /></div>
