					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Firefox Hacks<br />Nigel McFarlane<br />First Edition March 2005 <br />Series: Hacks <br />ISBN: 0-596-00928-3<br />400 pages, $24.95 US, $34.95 CA, £17.50 UK <br /><br />Firefox has been around for several years and most of the hacks in the book are well documented on the web, but O'Reilly and Nigel McFarlane have brought you a book that brings the structure of the program and the usefulness of the hacks into one place.<br /><br />The power of the “hacks” series is that you can benefit from this book even if you don't have time to read through the whole thing. If you picked up the book to help you with re-branding Firefox, then you can go just to that section. Maybe you are needing Firefox to be a test bed for standards compatibility of a particular web project you are working on, then just read the sections of the book which apply. On the other hand, if you don't know what Firefox is capable of then you need simply to browse through the whole book to see what a powerful program Firefox is.<br /><br />The book covers a very wide variety of hacks. Many have to do with extensions that can be added onto Firefox. An extension can be considered as a pre-built hack with a nice installer. It is fitting then that many of these packaged hacks are covered in the book.<br /><br />Outside of just general use of the book for learning what Firefox is capable of, the book has great appeal for web developers. With the extensions available to developers to help in their work, there are quite a few development tools built into Firefox. Not the least of which is its standards compatibility. To know if something is well written one simply needs to view it in Firefox to see how a standards compliant browser renders the underlying code.<br /><br />The author used several phrases and vocabulary that would not be considered standard English. This is something that a company like O'Reilly, catering to their particular audience, might allow to become lax. Well written and edited books are hard to come by and often go unnoticed. It would have been better had the publisher spent a little more time on the editing of this work. It would be a shame that someone might be turned away from this book and its great content because of poor editing.<br /><br />With hacks ranging in difficulty from easy to advanced, this 377 page guide will get just about anyone hacking Firefox.<br /><br />I wish to offer condolences to the family as he has since passed away.<br /><br />Also submitted to O'Reilly and Amazon.</div>
