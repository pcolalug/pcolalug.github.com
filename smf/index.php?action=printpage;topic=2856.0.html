					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just moved here from Norfolk, VA (home of TWUUG - http://www.twuug.org/mediawiki/).&nbsp; Googled around for active computer clubs in the area and found you guys (and gals).<br /><br />Right now, my flavors of choice are Mandriva 2006, Knoppix and Auditor (now BackTrack).&nbsp; By the mentioning of Auditor/BackTrack you may correctly guess that I am interested in computer security - and that I specialize in wireless (in)security.<br /><br />Hope to make a couple of the meetings and actually say HI!<br /><br />- Theresa<br />http://www.schleppingsquid.net/</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome! Checked out your page which is very interesting. Good choice on using SMF. We&#039;re sort of partial to it around here. With your background in wireless (in)security :P I&#039;m sure you would have some great material for a presentation. Stop by the next meeting and sit in...and don&#039;t let lloydr scare you off. ;)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome to Pensacola, Theresa!&nbsp; Always nice to have another Squid join the LUG.&nbsp; I&#039;m about to retire from the USN myself, and staying in the area.&nbsp; Hope you can come to a meeting soon, the next one is May 20th.&nbsp; More info on that, and a link with directions, are available on the website.&nbsp; Wireless and security issues are always great for debate/discussion.&nbsp; Again, welcome and glad to have you aboard!<br /><br />Dan<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome to the group. There are plenty of security nuts in the group to talk shop with.<br /><br />We are a pretty active group. These forums are our main source of general interaction. Of course the meetings are big deals. We also have an IRC channel on freenode: #pcolalug. Love to have you jump in any or all three mediums.</div>
