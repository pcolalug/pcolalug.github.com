					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It's (finally) released, and picked up a copy today. &nbsp;Comes on 6 CD's and includes a Linux installer, just like UT2003 did. &nbsp;If you liked UT2003, you will LOVE this one! &nbsp;OMG, it rocks! &nbsp;There are several new gametypes, including Onslaught, which is cool beyond belief.<br /><br />For more info, or to try the (Linux/Win) demo, go here:<br />http://www.unrealtournament.com/ut2004/downloads.php<br /><br />P.S. - I bought mine at EB Games in Univ Mall, for 39.99, and it comes with a 20.00 rebate voucher... not bad.<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">No problem. Just by myself, I am a bit concerned with load. &nbsp;With just myself and 7 bots, I was looking at a 1.3-1.5 load on my AMD 1GHz server and 256MB ram. &nbsp;Oddly enough, I suspect that performance will actually be pretty good with more live players playing though.<br /><br />Looking forward to seeing the turnout.<br /><br />Scott</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am not sure I understood the post. &nbsp;I am not sure what good faith has to do with purchasing it or not, but if you change your mind, EB has about $30 in total rebates. &nbsp;$20 EB gift certificate and $10 back from the manufacturer if you send them the first page from the UT2003 manual.<br /><br />Assuming that most folks may buy another game this year and own UT2003; the net cost is $9.99 + 7.5% tax (Pensacola's tax rate, right)?<br /><br />Believe me when I say this is not negatively directed at you, but I will stump for a minute. &nbsp;The reason companies don't make Linux games as opposed to Windows or Mac is that the market just isn't there. &nbsp;If you (or anybody else) decide to buy this game and register it, make sure you put somewhere on the form or registration wizard that you are using it under Linux.<br /><br />UT2004 is what UT 2003 should have been. &nbsp;The six CD's worth of content &nbsp;upgrades, vehicles, and insanity made my $10 upgrade worth it and then some and I can put that $20 gift voucher towards Doom 3 when it is out.<br /><br />BTW, if you have old games gathering dust, sitting on your shelf, doing nothing and you don't want to deal with EBAY, trade them into EB. &nbsp;I traded in 4 or 5 for $11. &nbsp;Not a lot of cash, but it gave me back my shelf and covered the other 9.99+tax I paid for UT2004 in Daphne.<br /><br />I am not trying to convince you in particular to buy UT2004, but I am an avid fan of voting with my dollar. &nbsp;Between the rebates, unbelievably enhanced content, and the fact that they included Linux in the box, I have no problems playing advocacy monkey for Epic.<br /><br />Good luck! &nbsp;See y'all at the LAN party.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Rugmonster,<br /><br />How the heck were moving so quickly across the map, securing nodes. &nbsp;My load times on maps are so bad you normally had 1 or 2 nodes going by the time I got in, but it seemed like you and your bots were much more effective? &nbsp;Were you controlling them or letting them sweep?<br /><br />Scott</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I let the bots do their thing, but mostly my system loads maps quickly which helps and my ping was like 25 most of last night so that helped to. Mainly, when I start out, I look for the fastest vehicle I can and rush the node. If two bots are already on a node, I go to the next strategic one in the chain and wait. I played a little onslaught when the demo first came out when I was in Baghdad with the guys I work with. <br /><br />One thing that makes me mad about the bots, even though they are good, is they don't always link up in charging up a node. That is so crucial when you're playing online with a team. Also, charging vulnerable nodes after an attack helps a lot, but I play more offense than I do defense. <br /><br />I also found that when you find your team on defense, you can easily change the flow of the game by two people attacking a vulnerable node in the other teams back field. Most times, these will be untended because the other team is trying to take your node. If you can take one of theirs, you have turned the momentum and it gets the other team shaken up a bit and they'll start making mistakes.<br /><br />One more thing, I don't know if anyone has an Athlon64, but Atari has released a 64 bit build of the UT2k4 demo for linux. I now have even more reason to put together a Gentoo build on this system for my A64 and trying it out. I just hope I can get drivers...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don't know how most games work (my only experience is with ET), but are you using this as a public server? Even if it is just up during that time period, if it is public you should be able to get a few more people in to the game. <br /><br />The only downside to this is if the server fills up and someone from our group is not able to get on.<br /><br />This would also allow a specific place every week for our 2 or 4 people to go to, instead of having to decide every week where we would like to play.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just figured since you are hosting for the LUG and do have a limited number of slots, for the time that you are up for us, you could make it public for others. That would at least fill it up during the LUG time. Even though it would not be just us in there, it would at least make it more enjoyable for those who are there.<br /><br />This should not make it any more used/abused than you would allow for us if it were full.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I was hosting this for the LUG, not for the rest of the world. &nbsp;If I open it to the world, then LUG members can't get in. &nbsp;I am ok with the lack of real people joining. &nbsp;Rugmonster, seawolf, and myself can always find a server online somewhere else. &nbsp;I have no desire to run a server available to everyone. &nbsp;I did that specific job with Quake for an ISP in Virginia Beach, until the griefers just sucked the life out of it.<br /><br />If I run one at all, it will be only for this LUG and its members. &nbsp;Nice and intimate with folks I hope to be friends with... &nbsp;If there is a lack of interest in playing as there appears to be right now (we all have lives :) ), that is completely ok. &nbsp;I am sure the couple of us playing can hook up on a public server some night. &nbsp;If the interest grows, I just uncomment the cronjob.<br /><br />I get your point, but I have no desire to run a public server.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />Scott</div>
