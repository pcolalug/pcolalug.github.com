					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The link below has some excellent tips for using SSH.&nbsp; Especially noteworthy are how to use SSH without having to enter a password, and improving security with SSH (deny root access).&nbsp; Good reading!<br /><br />http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=05/12/02/2045226<br /><br />Dan<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">lloyd was telling me something about getting ssh to work with putty keyless.<br /><br />Not sure if if your security is improved that much, even with keyless though.&nbsp; Pretty much any admin sleazy enough to log a users keystrokes would more than likely just pull the file off the datastick if he really wanted.&nbsp; You could add security by having to su through multiple users, but that still wouldn&#039;t stop an intruder from some sort of priv escilation via buffer overflow if you don&#039;t update that often.&nbsp; (Honestly, someone needs to write a script for slack that auto updates any software with a security vunerablility)&nbsp; Basically, unless nothing nasty came down the pipe since my last upgrade, I consider a machine compromised when someone gets a user account.<br /><br /><br />http://www.slackware.com/security/list.php?l=slackware-security&amp;y=2005</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I guess the best solution would be to use one of the package management systems, and set the release to 10.2 instead of current.&nbsp; The slackware security updates get back-ported into the stable 10.2 10.1 10 etc folders, so updating would simply be installing security fixes.<br /><br />I&#039;m still trying to figure out how to generate a putty friendly key... :???:</div>

I just keep a private key generated with openssh on removable storage aswell as a putty generated key, then just put the public keys of the pair into your .ssh/authorized_keys2<br /><br />and done.....</div>
