					Title: <b>Linux vs. Windows</b><br />
					Post by: <b>steve</b> on <b>February 02, 2003, 03:10:51 pm</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">We all knew this would be the first topic since we are all so vocal about it.<br /><br />I submit that I like both Linux and Windows. I use Windows for my work stuff, play stuff, and mostly when I need to get something done. I use Linux when I want to &quot;geek&quot; out.<br /><br />Here's why:<br /><br />Windows has been around long enough and captured enough of the market that &quot;everything&quot; is supported under Windows. If I buy some hardware and don't want to do any research on compatibility or spend any amount of time getting it up and running, I use Windows. If I want to research before I buy my hardware and check whether it's compatible with my OS and then don't mind taking hours or days getting it running, then I run Linux. <br /><br />Linux requires attention when doing/installing new stuff, whether it be software or hardware. Windows is closer to &quot;plug-N-play&quot;.<br /><br />I run Linux at home because I don't do much more than surf, e-mail, listen to music, or watch videos. <br /><br />I run Windows at work because I have no idea what I'm going to be required to do next. I may have to install some legal software tomorrow, or test a new scanner the next day. Windows is guaranteed to be supported. Linux isn't. At work, I'm often required to read documents, spreadsheets, and presentations that were done up under MS Office. I've tried the other software like Open Office and Star Office and niether is 100% compatible. If I want my clients to be able to read my documents and I want to be able to read thiers, I use MS Office.<br /><br />Linux is more stable. I hear that all the time and it's true. But that's not necessarily true of the Linux apps. So, I don't have to reboot when an app crashes but I still have to restart the app and in some cases a reboot is necessary because the app can't be restarted until I clear out the memory it screwed up.<br /><br />Linux has some of the best networking tools around. Linux is great as a cheap firewall, router, internet/file server. It's cheap and not to difficult to set a basic installation up. <br /><br />So, in closing, I like both Windows and Linux, but I think Windows is more freindly when it comes to installing hardware and software and useability. Linux takes the cake when it comes to stability but still requires a geek to set it up and maintane it.<br /><br /><br />OK, bring it on.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Why is Windows chosen over Linux by so many people? &nbsp;When it comes right down to it, some of the first reason's given by most people don't seem to be true.<br /><br />Windows is easier to install. &nbsp;Not true, XP is in my opinion the easiest of the bunch to install, but previous versions folks had to have a DOS boot disk or use the boot CD, manually run FDISK (how many people complain about that in linux land, they have to do it for windows too). &nbsp;Then (in windows) you have to reboot, and then format your drive before you can even think about installing. &nbsp;Linux is the same (without the reboot). &nbsp;And most of the linux distros give you a text/graphical interface to do it all through that's a little nicer than the DOS counterparts.<br /><br />Linux apps are harder to install. &nbsp;Well, that really depends. &nbsp;Win Apps bundled with InstallShield are pretty good. &nbsp;But have you ever run into problems like installing a windows program only to try and run it and find out DLL's you need weren't included! &nbsp;At least package managers and the ./configure scripts on linux can usually catch those. &nbsp;On either platform you find yourself having to hunt down the missing software and manually install them. &nbsp;So no clear win for windows here either.<br /><br />Windows has better hardware support. &nbsp;Okay, definitely not true in my case. &nbsp;I have some old systems and hardware made for Windows 95. &nbsp;The companies went under, and no drivers were ever made for Windows 98/ME/2k/XP, so I'm out of luck. &nbsp;The best example is a WinModem I picked up for $10, the Motorolla SM56 PCI. &nbsp;It doesn't work in windows over 95b very well. &nbsp;Works perfectly in Linux thanks to open source drivers that can be continually updated. &nbsp;Gotta love it. &nbsp;Oh yeah, and my USB Xerox all-in-one printer/scanner/fax/copier. &nbsp;I haven't had any luck using it in windows with recent drivers, but thanks to the PCL3 driver in Linux, it works great there...<br /><br />So what does windows have going for it that linux doesn't? &nbsp;Sheer number of apps? &nbsp;I dunno, there's tons and tons of apps for linux. &nbsp;More than I could ever need. &nbsp;Is it games? &nbsp;Thanks to official ports by Loki/id Software and the people working on WINE, you can play most anything right in linux.<br /><br />I would like to see a better media player in linux. &nbsp;MPlayer is good but just feels kinda clumsy to use. &nbsp;Burning software is another point. &nbsp;And I guess while we're at it, HTML authoring software (something on-par with DreamWeaver).<br /><br />One of the things I've always disliked about linux (I guess UNIX) is having to manually mount/unmount disks (floppy/zip/CD) but with RedHat and I guess Mandrake it's not really an issue since they have the automounter or whatever it is.<br /><br />What do you guys think. &nbsp;What makes Windows king of the desktop? &nbsp;Linux isn't exactly the new kid on the block, what is it like 10 years old now?<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: imnes</div><div class="quote">Why is Windows chosen over Linux by so many people? &nbsp;When it comes right down to it, some of the first reason's given by most people don't seem to be true.<br /><br />Windows is easier to install. &nbsp;Not true, XP is in my opinion the easiest of the bunch to install, but previous versions folks had to have a DOS boot disk or use the boot CD, manually run FDISK (how many people complain about that in linux land, they have to do it for windows too). &nbsp;Then (in windows) you have to reboot, and then format your drive before you can even think about installing. &nbsp;Linux is the same (without the reboot). &nbsp;And most of the linux distros give you a text/graphical interface to do it all through that's a little nicer than the DOS counterparts.</div><br /><br />Ummm, let's compare apples to apples. XP compared to current Linux distros. &nbsp;A full version of XP is just as easy to install as a full version of the current Linux distros. <br /><br />Now let's look at what the general public has had to deal with over the years.<br /><br />When Windows 95 came out what Linux distros were any easier to install at that time. None. A full version of Windows 95 would partition the drive, format it, install itself, and startup. In the process it would autodiscover most of your hardware and install the drivers for you. Linux distros only started auto discovering hardware during install within the last couple of years.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: imnes</div><div class="quote">Linux apps are harder to install. &nbsp;Well, that really depends. &nbsp;Win Apps bundled with InstallShield are pretty good. &nbsp;But have you ever run into problems like installing a windows program only to try and run it and find out DLL's you need weren't included! &nbsp;At least package managers and the ./configure scripts on linux can usually catch those. &nbsp;On either platform you find yourself having to hunt down the missing software and manually install them. &nbsp;So no clear win for windows here either.</div><br /><br />Again, in general most Windows apps install without any problems. Why? Because &quot;ALL&quot; windows are built on the same documented APIs and DLLs and most apps use those APIs and DLLs. I have never run across a Windows App that required me to download a third party DLL unless you are talking about apps written in Visual Basic which require the runtime DLLs. Those Apps normally state that. Linux Apps can require any number of thousands of different libraries. Some require GCC , some require certain versions of libraries. Why? Because Linux distributions are not standardized in their installed base. There is a major difference between &quot;manually&quot; installing software in Windows versus Linux. Windows does not require me to go to a DOS shell and compile the program, then go into the registry and enter &quot;ALL&quot; settings for the software by hand. Linux apps, on the other hand, many times require hand compiling, with the proper switches (And, Oh, don't forget to modify the Make file first) then editing a config file in the etc directory or wherever it puts it. Then it may or may not run.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: imnes</div><div class="quote">Windows has better hardware support. &nbsp;Okay, definitely not true in my case. &nbsp;I have some old systems and hardware made for Windows 95. &nbsp;The companies went under, and no drivers were ever made for Windows 98/ME/2k/XP, so I'm out of luck. &nbsp;The best example is a WinModem I picked up for $10, the Motorolla SM56 PCI. &nbsp;It doesn't work in windows over 95b very well. &nbsp;Works perfectly in Linux thanks to open source drivers that can be continually updated. &nbsp;Gotta love it. &nbsp;Oh yeah, and my USB Xerox all-in-one printer/scanner/fax/copier. &nbsp;I haven't had any luck using it in windows with recent drivers, but thanks to the PCL3 driver in Linux, it works great there...</div><br /><br />OK, let's compare apples to apples. When that hardware first came out is was supported by Windows but not by Linux. So, what you're saying is that Linux is only guaranteed to run on old hardware. This isn't what the general public is running. If they have old hardware they are running Windows 95/98 and not Windows XP. Since XP costs $100 for the upgrade and you can get a new computer for $300 with it already installed, most people get the new hardware with the new OS. Drivers for Windows XP on the hardware is not a problems. However, Linux still lacks on drivers for new hardware.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: imnes</div><div class="quote">So what does windows have going for it that linux doesn't? &nbsp;Sheer number of apps? &nbsp;I dunno, there's tons and tons of apps for linux. &nbsp;More than I could ever need. &nbsp;Is it games? &nbsp;Thanks to official ports by Loki/id Software and the people working on WINE, you can play most anything right in linux.</div><br /><br />If quantity and not quality is important then Linux wins. However, look at the type of apps available for Linux vs Windows. The majority of Linux apps are utilities and network apps. While, the majority of Windows apps are user productivity apps. Try finding a database program that's as user friendly and &quot;easy&quot; to use as Access. I'm sure there's one out there, but there are a lot of flat file database programs already out there for Windows. How about an &quot;easy&quot; to install program to keep track of my video collection? How about an &quot;easy&quot; to install and use app to track the oil changes on my personal car? How about an &quot;easy to install and use &nbsp;app to watch TV through my ATI video card that uses Guide Plus? Nope, there are a lot of Linux apps out there but &quot;most&quot; of them are not for home use.<br /><br />Steve</div>

Nothing beats SQL Plus and Oracle for ease of use. I can do so much more with it and you don't need buttons, forms and other crap to get in the way, all you need to know is SQL. Plus, its fast *and* cross-platform!</div><br />See? We're both right in this hypothetical illustration.<br /><br />The truth is use what works. When you make recommendations to friends, co-workers, family, or businesses, base it on what you know of the systems available.<br /><br />Now, as to why Windows is so prolific, I thinks it is because it has gained so much power in the marketplace and MS has used that power to pressure OEM's to include their products exclusively in the rigs they ship. Now, this is not opinion, this has been proven in court.<br /><br />As for ease of use, I personally have lots of anecdotal evidence that clearly illustrates that *the* most intuitive and user-friendly OS to date was DOS 6.22 (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">sans</span> Win16, of course). <br /><br />I feel that Macs have user-friendly down better than anyone, as far as newbs are concerned. The cold hard truth is that computers are complex, unintutive, combersome things to use for most people. For the rest, they may be just complex and cumbersome at times.<br /><br />Ok, and I *got* to address the &quot;quantity over quality&quot; comment. First, how do you define quality? The availabilty of a GUI? Stabilty, utility, robustness, scalability, extensability, and correctness most assuredly. If that last sentance is your criteria, then I submit that there isn't a &quot;quality&quot; app made by MS. They're d**n hard to find on any OS. As for usability, its all what you are used to. Sure, Joe Sixpack might be used to GUI interfaces, but Joe's used to reboots, crashes, and BSOD's too. Its all in what you'll put up with as well...<br /><br />Binary file formats are going the way of the dinosaur. Interoperabilty and portability are the guiding principles of the new computing paradigm. Soon, it won't matter wether you are running windows, linux, BeOS (yes, its still around *and* actively developed in several forms), BSD, or Cosmoe, we'll all be running the same apps, sending emails and interoperating via the internet. What's more, we'll be doing on smaller, web-enabled devices which may be no more than access points to globally available computational resources.<br /><br />Now, for a prediction: With MS pushing .Net dirven web-services, shared code initiatives, and the attempt to foster &quot;grass-roots&quot; organizations built around their tech, I say that in two generations (software generations, not people generations, mind you), the operating system will be a commodity and windows will be free to download. Whatcha think about *that*?</div>

IMHO that means the majority of computer owners, not many of which know SQL. I called my Mother the other day to ask what the SQL statement was to do a global find and replace on a table. She didn't have any idea what I was talking about. However, she could walk me through it in the MS Access menu.<br /><br />Now, since I do know a limited amount of SQL then I would agree that it is faster and, if you know the language, easier to do things in SQL than through the MS Access menu. However, there's that learning curve again. It take about 10 minutes for a novice to create their first table in Access, start putting data into it, and view that data. It takes a few hours for a novice to find and learn the SQL statements to create a table, define the structure, populate it, and view the data. <br /><br />So, I'm not talking about what is faster and the general user isn't really concerened about what is faster or more efficient if it means they will have to pick up a book and read how to do it first.<br /><br />Working at Best Buy has taught me one big lesson. The general consumer either doesn't know how to read or refuses to read. We get many calls and products brought back because the buyer never read the book that came with it. Example: Most of the DVD players are returned because the buyer says they don't work. 9 out of 10 of them didn't remove the shipping screw as is stated in the manual and plastered all over the player. This is who we are recommending Operating Systems too. Applications written to run on Windows cater to these people. Linux Apps (for the most part) don't.<br /><br />Steve</div>

IMHO that means the majority of computer owners, not many of which know SQL. I called my Mother the other day (...) </div><br /><br />Not really my point, though. I just meant to point out (and you have illustrated nicely) that anicdotal arguments don't really get to the heart of the issue. Your mom uses a wizard, my mom can barely turn a PC on, and my friend's mom is a DBA. Who's the &quot;general&quot; user here? All of them use their pc's for web surfing, email, and swapping photos of the grandkids. <br /><br />With computers now in the majority of homes in the US, and with more and more homes having multiple pc's, its really hard to pin that &quot;average user&quot; down.<br /><br />So, which is better, Windows or Linux? My answer is 42. Its a moot point. What's best is what you are most comfortable with. Now, I think as Linux advocates (that's what we are, isn't it?), we should let folks know that there *are* alternatives to that butterfly thingy that can get the job done and do it better than what they may be used to. But that *my* subjective opinion. Debates about which platform is better for what user generally go nowhere. We've made our choices and we use our experiences to help those who aren't as knowledgable make thier choices.<br /><br />So, does Windows support more hardware than Linux? Well, what version of Windows? What version of Linux? What distro? Strictly bleeding edge hardware? Specialty scientific devices? Embedded systems?<br /><br />Which is easier to use? For who? To do what?<br /><br />Ultimately, this really gets nowhere, IMHO. If Windows does it for you and you can afford it, great! I happen to *like* Windows 2000, myself. It ain't purdy and it ain't always intuitive, and it certainly ain't always friendly to *this* user, but its acceptably stable and responsive, pretty secure when patched and properly administrated, and does what I want it to do most of the time. Would I ever run it at home? Hell no. Too pricey and doesn't really let me work the way I would *prefer* to. But that's just me.<br /><br />And, if the ugly truth be known, I think that computers in the hands of the general populace was a *horrible* idea in the first place. Folks don't want a general purpose computer, nor should they need one (marketroids do a great job of convincing folks that's what they want/need, though). Playstation/XBox/GameCube for gaming, internet appliances for everything web-related, DVD players, stereos, and televisions, the end. Folks have an easier time (and its hard enough as it is) understanding one device for one task (or a small related subset thereof).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just wanted to bring things back on topic. I have never been a huge fan of Windows vs Linux debates. I don't see them as being hugely productive for anything other than detract from the overall perception of Linux by non-users and newbies. I think every operating system has a place and a need. It is up to the user to decide which operating system they need. <br /><br />I don't like MS because they have made it hard for the consumer to make that decision through their anticompetitive actions. Despite this, MS got where they are now through actually having a good product at one time. Like dpeach said in another thread (http://www.pcolalug.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=441&start=15), they did have good products, but have failed to make anything really new recently. <br /><br />Even though they haven't done anything new in a while, they still have products that meet the needs of people. People wouldn't use Windows or any other MS product if it didn't. Linux may be better for us, but it isn't the be all and end all of operating systems because there are things that it isn't best at. No operating system is best for everything, so I won't say that Linux <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> better than Windows. I will say, however, Linux is what <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I prefer</span> to use for most tasks.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think we beat that one to death ;) &nbsp;At least we got some discussion out of it! &nbsp;<br /><br />When it really comes down to it, it doesn't matter what OS wins. &nbsp;Linux being opensource doesn't automatically make it 'better' than windows, and vice-versa. &nbsp;<br /><br />Talking about XP, once it's installed and on hardware that it's happy with, it's excellent. &nbsp;It rarely ever requires reboots and just seems rock-solid. &nbsp;(Okay, so does NT 4.0). &nbsp;And it's reasonably quick on any recent hardware (400mhz+). &nbsp;But I did have one big gripe about XP. &nbsp;And maybe it's just because I wasn't sure how to resolve it. &nbsp;I have a computer I wanted to put XP on, but mid-way through the install I'd get a STOP screen with a message to contact my hardware vendor. &nbsp;Only problem is I wasn't sure which device it was. &nbsp;Really annoying. &nbsp;Came down to just pulling parts and disabling features 'til it would load properly. &nbsp;Ended up being the sound card, oh well. &nbsp; Works now though :)<br /><br />My main computer is my linux machine and it's been down for a few weeks now, waiting on a replacement motherboard. &nbsp;I've been living in NT 4.0 sp6a on a HP Vectra XU Dual PPro 200 scsi machine. &nbsp;It runs great. &nbsp;Linux doesn't run so great on it (at least not with Gnome2 or KDE3, fvwm is real responsive though). &nbsp;I can't choose a winner, I like most of the os's out their for various reasons. &nbsp;I like MacOS which I use at school, WinNT (and it's descendents), BeOS which I have on one machine, QNX I have on another old machine, Linux/BSD. &nbsp;They all serve the job of desktop OS great, and all have a wide range of apps to play with. &nbsp;<br /><br />There was some talk about MS Access above. &nbsp;I personally can't function in access very well. &nbsp;I do much better (and quicker) in MySQL. &nbsp;To each his own I guess.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm with everyone else. This one's been done long enough. <br /><br />As far as Windows vs Linux discussions go, I also think that they serve different purposes for different people and that there's not one single solution for everyone.<br /><br />The reason behind this topic and this forum is to try to keep the &quot;insert name here&quot; bashing out of the general discussions and let the &quot;mine is better than your's and your's sucks&quot; stuff take place here.<br /><br />So next debate? Nvidia vs ATI? Which is better for Linux?<br /><br />I don't know. Someone else pick the next debate.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It's been our experience that clients and customers are happier with Windows on the desktop and Linux or FreeBSD on the server.</div>
