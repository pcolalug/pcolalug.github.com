					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Saw this article on Distrowatch, which kind of summarizes the major distros in 2006.&nbsp; Based on my own personal experiences, it seems fairly accurate.<br /><br />http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20061218#feature<br /><br />Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!<br /><br />Dan<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I agree that it was a good review. I don&#039;t know a lot about all the distros, but it nailed the three I know. Ubuntu, Mandriva and Slackware.<br /><br />I admit I did not touch the latest release of Mandriva, but I would not have been quite as kind to Mandriva as the article was. Mandriva may not have done anything necessarily wrong. I thought it was still a nice stable system. The problem to me is that the community disappeared. Used to you could go to websites to download software and there would be Mandriva RPMs. Those days are long gone and have been since the early release in 2005. That was a long time ago.<br /><br />Ubuntu still has a good following. Community is nice. But I agree that they have probably peaked. They will still be up there for a while. Too bad they are so Gnome centric.<br /><br />Slackware has a pretty strong community. But I am not sure how long that will hold out. It is kinda frustrating that we tout the whole Open Source model and then have 1 person control the whole distro. Not that it affects me personally, but it seems that Slack will die due to lack of interest. Open Source is a big ego trip in many ways. Therefore the fewer people involved that get to put their name in the distro, the sooner it will loose its followers. On the other hand, Pat has kept it alive this long...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don&#039;t agree with the &quot;ubuntu has peaked&quot; thing.&nbsp; I continue to see ubuntu as the #1 entry point for people new to linux, as (for the most part) this distro goes out of its way not only to make sure &quot;things just work&quot;, but they have also adopted the debian and gentoo practice of *heavily* documenting everything.&nbsp; I like that.<br /><br />To be fair though, if ubuntu went away, and debian actually stuck to a decent release schedual, I&#039;d probably use it.&nbsp; I am apt-solutely (;D) in love with aptitude.&nbsp; It&#039;s astounding just how fast you can install software with it.&nbsp; Given how massive debian&#039;s repositories are, I may never have to compile from source again.&nbsp; I love that.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I got to thinking about this thread a bit more today. I have something else that I have to agree with the author about, but I would put more emphasis on it than he did.<br /><br />Slackware&#039;s website really needs an update. Sure it is functional, but it is horribly static. There is nothing there to drive users to visit the site. No news except when there is another release announced. It seems like it would be hard to convince users to give it a try. You look at the website and it seems more outdated than Debian Stable.<br /><br />The install process is also pretty antiquated, but that does not bother me as much. It is the dead website that potential users will see first that will make the decision for them to stay away. Update the website Pat. Please.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, the first time I saw the Slackware website, it was in lynx.&nbsp; I was looking for an alternative to a busted Redhat install.&nbsp; Looked great then! :D<br /><br />Ian</div>
