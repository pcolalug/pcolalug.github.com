					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You could always cheat and use NDIS like I did - that way, you could use any wifi adapter.<br /><br />NDIS works under Linux and *BSD.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">NDISWrapper isn't a sure fire solution. Native support is always more desirable.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Obviously. &nbsp;NDISWrapper is for the vast majority of devices on the market which have only Windows drivers. &nbsp;NDISWrapper has worked for me in every device I've tested it on. &nbsp;Good enough for me :D</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I make it a point to only support (buy) hardware that works with Linux natively. &nbsp;My reasoning is that if everyone did that, eventually all the hardware would be compatible. &nbsp; :D <br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sometimes you just can't find compatible hardware. &nbsp;Besides, this isn't going to make vendors supply Linux-compatible hardware - but press coverage will ;) &nbsp;Voting with one's wallet only works if the target is aware that you are doing so...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I had trouble using ndiswrapper with a wifi card on a laptop, would lock up after a few minutes of using it. &nbsp; That's the only time I tried it though, I guess works better for some cards than others.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That may be true. &nbsp;I'm using DSL on an old Toshiba 335CDS laptop, it's got a Linksys WPC11 rev. 4 card in it that's not supported natively by Linux, but it's running NDIS and has been up continuously for the last 4 months. &nbsp;I use it as a backup mail server, it talks UUCP over SSH-wrapped TCP/IP.</div>
