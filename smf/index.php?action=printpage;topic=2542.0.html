					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The August meeting is on for the 20th, at All Pro Sound (on Beverly Blvd). &nbsp;Due to popular demand, this meeting will once again include a LAN Party for your gaming pleasure! &nbsp;If you're not a gamer, there will also be things to do, such as get help with a problem, or help someone else...<br /><br />Date: August 20th<br />Place: All Pro Sound (806 Beverly Blvd, just west of W Street) -- Please use the entrance on the back side of the building.<br />Time: 2:00pm until...... approx 10pm or whenever<br /><br />If you've never been to one before, here's what it's all about: You bring your computer (and monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc...) and we all plug them into a local network. We'll have a game server connected too, and we play games against each other (more on that later). There can be other geeky stuff going on too, as desired, like assistance with an installation or other problem fixing. It's pretty informal. At 6:00pm we'll take a break for our normal PLUG monthly meeting, and then resume the gaming battles.<br /><br />In the past we've pretty much played Enemy Territory, and that will probably be the main attraction again. If someone really wants another game, post something in the Club Discussions forum and we'll try to accomodate. I know for sure we could do Return to Castle Wolfenstein...<br /><br />It's a lot of fun and you'll enjoy yourself if you come. We need everybody we can get, so plan ahead to make it!<br /><br />What you need to bring: Your computer, monitor, KB, mouse, power cords, headphones. There will be a large network switch provided, and plenty of network cables (but it wouldn't hurt to bring your own just in case). If you have some extra power strips, keyboards, mouse, etc... you can bring them in case someone forgets theirs. There will be popcorn and soft drinks there, and feel free to bring your own munchies/drinks (including &quot;adult beverages&quot;). &nbsp;Often we have chipped in about $5 and ordered out for pizza if there's interest in that.<br /><br />Mark it on your calendar and hope to see you there!!!<br /><br />Dan</div>
