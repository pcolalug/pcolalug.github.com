					Title: <b>Dvorak usage?</b><br />
					Post by: <b>dpeach</b> on <b>June 06, 2004, 02:00:11 pm</b>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have been a closet Dvorak user and it came out last night. I am wondering what other people know about this keyboard layout and if others have tried it.<br /><br />I have to admit that my speed has not come up to where I want it to be yet. Currently I am typing in the high 20s to low 30s (WPM) with Dvorak. QWERTY was 65-70. Which is now totally shot since I don't know where keys are on the QWERTY keyboard. I have typed so long on QWERTY that I could not tell you the keyboard layout, but I could type it for you. :)<br /><br />I had tried Dvorak before, but it would not work for me because of typing on so many other machines. Now I have more control of my environment. I have been back at it for the last 2 weeks.<br /><br />rburt, now that I have got it learned, I can put the keycaps back in their right places for you.</div>
