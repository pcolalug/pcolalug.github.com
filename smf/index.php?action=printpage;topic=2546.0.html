					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Good Day Everyone, My name is Max Hammond and I'm an independent MCSE contract instructor, teaching the basics in Microsoft (is that word considered profane here?) networking. <br /><br />I run several small networks in town and have been using Linux as a cost effective replacement for the M.... word. I've mainly been using the RHEMS project from sourceforge and have been using that as base for my Linux education. I've got three linux e-mail servers out there and the latest toy has been phpgroupware.<br /><br />I hope to be able to contribute something to the group, but I still consider myself a &quot;newbie&quot;.<br /><br />Certifications mean nothing if you can't back it up with experience.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome, Max! While most of the folks here are hardcore Linux, I think most of us agree that you have to use the right tool for the job. At my job, I work in a mixed Microsoft/Oracle/Sun/Cisco network and I plan on getting my MCSE before I get out of the Air Force...along with an CCNP, LPIC Level 1 and SCSA. <br /><br />If we can help you out at all, throw us a question and here's a question for you. How are the MS Press MCSE Self-Paced Study books? As soon as I get done with my CCNA in a few weeks, I'm going to start working on the MCSA/MCSE and need to find the best self study solution.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome. Glad you are taking the time to give Linux a serious look. It may not be the right choice in every situation, but you never know until you try.<br /><br />Enjoy the forums. There is a lot of information here. Do a search then ask away.</div>
