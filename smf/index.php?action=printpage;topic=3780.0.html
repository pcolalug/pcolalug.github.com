					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This is maxolasersquad, David, again from Tallahassee.&nbsp; Last Ubuntu LTS I went out to Pensacola and did a release party with y&#039;all.&nbsp; I had discussed I would probably only do this during the LTSes given the driving necessary, and how I would pretty much be taking over all of your meetings if we did it every release.<br />Anyhow, the next LTS has been planned for April of next year.&nbsp; I thought I would go ahead and chime in to see if your group was still up for mixing a Pensacola LUG meeting with a release party.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Wow! That is a bit of planning. More than a year in advance. My hat is off to you. If it were me I would be finally getting around to an announcement like this in March of next year.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I can&#039;t answer for the group, but I won&#039;t be in town for the event.</div>
