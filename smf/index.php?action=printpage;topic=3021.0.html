					Title: <b>Microsoft Eases Licensing for Virtualization</b><br />
					Post by: <b>rugmonster</b> on <b>October 05, 2006, 05:13:09 pm</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I saw an article on The Register (http://www.theregister.com/2006/10/05/free_virtual_ms/) about Microsoft changing its licensing for Windows Server 2003 Datacenter Edition to allow an unlimited number of virtualized instances of its Windows Server OS to run on a single licensed system. Is this a reaction to market pressures as Linux and Solaris make strides in the server market, or could there be other reasons for Microsoft to make this move? Considering Datacenter Edition is incredibly expensive for a single license, this isn&#039;t much of a boon for many folks.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Help me out here,<br /><br />I&#039;ve never been able to see the benefit of running more than one OS on a machine at the same time (unless, for example with vmware you need it to use a windows application).&nbsp; I mean, is application compatibility the main reason people want this?&nbsp; It seems to there are very real constraints otherwise.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">A lot of times, your server hardware sits mostly idle for the majority of the time. Virtualization allows you to consolidate multiple servers onto a single platform. You end up with better server utilization, less hardware overhead and costs. The down side is that if something goes wrong with the single server, you have multiple systems down. The way you over come this is by using some sort of high availability solution. The other major advantage is you can do rapid recovery from catastrophic failure because you can provision a new load of the system in drastically reduced time. Also, you can backup the entire image of the system in near real time and you can load it on any virtualization server.<br /><br />Where I work, I would love to have virtualized setup so rather than managing 50+ servers which lose hard drives on reboots, I could have maybe 15 or so. The loads on our systems hardly ever rise about 10% or 15% at peak times and average out at ~1%. We&#039;ve already done consolidation as much as our leadership has allowed. With a virtualized solution, our hardware overhead could easily be cut by 75% with minimal impact on overall performance.</div>
