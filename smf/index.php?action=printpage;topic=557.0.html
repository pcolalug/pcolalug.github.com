					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you like linux machines you'll love Google. &nbsp;This article is slightly outdated by their current numbers, but it will give you an idea of what they have. <br /><br />Here's some highlights:<br />When this article was written google was processing 13,000,000 searches a day. &nbsp;That number is over 200,000,000 now. &nbsp;So keep that in mind, the rest of the numbers have grown as well.<br /><br />Google employs clusters of inexpensive small single processor intel x86-based machines. &nbsp;These machines each of between 256mb and 1gb of Ram, and dual hard drives (either 22gb each or 40gb each). &nbsp;At the time of this article they had about 3500 machines and 7000 hard drives powering their search engine. &nbsp;(I think they surpassed 10,000 servers in 2001).<br /><br />All these machines run on Linux. &nbsp;(A modified distribution of RedHat last I heard). &nbsp;Using custom load-balancing and management software engineered by google programmers.<br /><br />I haven't seen a pic of their servers but they have to be tiny. &nbsp;They can fit 80 servers in a 7' rackmount configuration.<br /><br />Here's the article from Intel. &nbsp;Google had a much better and more up-to-date one on their site a few months back but I can't find it again.<br />http://www.intel.com/eBusiness/casestudies/snapshots/google.htm<br /><br />Nick</div>
