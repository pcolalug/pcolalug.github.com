It is compatible with AIM (Oscar and TOC protocols), ICQ, MSN Messenger, Yahoo, IRC, Jabber, Gadu-Gadu, and Zephyr networks.<br /><br /><br />You still need to create and AIM account. I'm not sure how to do it in GAIM as I'm at work right now.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Alright, I guess I'm even more confused than I thought I was... &nbsp;I did say ICQ, and maybe I meant IRC...? &nbsp;I'm looking for what allows you to &quot;chat&quot; in a topic-specific channel, like &quot;#mandrake&quot;, after connectiing to a specific server. &nbsp;Can someone clarify ICQ/IRC and what client software is good.<br /><br />I do have GAIM working fine for IM'ing, and will explore it's ICQ/IRC abilities later when I get home. &nbsp;Thanks.<br />Dan</div>

ICQ is very much like IM, just a different protocol. I have only used GAIM for IM, but I'm sure the other modes work as well.<br /><br />I have used the IRC client in Mozilla before. Quite a pain for me to set up since I do not understand how IRC works. But, with a little patience and trying every concievable configuration, I was able to get it going. I am sure GAIM would work much better.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've got XChat running, finally. &nbsp;Tried to do a sourcecode compile installation (ver 2.0.1), and got an error something to the effect of missing GTK...something...something.... &nbsp;and ended up with a text-only version. &nbsp;It worked but wasn't what I wanted. &nbsp;Anybody know what's up with that GTK error (I'm using Mdk9.1)? &nbsp;So I ended up getting a Mandrake (texstar) version 2.0.0 RPM that installed fine.<br /><br />Is there a certain server that some of you guys use? &nbsp;There are so many that I don't know which to use...<br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Like I have said so many times before, I hang out in #linux on EFNet (http://www.efnet.net). To get into #linux you need to have identd enabled. The way you can check for that is when you get connected to a server, type /who &lt;nick&gt; and look for a tilde (~) in front of your information. Also, to get on efnet, you can either type into your irc client /server irc.efnet.net as this is a round robin dns name or go look on the efnet site for a server. *Hint* Stay away from irc.prison.net...<br /><br />Oh yeah, there is also Freenode (http://www.freenode.info). This is a whole network mainly for open projects. Many of our favorite distributions have official and unofficial channels there.<br /><br />If you ever want to look me up, I go by Ruggy and mainly stick to efnet and freenode.</div>
