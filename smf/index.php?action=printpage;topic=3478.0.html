					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The February meeting is coming up this Thursday, February 19. Please attend if possible. We would love to have your company.<br /><br />We have a new sponsor and a door prize for this meeting. The new sponsor is PremiumMemory.com (http://www.premiummemory.com/). They sent us a 1 GB SD card. We will give it away in a random drawing at the meeting. Anyone who attends will be eligible to win. The interesting feature of this card is that it has a small panel that slides off and allows you to insert the card into a USB port, eliminating the need for a card reader.<br /><br />Please join us at 6:00 down at SSI. If you have any questions or need a ride to the meeting, please post here and we will try and work out the details.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for letting us know you were thinking about coming. I know of 3 regulars who cannot attend tonight. But that gives me a better chance of winning the door prize.<br /><br />As for danc&#039;s sponsorship question, we discussed it in the IRC channel. I will talk about that tonight at the meeting.</div>
