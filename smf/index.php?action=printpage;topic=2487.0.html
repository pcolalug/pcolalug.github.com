					Title: <b>The Linksys NSLU2 Sucks!</b><br />

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Don't buy a Linksys NSLU2 USB 2.0 Network Attached Storage device!!!<br /><br />A week or so ago, I bought one off of Newegg.com. I thought,&quot;Hey! Here's a little device I can put a drive in a USB external enclosure on and make it a SMB fileserver for my network. What a great idea! I won't have to leave my desktop on all the time wasting electricity.&quot; Upon further investigation, I discovered it runs an embedded version of Linux with Samba. How much cooler can that little box be?<br /><br />So for around $80 I ordered one. I got it very quickly (thank you Newegg) and put my hard drive on it. I knew it would format my drive with ext2, so I made sure nothing was on it before I put it on there. I changed the IP, got it on my Samba domain, browsed to the share and got to my files.<br /><br />As is par for the course with me, I checked for a newer version of the firmware. Sure enough, there was one. I was running R25 and R29 was available. The device is completely managed through a web interface, very similar to the WRT54G or any other Linksys device. I download the firmware, unzipped it and uploaded the file through the web management interface from my linux desktop running Firefox. It very nicely said that the upgrade would take about 5 minutes. I waited and then got an error saying the upgrade failed and to try upgrading it again. Only problem was that when I tried to upload it again, I got a Javascript error saying the document contained no data. Well, even though everything was telling me not to do it, I unplugged the box. When I turned it back on, the status light just flashed red and green. Suck.<br /><br />After a conversation with Linksys tech support, we declared it dead. Thankfully, I was able to get an RMA from Newegg and promptly sent it off. Fast-forward to today. FedEx knocked on my door and had my replacement NSLU2. I opened the bad boy up, threw it on the network and got the IP changed for my internal subnet. I set it up and tried to listen to some mp3s off of it since I had populated the drive while being directly connected to my desktop.<br /><br />Only problem was that when I would play an mp3, it would play all of about a second and then stop. No disk activity or anything on the drive connected to the NSLU2. I couldn't access the web management page. The firmware was R24...maybe a firmware upgrade would fix it. I downloaded the firmware, R29, from Linksys's site again in hopes that it would upgrade properly and fix my issues. Once again, upgrade failed and before I unplugged the bastard, I talked to Linksys support. They directed me to unplug it, so I did and once again flashing red and green status light. In the Xbox modding community, this is referred to as FRAGged (Flashing Red and Green). After convincing the Linksys tech that I had seen this before and that it was dead and doing their dance (and trying to convince them that I wasn't running Windows, just tell me what you want to do instead of asking me if I know how to get to the command prompt and run ping like this), they declared it dead. My second unit was dead.<br /><br />A short call to Newegg got me my second RMA, only this one is for a full refund. No restocking fee. No hassle. Thank god Newegg wasn't a hassle. Moral of the story, don't buy one of these. What a piece of crap.</div>
