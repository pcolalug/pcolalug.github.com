					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Was the kernel source (2.6.13) you pointed to the same source that was used to build the kernel that you were running when you ran that nvidia installer? &nbsp;If not, then it won't be able to load that module until you reboot to the 2.6.13 kernel.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Are you sure Nvidia's drivers support 2.6.13. Keep in mind that 2.6.13 is only a couple of weeks old. Perhaps it is saying incorrect path because the files you are providing are different than what the installer is looking for. Not the most accurate error message, but very possible. I know ATI doesn't have support for 2.6.13 out yet, and even though everyone hates them, Nvidia may be a little behind the bleeding edge. It's not like running 2.6.12 is going to kill you while waiting for Nvidia support.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well,<br /><br />I actually did manage to get it &quot;working&quot; thanks to a guy on alt.os.slackware, with the same problem. &nbsp;Turns out the nvidia framebuffer driver (NOT RIVA) was conflicting with the *76 video driver. &nbsp;I had everything set, rebooted, and lo and behold I had video. &nbsp;<br /><br />However, I could obviously tell something was up with my video. &nbsp;So I did xorgconfig with my *known good* values for my lcd, I pop back into X, and I get &quot;out of sync&quot; errors. &nbsp;Well now, I know what your thinking, &quot;those were the wrong sync values&quot;, negative. &nbsp;<br /><br />Those were the exact specs for that lcd pulled from the website many moons ago, and they worked flawlessly till now. &nbsp;What we have here, gentilemen, is a borked driver. &nbsp;I'll simply have to wait till nvidia releases another driver.</div>

I believe a few of the gentoo guys love their framebuffer (can't confirm but IIRC). I personally don't care for the framebuffer.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I went into xorgconf and set my sync to the closest option to my specs, and it works now. &nbsp;I highly doubt any 3d game will run in sync though, as I needed my custom specs to see anything except &quot;out of range&quot; before.<br /><br />Oh well, I have transparency, I have full screen miss september. &nbsp;I don't have time for games. &nbsp;So it works out.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just a quick update to this thread...&nbsp; I am now running Slackware on all my machines, and recently did a new kernel (2.6.13.4) on my main desktop machine.&nbsp; Installed the Nvidia driver with no issues, and it works fine.&nbsp; &nbsp;8)<br /><br />Dan<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I upgraded from 2.6.13 to 2.6.13.3 before .4 was around, still no issues with nvidia&nbsp; &nbsp;:P<br /><br />might upgrade to 2.6.13.4 if I get bored, otherwise I think I&#039;m just gonna wait till 2.6.14 as these 2.6.x.y upgrades every few days are getting old lol</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It makes perfectly good sense when you consider that it&#039;s supported by a third party driver, which (imo) hasn&#039;t upgraded to the current kernel api.&nbsp; Much like my modem.&nbsp; Best of luck getting that thing to work with a recent kernel.&nbsp; All boils down to developers not keeping up with current kernel changes.</div>
