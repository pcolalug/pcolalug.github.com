					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I decided since the distro's I seem to like are all Debian based to just try out Debian itself. &nbsp; I'm installing it onto two machines to see how the respective desktops are on it, Debian + KDE 3.3 on my Laptop, and Debian + Gnome 2.8.1 on my Desktop machine.<br /><br />Just started the laptop install, and for those of you that played with Ubuntu, they used this installer. &nbsp;Nothing's changed, it's identical - even wifi access-point setup in the installer. <br /><br />The partition tool looks pretty powerful, can setup logical volume manager, raid arrays, etc. &nbsp;I didn't get into that, only single drives on both my machines. &nbsp;<br /><br />I'll post more info once I get the machines up and running. &nbsp;<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Nick, have you ever tried MEPIS...? &nbsp;It's Debian based also, and seems pretty decent (I'm posting from it now). &nbsp;It includes the apt-get stuff, although I haven't tried that out yet.<br /><br />I have never cared much for KDE, but this flavor of it seems (almost) bearable. &nbsp;Might want to give it a look...<br /><br />http://www.mepis.org<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Looks interesting. &nbsp;I'm more of a Gnome fan than KDE but I wanted to try the latest release of both to see how they compare. &nbsp;<br /><br />I've gotten the systems and most of my typical applications installed without a problem. &nbsp;The debian package system is still the best. &nbsp;<br /><br />One thing I'm struggling to figure out now is how to get clean auto-mounting support into the systems. &nbsp;On the Gnome side I've installed hal + pmount + gnome-volume-manager. &nbsp;But so far nothing is happening. &nbsp;So I need to dig in some more and get it figured out.<br /><br />On the KDE side I'm not really sure what is available to handle it. &nbsp;Maybe magicdev but I'm not sure. &nbsp;I'll have to read up on that too, see what fedora / mandrake / suse are doing to get it.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Definately testing, Unless you plan to use it as a server only.<br /><br />Debian stable is old as dirt. &nbsp;They make fbsd packages look wet behind the ears.<br /><br />Having said that I'm glad debian has made some progress in the installer dept. &nbsp;The last time I installed it I was pretty lost (and this is comming from slackware) with getting everything properly set up.<br /><br />To be fair though...if there's ever a distro that documents everything in their config files...it's debian. &nbsp;Often times I'll boot up knoppix just to see if &nbsp;a config file has some weird little option I need. &nbsp;Comming from slackware, I like that.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Testing (sarge) will get you KDE 3.2, Gnome 2.6 era software. &nbsp;Once installed I upgraded to Unstable (sid) and that got me latest everything, KDE 3.3, Gnome 2.8.1, and FireFox 1.0. <br /><br />Also, when it comes to getting software on Debian, if something is not included on the default servers check the site:<br />http://www.apt-get.org<br /><br />You can search for the software you want, and add 3rd party sotware repositories to apt to get access to them.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I got Sarge instaled via FTP. It was very easy. I need to go back and figure out which Video card I actually have. (I'm used to the other distors auto detecting it and wasn't ready for Debian to ask which card I had) Right now it's set at Vesa.<br /><br />Other than that, I'm pretty impressed with the install. Apps and all seem to be the same as you get with any other distro so I don't expect to much user interface difference between it and SuSE, Fedora, Mandrake, etc.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">X is pretty good at auto-detecting. &nbsp;If you run X -configure (or X11 -configure) it will spit out an XF86Config.new into your home directory that you can look in for your card.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm thinking about running Debian on my new box instead of Slackware, just to see how I like it (especially since everyone says nice things about it, figured it's probably changed some since I last tried it, and I was using the &quot;stable&quot; version as well).<br /><br />Can Debian use ReiserFS or does it use something different like EXT3? &nbsp;I ask because I'd really rather not wipe out my /home partition but I get the feeling I might have to.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I used ext3 when I installed I guess that was the default, but looks like reiserfs module is included (at least in the 2.6 kernel), so you can probably mount your filesystem no problem.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Filesystems are dependent on the kernel you use. Just because there is one included in the install doesn't mean you have to use that kernel.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay, with that I think I'll backup my /home directories (because I don't want them to be overwritten with the recreation of new users, unless it won't do that) and install Debian. &nbsp;Yeah, I've worked to get a lot of stuff installed properly but I don't think it'll be a big issue. &nbsp;Besides, if I like Debian it could be a good change.<br /><br /><br />I like Slackware very much and when I'm unsure of what to do with a system it's the first thing I use, but I think I'd like to branch out in my &quot;general&quot; understanding of other distributions, see if there's anything else that more perfectly suits me.<br /><br />I'll let you know how it goes. &nbsp;If nothing else, I was going to have to rebuild my kernel anyway so I figured, &quot;Eh, why go through all that trouble when I can go through even MORE trouble and switch distros again?&quot; I know, it doesn't make any sense, but that's the reason to do something sometimes. &nbsp; :lol:</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Fun problem with installation of Sarge through MiniCD:<br /><br />Doesn't configure my network card properly with DHCP. &nbsp;Tried to configure it manually but transmittance keeps dying out. &nbsp;I just upgraded my firmware on the router so I've got NO idea as to why it's not taking this. &nbsp;Any thoughts?<br /><br /><br /><br />Understandably it'll be just a little difficult to complete installation without it properly utilizing the network card. &nbsp;For reference I've got an onboard card with my NFORCE3 motherboard that Slackware had no issue with.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It's a little strange, coming from Slackware, but I'm sort of feeling my way out and reading the previous postings here have helped. &nbsp;It's REALLY unnerving to not be able to run &quot;xwmconfig&quot; and choose a window manager. &nbsp;I ran &quot;apt-get install kde&quot; and somehow that seemed to have gotten me KDE so I'm not going to question it too much, but what happens when I want to run Gnome AND KDE and how do I switch between them?<br /><br /><br />Currently I'm having a more fundamental issue though. &nbsp;Just how do I get my ntfs partition (this is a dual-boot machine) mounted on Linux in Debian? &nbsp;Slackware automatically asked me about it and it's proved invaluable for file transfer. &nbsp;How do I go about doing that here in Debian?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Heh, makes me wish I kept a backup of my fstab in Slackware, now I'm going to have to go into it semi-blind. &nbsp;Well, that's the fun of learning something new, right? &nbsp;I mean, assuming I'm successful with completing the finishing touches on Debian for my needs I think I'll have a more rounded understanding of how Linux works and the different ways it can work.<br /><br /><br /><br />So far I'm not able to call it &quot;user-friendly&quot; like Mandrake or Fedora but it's not exactly &quot;unfriendly,&quot; more like the happy medium. &nbsp;If I wasn't fully aware of apt-get then I probably wouldn't have KDE, X, and a good amount of other things working properly but I still have only the baseline knowledge about apt-get, enough to know how to get something and remove something.<br /><br />I found Slackware to give me a more workable system faster (and it had no issue with my motherboard using the 2.4 kernel) but I think so far that Debian gives me a bit more control in what's actually on the system. &nbsp;I like the inclusion of GRuB (another prog I have to learn) and some of the concepts of Debian like &quot;base system&quot; and portage remind me a lot of BSD in terms of philosophy (I don't know about how it works in practice yet, still finding a place to put that spare box).<br /><br />So thus far I like it. &nbsp;I don't like it more but I also don't like it less than Slackware, it's just really different. &nbsp;Both so far have given me a tremendous amount of power over the installation without much, if any, fluff but were friendly enough for installation to be accomplished in an hour or two (a MAJOR plus in my book). &nbsp;Slackware is more familiar to me so I had an easier time getting acquainted with it but I'm really like Debian's built-in package system.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />That does remind me, there's been some oddities regarding Debian packages. &nbsp;I'll get some recommendations from apt-get like libdvdcss2 and libdvdcss which I'm needing. &nbsp;So I tell it to apt-get install libdvdcss and it tells me that there's a reference to the package but it's not there. &nbsp;Huh? &nbsp;Well where on earth is it? &nbsp;So far that's been the only oddity.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><i>Update</i>:<br /><br />Due to some utter STRANGENESS I've decided to recompile a new kernel. &nbsp;I think the benefits will be obvious and immediate (hopefully) though it may not correct some of my issues.<br /><br />Currently I'm having some problems with the runlevel. &nbsp;I've been reading a lot about how Debian does things with initialization and I can't for the life of me figure out why it's booting into runlevel 5 when the default is clearly listed as 2 (and I'd rather 3). &nbsp;However, I'm willing to let that slide for the moment.<br /><br />cdrecord cannot find a burning target. &nbsp;This is REALLY odd to me since Slackware had no issue of any kind seeing my NEC 2510A as a burner (Dual layer DVD+-R/RW) so now I can't back up any discs. &nbsp;I tried some quick modding of the /etc/fstab but to no avail. &nbsp;Oh well. &nbsp;I'm hoping a new kernel with different support will fix that. &nbsp;If not...I don't know what to do.<br /><br />With K3B it complains of not having the dvd+rw-tools package installed but I just went out and installed it with apt-get. &nbsp;It used to give two errors about this but now it's just got one (I also apt-get'd the cdrdao tools) and can't seem to get rid of it. &nbsp;Real...strange.<br /><br /><br />So anyway, for the moment I'm still feeling things out and just encountering strangeness but I'm sure it's due to needing more configuration. &nbsp;Hopefully a new kernel will fix all that. &nbsp;If nothing else, having the kernel sources will make installing the nVidia driver a snap without having to do the Debian package way (I'll still read up on it but I'd rather use the nVidia way...it seemed to work fine previously).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Looks like I'm way late here, but the easiest way I have found to get a good Debian install is with the net install CD (about 107-113MB). &nbsp;It can be downloaded from the Debian site. &nbsp;It installs a base systwem, then depending on what one wants (desktop O/S, server, database, or whatever) downloads and installs the rest. &nbsp;Broadband is a must<br /><br />I installled this system 31 Dec. came with KDE and Gnome (2.8) &amp; soon got an upgrade on KDE. &nbsp;Uses the Gnome login manager (gdm) to choose between GNOME and KDE, &nbsp;If gdm is not installed or gets removed it defaults to GNOME at startx command. &nbsp;I never got a system I could use from the &quot;Woody&quot; &nbsp;CDs: at best command-line only (&amp; I'm too ignorant for that) or GRUB would hang.<br /><br />Like others pointed out, the safest way to do Debian upgrades is &quot;smart upgrade&quot; with synaptic, or (at the command line) with apt-get update followed by apt-get distr-upgrade , as those routes seem to avoid dependency and/or incompatibility problems.</div>
