					Title: <b>Commercial Computer Classes</b><br />
					Post by: <b>rugmonster</b> on <b>July 11, 2006, 09:50:30 pm</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The past two summers, I&#039;ve gone to several commercial training classes that were geared toward certification exams. Last summer, I went to a Network+, 3 Microsoft MCSA and MCSE, and 3 Cisco CCNA/CCNP classes. This summer, so far, I&#039;ve been to the SANS Security Essentials class (aimed at the GIAC Security Essentials Certification), and currently in a Microsoft MCSE class. <br /><br />From what I found, the Microsoft classes all sucked hard. If the stuff that is in those classes is what you&#039;re tested on, I don&#039;t see how any MCSA or MCSE can say they know jack about real system administration or engineering. None of the examples or exercises apply to anything useful and even worse, they&#039;re so Microsoft-centric that had you no other experience, go with all of your routers, firewalls, proxies, VPN solutions, etc, etc running Microsoft stuff. I suppose that should go without saying, but still, no &quot;engineer&quot; in his right mind would drink that Kool-Aid. <br /><br />The Cisco classes on the other hand were pretty good. I felt like I learned quite a bit even though I&#039;ve had lots of experience with designing Cisco based networks and administering their routers and switches. While some parts seemed a little dated (really, who uses demand-dial routing these days), but for the most part, it was all good stuff. If for nothing else, information to put in your bag of tricks.<br /><br />The SANS GSEC class was pretty good, but a little thin. It covered a very broad scope of topics, but I was satisfied that it covered the up to date technologies as well as legacy issues. It covered concepts first and then some specifics. The one thing I wish it had gone more into was the details of some of the protection and auditing measures, but that&#039;s so broad and for a week long class, we were doing good to get through all we did. Seven very large books in six days was a lot of material to soak in.<br /><br />And oh yeah, the Network+ class. Like the Microsoft classes, while being vendor neutral, you really didn&#039;t learn enough about anything to do anything useful.<br /><br />So, what have your experiences been? When I do my Linux+ and CCDA later this year, I won&#039;t be paying money out of my own pocket to attend any classes. I&#039;ll go with the self study books and doing some practical exercises on my own, thank you very much.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve sat through a week long Linux+ class and I think I fell asleep more often than anything. For that class, if you had more than a few years Linux experience, you are probably more qualified than the instructor.... which was the case for the class I was in lol</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I too have been to several cert classes.&nbsp; I took enough of the Micro$oft classes to get my MCSE.&nbsp; (My military unit paid for it and sent me on temporary duty to attend...even tho&#039; most of them were in P&#039;cola!)&nbsp; The one thing I learned very quickly when taking the MS tests is that you need to teach your brain to think in &quot;Micro$oft&quot;...NOT how things are done in the real world.&nbsp; If you make that temporary switch, then I found the tests pretty easy.<br /><br />The courses that I <b>DID</b> get a lot out of were the ones to get my Oracle DBA.&nbsp; I like working with databases anyway, but they were just a lot of fun for me.&nbsp; It always helps when the instructors keep things interesting too!&nbsp; ;)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">IMO certs are good for a people (mostly technicians) who want to take a few classes, maybe pick up some skills, but don&#039;t want to bother with the hassle of getting a college degree.&nbsp; They often hold almost no value a few years down the road.&nbsp; You very quickly reach a point where you would be much better off enrolling in college, and seeking a degree than taking more than a handful of cert classes.&nbsp; From my experience, most employers put very little faith in certs in general, unless it&#039;s a professional expertise certification, i.e. P.E. for engineers.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You, sir, have missed the point of certifications completely. Rather than being a way to get a job to get experience that loses value over time, a certification should be attained once a person has experience with the material covered by the certification. The value of a certifcation held by someone with no experience is nil. As a person gains experience, if they are interested in maintaining certifications, they would need to upgrade their certifications to higher level certs. <br /><br />The statement that certs are for people who don&#039;t wish to go to college is completely false. Certifications are used to bolster education and experience on a resume as well as negotiate higher wages from current employers. Also, if employers didn&#039;t care about certs, then you wouldn&#039;t see them asking for them on job boards, nor would people spend the money and time to attain them. Some employers and certain positions may not put as much weight on certs, but for others, it is required. <br /><br />Devalued certs as I see them include A+, Network+, MCSA and MCSE, among others. Some of the more valued certs include CCNA, CCNP, CCIE (holy crap, can you say instant six figures?), CISSP (huge in SOX and HIPPA compliance areas), SANS Certs, Linux+ (amazingly, being asked for much more than LPIC).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">In the dev world, certs aren&#039;t viewed the same way as sys/network admin or the security area. Also, a cert that has nothing to do with a position you are applying for will mean diddly-squat. Finally, I agree whole heartedly that a bachelor&#039;s degree means a whole hell of a lot more than any one cert to an employer. I&#039;m well aware that once I start my job search to get out of the AF, I&#039;ll have a harder time than someone who has a bachelor&#039;s. I will have an associates and plan to have a decent portfolio of certs to go along with my (then) 8 years experience in sys/network admin. If I go up against someone with the same experience as me with a bachelor&#039;s degree, I probably won&#039;t get the job. Not only that, you are correct in that a college education does provide a broad understanding of concepts relating to a field. Specific knowledge of languages/products/environments comes from experience, but what sets the people who are really good at what they do and stand apart from the rest of the industry is an understanding of why things work the way they do and not just the fact that they work and how to make those specific things work. College isn&#039;t necessary for gaining that in depth knowledge, but it is certainly easier than the way I learned.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just wanted to brag for a second, but I just finished my second test for the SANS GSEC cert. Got a 95% on the first one and 96% on the second one. If I read the information on the GIAC site, that should qualify me for honors status. I&#039;m happy that I&#039;ve got that done. Time for me to move on to my CCNA. I&#039;ve been putting that one off for more than a year now. </div>
