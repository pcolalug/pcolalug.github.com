					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Lately, I&#039;ve been looking around for a motherboard that would make a good cheap (non-gaming) linux box.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d prefer something that had embedded intel video, and ac 97 audio.&nbsp; Those two chipsets seem to be very well supported under linux.&nbsp; Anyway, just out of curiosity I went on Dells website and I found a perfectly good little box for $250 on clearance! (&nbsp; http://www.dell.com/content/topics/segtopic.aspx/holiday_gifts?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs)<br />They also have a decent bundle for $450.<br /><br />I wonder though, would it be possible to build a cheaper/better box along those lines?&nbsp; It seems like a nice Christmas gift for the folks, but considering they&#039;re still stuck on dail up, I wonder how much use they&#039;d get out of it...<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Simple answer, no.<br /><br />Complex answer, maybe. It would be hard and you would be doing it with the absolute crappiest parts that it wouldn&#039;t be worth it. At least with this system, you can get hardware service and support, something that I&#039;ve found is incredibly useful for the folks.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Then again, with Dell hardware, if it falls out of warranty you can&#039;t find hardware for it (mobo or PSU at least....)<br /><br />If you want a crappy, cheap computer that you can replace parts on easily, and that uses more standard parts, your best bet is to go with an eMachine.&nbsp; Since they got bought by Gateway, they still suck, but they don&#039;t suck nearly as much.&nbsp; Though I&#039;d crack the case open and mod it so the hard drives lay flat instead of on their sides.&nbsp; They don&#039;t fail as fast that way.</div>
