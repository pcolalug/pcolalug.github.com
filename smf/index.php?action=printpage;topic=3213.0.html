					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks Chuck for mentioning it.<br /><br />We are strapping the house down and preparing for the rains to start later tonight. The eye is scheduled to pass a bit south of us now, but we will be getting the wind and rain for several hours. We are not at all concerned that our house will be structurally damaged. However, windows could be broken and I have been told that windows don&#039;t do much for stopping rain around here. Though these houses are armored plated, they are not water-proof. Since we have no need for heat and it is too expensive to air condition the whole house, the windows are just casually put in place to keep light rain out, but let sunshine in.<br /><br />I will update you when I can.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">We lived!<br /><br />We got quite a bit of heavy winds but no real rain to speak of. Fortunately the storm did not cause any deaths on this side of Mexico (we will know more about its second landfall tomorrow). There were many houses destroyed as well as businesses. An estimated 65,000 acres of agriculture was destroyed as well.<br /><br />Thanks once again for thinking about us. It could have been much worse had it not turned south to the less populated areas.</div>
