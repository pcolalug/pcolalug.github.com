Please share the collected info here on the forums. <br /></div><br /><br />Well......&nbsp; There were 6 people at the meeting, including me.&nbsp; We chewed the fat for a while and then discussed the backup solutions being used by those present.&nbsp; I handed out printed copies of my backup script and discussed it briefly.&nbsp; There was a short discussion also about monitoring/keylogging software. <br /><br />This was the first meeting I&#039;d been to in a while.&nbsp; I was hoping for something more.&nbsp; We talked about the past and future of the LUG, and how much it&#039;s changed since the &quot;glory days&quot;.&nbsp; I am still struggling to grasp why there isn&#039;t more interest and attendance, but cannot come up with the answers.&nbsp; We speculated that perhaps it&#039;s due to Linux being easier to use today than it was 3-4 years ago, and that folks don&#039;t need so much help from other users as we used to.&nbsp; I believe that is a big part of it, along with the vast amount of help/info that is now available on the internet.<br /><br />I wish we could generate some renewed interest and participation.&nbsp; We talked about possibly holding some sequential &quot;training&quot; classes about the basics/intro level stuff, to help new Linux users or potential converts make the transition from Windows.&nbsp; I think that would be a great idea, and would certainly be willing to help with presentations and events.&nbsp; I have quite a few presentations already done from years past, which could be dusted off and presented again.&nbsp; The sticking point to that idea is to actually get anyone to show up.&nbsp; We&#039;ve tried flyers posted around town before, with less than stellar results.&nbsp; Most other &quot;advertising&quot; would cost money.&nbsp; I honestly don&#039;t know how else we can &quot;get the word out&quot; and increase awareness and interest in using Linux/OSS.<br /><br />If anyone has ideas on how to do this, please share.&nbsp; Again, I would like to get re-involved with the LUG, but am not real interested in attending meetings where the same 4 people show up each time, and there&#039;s nothing beneficial to anyone being accomplished.&nbsp; If anyone else is willing to do anything to try and advance the LUG, please speak up.&nbsp; Now.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Dan<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would be more than happy to try and put some basic intro class material together. If we can get the rest of the group behind it this well may bring in some newbies to the Lug.<br />I can start next week putting together a series of 30 minute classes with a 15 minute Q&amp;A session. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think we need to make a course outline of what we will cover so everyone wishing to make a presentation won&#039;t duplicate what someone else is doing. It will also give us a chance to make progressively more advances topics as the students learn. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I agree with danc3 that we may need to re-think what our purpose and mission of the LUG is. I totally agree that there may not be as much need to lean on one another on a regular basis to get a Linux system up and running like there used to be. And I also see that as a good thing.<br /><br />With the great on-line resources available today and the ease at which one can learn to work with Linux, it makes the day-to-day hand holding less necessary. Linux is just getting easier. Yay!<br /><br />However, that makes us have to consider what our purpose is. What do we want to accomplish as a LUG? I have enjoyed the different topics and presentations at meetings. But with a specific topic, it may cause some people to be either intimidated by the subject or not see the need to attend. I think that will always cause members to evaluate whether a specific meeting is needful to them. Some of us attend every meeting possible regardless of the topic. But, not everyone can attend every meeting. As most of you know, I am one of those people. Fortunately, the schedule works out that I will be home for at least the next 2 and possibly the next 4 meetings. I am interested in banging out a direction with all of you before we have elections again. We can bring in the next administration with a new set of goals.<br /><br />There will always be new people that we can mentor and help along, like OlRedHair. We never want to neglect them. We were all there once.<br /><br />******Can we get someone who understands this forum software better than me to split this thread starting with danc3&#039;s comments about direction into a new thread?*******<br /><br />Thanks for splitting this out green_dragon37</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It&#039;s true that we need to figure out some way to breathe new life in to the LUG.&nbsp; I honestly find the meetings to often be very dry, I attend both out of habit, and for the conversation more than anything.&nbsp; I miss the LAN parties, there just wasn&#039;t enough attendance to justify keeping that going.&nbsp; It&#039;s more than needing something fun once in a while, too.<br /><br />Every meeting needs to engage the mind and keep the interest of both the old hat crowd, the people who can do the advanced stuff, and the new generation of people who are having no problem getting Linux installed with distributions that are designed with user friendliness first in mind.&nbsp; Perhaps we don&#039;t need <i>only</i> a &#039;newbie&#039; course.&nbsp; We still need more advanced topics covered to keep interest with the more experienced members.<br /><br />From what I&#039;ve seen, there also isn&#039;t a whole lot of interaction between the steering committee, and the general membership.&nbsp; Each meeting is just randomly tossed together these days, usually on a whim.&nbsp; We should strive to bring back that communication as well.&nbsp; We lost something big when that faded away.&nbsp; It&#039;s not that the steering committee isn&#039;t listening, either.&nbsp; If you make a post, we read it.&nbsp; There just aren&#039;t enough dialogues started, by anyone.&nbsp; We need to revive that, and the committee should lead the way.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have the answers, but I have ideas.&nbsp; Most of them revolve around getting people talking again, and trying to get past some of the animosity that was generated the past two years.&nbsp; Let&#039;s just be civil, because the opposite <i>never</i> helps.<br /><br />Ian</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The need for more discussion in the forums is true. I think the main thing that got us started as a strong group was the interaction on the forums. Again, I don&#039;t know that there is a lot of questions to be asked here that aren&#039;t already answered somewhere on the net. But it is a good point. We need to re-generate that excitement of finding something new to play with and sharing it with others through the forum.<br /><br />Historically we have looked at forum participation to be the barometer for how active the group is. Each member can jump into the forums and be active. It only takes starting a new topic to get the ball rolling.<br /><br />Thank you to those of you who have been providing news and information by way of the forums. Let&#039;s all jump in and do a little more.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I agree with what Ian said.&nbsp; Presentations lately seem be be a little dry.&nbsp; I personally attribute this to it being aimed more towards a business environment (backups, IEEE, VPN, etc...)&nbsp; and not towards the more casual desktop environment.<br /><br />In other words, we&#039;ve only been furthering the stereotype that linux is only good for servers and other network &quot;stuff.&quot;<br /><br />With that said, I&#039;d like to propose/volunteer to do a presentation regarding gaming on linux.&nbsp; This would help new members get their feet wet and if other members could bring their laptops we could set up a LAN as part of the demonstration.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sounds like a decent idea.&nbsp; I&#039;d probably show up for a gaming presentation with some LAN interaction.<br /><br />I also agree on some more &quot;desktop&quot; oriented presentations, rather than the &quot;dry&quot; stuff.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yossarian, you are officially on to present at the June meeting.<br /><br />Anyone can do a presentation. Just let me know what you would like to do and when you want to present. They do not need to be hour long speeches.<br /><br />Also, don&#039;t forget that if you have been playing with any new hardware or software and just want to do a quick explanation as to what it is, you are always welcome to speak up at a meeting. I have been trying to provide a specific time in the meetings for such topics.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for that info.&nbsp; I was referring to other folks (besides you, me, and dpeach) with my &quot;anybody else&quot; question...<br /><br />I&#039;m not familiar with all those games, but may give a look at them.&nbsp; I will likely have some FPS games (ET, RTCW, Q4, UT2K4) installed.&nbsp; Problem with playing them on a LAN is that you need a game server (which I used to bring to the LAN parties), but don&#039;t have any more.&nbsp; Regardless of whether we actually play any of them over a LAN, it will be interesting to see them demo&#039;d and to see the slideshow.<br /><br />Come on folks, let&#039;s see some more interest and participation in this!<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Good article, sandspur.&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken at least one suggestion from it and embraced Facebook.&nbsp; There&#039;s now a group (http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=88020407734) for the LUG.&nbsp; Also I&#039;ve posted our next meeting event to opendesktop.org (http://opendesktop.org/events/?id=40).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Great article. One thing it pointed out that may be really helpful in bringing in new folks is if we could have our meetings on campus at PJC or UWF. Anyone have connections? Have we tried this and hit a brick wall? In the back of my mind we have looked into this, but have been rebuffed. Can anyone think of a reason we would not want to move to one of the school campuses for our meetings?<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I personally like the current meeting location since it&#039;s relatively close to where I live.<br /><br />However, I&#039;m not opposed to possibly moving our meeting spot if it means more membership (I&#039;m usually on that side of town anyways on Thursdays).<br /><br />I&#039;ll continue trying to convince my more tech-savy friends to give linux a chance, but don&#039;t expect much to come out of that.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I also forgot to mention that I&#039;ve been in contact with the former president of the Computer Society of West Florida (http://www.cswf.net/ (http://www.cswf.net/)) , who happens to be a family friend.&nbsp; Apparently a one or two of their members were interested in Linux.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t heard much more from him.<br /><br />There is also a Panhandle Macintosh User Group (PMUG) that meets at PJC currently.&nbsp; Not sure if we have any mac users here that could help bridge the gap.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, the topic/thread has (predictably) petered out.&nbsp; I dunno.&nbsp; I did find an interesting article, that pretty much describes our LUG&#039;s past and present.&nbsp; I guess it isn&#039;t just us:<br /><br />http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/118046<br /><br />Not sure what we do from here.<br /><br /><br /></div>
