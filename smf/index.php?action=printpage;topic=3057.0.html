					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I found this book to be very well written and concise, though clearly intended for someone with some level of prior programming experience.&nbsp; My only real complaint is that some of the chapters, while covering a wide amount of material, seem to be lacking in depth.&nbsp; Aside from that, however, I found this book to be more than adequate to give a solid a foundation in Ruby, and after it serves as an extremely useful reference for the classes and modules that are built-in to Ruby.<br /><br />All in all, if you&#039;re interested in learning Ruby, this book should definitely be in your collection. 5 stars out of 5.<br /><br />(This review also posted to oreilly.com and barnesnoble.com)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Did the book cover programming Ruby in a Linux environment?  Is programming Ruby independent of the underlying O/S?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you&#039;re going to do web programming, the Ruby on Rails framework is the way to go if you&#039;re going with Ruby. That is the reason that section was so brief. </div>
