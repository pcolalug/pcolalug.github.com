					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Anyone with experience in .NET out there or know someone who does?&nbsp; There is at least one position available at Saufley Field for someone who can develop .NET applications.&nbsp; These folks are getting desperate for help.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know the salary ranges but can certainly find out more about it if you are interested.&nbsp; They&#039;ve been trying to fill this position for quite some time now, they just haven&#039;t been able to find anyone with experience.&nbsp; Send me an e-mail if you have any questions.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, the market pretty much sucks unless you want to work for little pay or in a hand full of places. I won&#039;t be moving back to the NWFL area after I get out of the AF because I know no one in town will pay me for my experience what I can get in other places with comparable and cheaper costs of living.<br /><br />PcolaGolfer, you may get a little more response if you give a little more information about the position (is it full-time W2, short or long term contract, etc) and some more specifics as to what aspect of .NET development they are looking for. Windows and ASP.NET application development, as well as the various other areas of .NET development, are very different between them. And while it mostly is assumed that most .NET development is done in C#, there are still other languages such as VB.NET and J# that fall under the .NET umbrella. While a competent developer/engineer should be able to transition from one to the other, it might be helpful to specify a little more as to what the candidate is expected to have experience with so they can tailor their resume and potentially give them a better feeling about the job.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That&#039;s funny, I&#039;m currently working out at saufley as a coop, and I&#039;ve been dying to get in some paid coding time.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thus far I&#039;ve only been involved in DBA stuff.&nbsp; I do have some limited experiennce in ASP.net, but I wouldn&#039;t call myself experienced. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Apparently, it is that hard to find experienced .NET developers...I know that they have had folks interview for this position but without in-depth .NET application development experience they don&#039;t get the nod.&nbsp; As for more specs rugmonster, I don&#039;t have all the details.&nbsp; I can find out more if anyone has a specific question.&nbsp; Here&#039;s what I do know:&nbsp; The job is full-time W2 with a subcontractor at Saufley Field working on the Navy&#039;s ILE project.&nbsp; Salary is DOE but should be in the $20 - $25 per hour range.&nbsp; They need someone with enough .NET experience to be able to hit the ground running with respect to building/creating new features for an existing .NET application.&nbsp; The management over there seems to be real picky on knowledge, skills, and abilities for interviewees.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, as an aside, there is now a position open for an Oracle Forms/Reports developer.&nbsp; Know anyone with this skillset?&nbsp; The pay is in the $50s...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Experience in .NET is what they are looking for out here.&nbsp; I am confident that a good programmer with VB, C#, or Java background can pull off the requirements of the position, but getting the managers who make selection decisions to understand that is near impossible.&nbsp; I&#039;m not telling anyone they should lie on their resume, but if you can speak intelligently to the topic and have the skillset/determination to get things done, sometimes adding a little icing is the only way to get a foot in the door.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are also some new positions available looking for web developers and such (see my latest post); if you&#039;re interested polish up your resume (focus on the skills sited in the job description) and forward it along.&nbsp; I&#039;ll do my best to get you an interview...</div>
