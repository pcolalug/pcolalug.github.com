					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey guys here&#039;s a good one!<br />Tech Advanced sold a young man a computer for 200.00....It has Linux installed. recent 2.6.21 kernel.<br />He is getting Mediacom Friday and needs somebody in the Pace area that could spare a couple of minutes to get him on the world wide web. He called me tonight (sent By Mr. Winters from the local computer tag) looking for the Linux support number for Linux thought I may know it. :(<br />Anyway should not take long and would be a good thing to get this young man up and running Linux and start his education.<br /><br />I have his name and phone number to coordinate this ...<br /><br />Any Takers?????</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don&#039;t see why anyone would need to go out there. Assuming the network card works (and it very likely does) it will almost certainly have DHCP enabled. He should be able to plug the thing in, open Firefox or whatever other browser is installed and be rocking and rolling.<br /><br />If someone wants to go out there, I&#039;m sure he would appreciate it, but it really shouldn&#039;t be that hard.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Anybody that calls you up looking for the 800 number for Linux is bound to have issues.<br />I can not believe they sold a computer to someone without something to go with it.<br />And presently it does not have a nic card he is installing it as I write this.<br />Since it has been 24 hours I guess I will drive over this weekend!!!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would have thought the motherboard would at least have a nic built into it. It seems most do these days, even the cheap ones. I&#039;m surprised Tech Advanced sells linux computers. Good for them.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Actually I think tech advance did wrong here.<br />First where do you find a computer from a retail store for 200 and yea who does not have a nic and has a modem.<br />I think they must have sold him a used junker somebody turned in or something and then again maybe he did not get it from them.<br />Either way I wish the Young man luck! I was unable to get over there in a timely manner so I hope that the phone help I gave him got him going in the right direction.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yeah, Tech Advanced should not be selling any computers that don&#039;t have some kind of network connector. You might be right that it was some kind of junker. It doesn&#039;t help the Linux cause at all if someone sells a computer and the user can&#039;t even connect to the internet with it. They&#039;ll blame Linux instead of the computer dealer. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;d be interested to hear how he made out with the network connection, and I&#039;d love to see him at a LUG meeting. :)</div>
