					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Posted on behalf of Nathan Wheeler:<br /><br />Learning C#, by Jesse Liberty, provides an excellent way to build up a solid foundation in C#. &nbsp;I found that the topics are covered in a clear concise manner that can help either a beginning of experienced programmer who is faced with the task of learning a new language. &nbsp;Being familiar with basic object-oriented concepts in C++, I found this book to be an easy way to learn the new methodology of C#.<br /><br />Learning C# provides an introduction to most if not all of the fundamentals of C# including: variables, loops, conditions, classes and objects (of course), arrays and collections, inheritance, polymorphism, etc. &nbsp;While introducing each topic and explaining it the author provides a copious number of examples. &nbsp;These examples then build on each other illustrating the way the concept are intertwined. &nbsp;In addition, after each listing the author reiterates how and why it works and often provides notes on how to avoid common pitfalls associated with it.<br /><br />Although the chapters build on each other, they are written so that an experienced programmer can skim over the topics he understands and focus on the more important issues like how the subject is actually implemented in C#. &nbsp;In addition, the Visual Studio .NET IDE is introduced and the reader is walked through the building of a number of simple projects in Visual Studio .NET and its debugger and compiler. &nbsp;Although I found some of the beginning chapters very simplistic I appreciated the more advanced topics covered in the later half of the book. &nbsp;Through reading Learning C# I was able to pickup enough of the language to feel comfortable tackling a number of programming projects that I had formally resigned to code in C++. <br /><br />In all I think Learning C# provides a quick easy way to learn the basics of C# and build a foundation for more advanced challenges like Windows and web applications</div>
