					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Why would you get a nforce4 SLI capable motherboard without getting at least a SLI capable video card? I run a Radeon under Linux and as much as I hate to admit it, the Nvidia drivers are so much better. Will it work? Sure, but I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll get the same performance as you would with an Nvidia card. For not a lot more, you can get a faster processor too. Just make sure it is socket 939 in case you want to jump to dual core down the road.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You do have some OEM choices too, I dunno how their prices compare to do-it-yourself though.&nbsp; Dell offers open-source desktops:<br />http://www1.us.dell.com/content/topics/segtopic.aspx/e510_nseries?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;~ck=mn<br /><br />Also Sun has some Opteron systems starting at $895, but you&#039;d want to replace the video card with a gaming card:<br />http://store.sun.com/CMTemplate/CEServlet?process=SunStore&amp;cmdViewProduct_CP&amp;catid=131490<br /><br />Nick</div>

Few months [7] down the road, I&#039;ll buy a snazzy SLI capable card that&#039;ll burn a hole in my pocket.<br /><br /><br />To imnes: <br /><br />Dell, to me, is what you linux users think of Windows -- You hate it, but you gotta learn to live with it being around you.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here (http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.asp?Manufactory=1028&amp;PropertyCodeValue=0&amp;PropertyCodeValue=517%3A7439&amp;PropertyCodeValue=0&amp;PropertyCodeValue=0&amp;PropertyCodeValue=0&amp;PropertyCodeValue=0&amp;PropertyCodeValue=0&amp;PropertyCodeValue=0&amp;PropertyCodeValue=0&amp;PropertyCodeValue=0&amp;PropertyCodeValue=0&amp;description=&amp;MinPrice=&amp;MaxPrice=&amp;SubCategory=343&amp;Submit=Property) is a search to try...<br /><br /><br />For $20 more, you can move up to a 3500 Venice (2.2 Ghz). From there it jumps to over $250 for a processor.<br /><br />Also, here is a Geforce 6800GT, SLI capable.<br />http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814135171<br /><br />That is $283 that you pay for now and then pay a little less a little ways down the road to get a full SLI setup. If you get an ATI card, to use SLI, you would have to buy two more video cards. That doesn&#039;t make any sense monetarily. <br /><br />You asked for our opinions. You can&#039;t go and get defensive. Also, keep in mind that you are asking on a Linux board and we are going to give you the best inputs we can with Linux in mind. When comparing Radeon to Nvidia, Nvidia wins for driver support and considering your hardware is only as good as your driver, I would go with Nvidia had I to do it over again.</div>
