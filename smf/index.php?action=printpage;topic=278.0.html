					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just scored a small computer off eBay for $150. &nbsp;It's decent, 450mhz AMD K6/2, 256mb PC100 ram, 20gb ATA hard drive, cd-rom, floppy, sound, ethernet, and TV-Out. &nbsp;I might add an NVidia GeForce 4 pci card to it for 3D. &nbsp;Should be fun. &nbsp;I'm gonna set it up as a portable coding / gaming machine with XWindows and Linux. &nbsp;Supposedly it can be clocked at 600mhz without problems, we'll find out when it shows up. &nbsp;If it works well enough I might bring it to the gaming meeting instead of lugging my big tower computer over.<br /><br />(http://home.attbi.com/~otterburn02/netier.jpg)<br /><br />I'll let you know how it works out when it shows up.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yes, it just showed up. &nbsp;It's &nbsp;actually a nice little system. &nbsp;I haven't had much time to play with it yet. &nbsp;One idea I'm kicking around is installing the linux infrared control project, I've got an extra remote I can use on it to control xmms and other stuff remotely. &nbsp;I also have a remote kb+mouse for it, and usb joystick adapter so I can use my steering wheel / joystick for gaming on it. &nbsp;I'm on the hunt for a good 3d card with tv-out now, preferrably an nvidia, but we'll see.<br /><br />I've been so busy with school and finals that I haven't really played with it much. &nbsp;But hopefully I'll have time now.<br /><br />I finally got a chance to rebuild my router today, that's why all my pics aren't showing up right now, I hope to get everything back online tomrrow.<br /><br />Nick</div>
