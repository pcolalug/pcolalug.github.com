					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey all,<br /><br />I've noticed something pecular with kde and mc. &nbsp;They do not seem to want to write to non native file systems. &nbsp;I know what your going to say, &quot;it's not mounted read-write&quot; or &quot;normal users don't have permission to write to a mounted file system&quot;. &nbsp;I assure you, it's rw, and I'm root. &nbsp;However, using cp actually works. &nbsp;Not only that, but mc can actually corrupt a fat32 file system just trying.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yup, kde is funky about allowing write access to mounted file systems too.<br /><br />I have to think it's some sort of inbuilt protection, despite the fact the mount was done manually in read write mode.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Read. &nbsp;I ment &quot;too&quot; as not excluding kde. &nbsp;:roll: <br /><br />I've just about always manually mounted my stuff, and I don't remember having this problem. &nbsp;Personally I don't think konqueror should care how a volume was mounted. &nbsp;<br /><br />A buddy of mine (link_z_ro) runs mepis. &nbsp;It automagically mounts floppies, and his usb sticks ro. &nbsp; I guided him through the steps of manually unmounting and remounting the drive rw. &nbsp;(We've used the mount rw option within the kde menu). No dice. &nbsp; When an OS deems to do something for me, it better do it right, or at least let me easily change it.</div>
