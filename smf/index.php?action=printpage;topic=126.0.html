					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've talked it &nbsp;over with David and Steve and I propose to create a mod for phpBB that will allow us to interact with our &quot;library&quot; via these forums. &nbsp;So far the specs are as follows:<br /><br />phpBBLibrary_Mod would be a mod to phpBB, implemented as a new forum type,Library, and some associated additions to the admin console and user<br />priveleges.<br /><br />1. use amazon api to tie isbn to image, title, description, link to amazon<br />2. users allowed to use library can check out materials that are available,<br />get on a waiting list if they are not, and see what they have and when its<br />due back. Can optionally receive reminders when something is due. Users with overdue materials cannot check out additional materials.<br />3. Admins can configure who uses the library, how long things are kept, how<br />and how often reminders are sent to users about returning/overdue materials.<br />4. Librarian (Library moderator) will confirm that each trasaction (check in<br />and out) actually took place before committing to the library.<br />5. Librarian can see at a glance what is due back and when and by who. Can optionally recieve periodic reminders when due dates are close.<br />6. Catalog can be broken into categories to ease browsing/searching. &nbsp;Books may, however, appear in multiple catagories.<br /><br />This thread is for you to post comments, sugguestions, and feature requests, as well as chime in if you want to lend a hand. &nbsp;I tentatively plan to have this thread up for a week or so, after which time we'll have a feature freeze and start designing and coding the monster.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'll have to check and see if they have something similar, but I don't believe that they do. &nbsp;BAM is still a storefront kind of thing, where Amazon has the motivation and need to build such a thing.<br /><br />Here (http://associates.amazon.com/exec/panama/associates/ntg/browse/-/1067662/ref=gw_hp_ls_1_3/) is a bit about what Amazon's Web Services API does, if anyone is interested.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi all, I'm sorry that I've been a bit scarce, lately. &nbsp;Real Life(tm) had gotten the better of me the last couple of weeks. &nbsp;Things have calmed down, and I am fresh from a weekend off playing the (Linux native) Unreal Tournament 2003 Demo. &nbsp;I plan to update the library status page tonight (see previous post). &nbsp;Again, anyone who whould like to contribute, feel free. &nbsp;I can see about setting up a CVS and test server this weekend.<br /><br />Update: Cable modem's on the fritz again. &nbsp;I will try and update the site again tonight.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Update:<br /><br />Okay folks, there's basically no documentation on coding for PHPBB. &nbsp;It involves digging through source and samples and just figuring stuff out. &nbsp;So this isn't gonna be so simple, but the api looks very straightforward so hopefully it's not too much of a nightmare.<br /><br />The one thing I don't like is adding modifications to phpbb sites requires the site admin manually editing PHP scripts to incorporate the new features. &nbsp;That's an awful way for you to have to do it but I guess it works.<br /><br />I got most of the planning for the app done and hopefully can start actually coding this week (if I don't get swamped with <i>other</i> work.) <br /><br />I'll keep you updated on here.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Not to throw a wrench into this but do you think it would be easier to code this outside of PHPbb and just put a link to it from the main web page and inside the forum? Rather than hacking PHPbb it could be easier to do the library as a stand alone interface with a SQL backend.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That would be so much easier. &nbsp;The only thing is people would basically have to register for that in addition to the phpbb forums. &nbsp;Not too big a deal but kind of annoying. <br /><br />Might end up going that route but give me some time to play around with the phpbb2 side of things and see if I can work it out.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I can do that but I probably need to go through phpbb's database abstraction layer. &nbsp;It looks easy enough, just because I don't know if the version of sql I use and whatever the pcolalug server uses is the same. &nbsp;I was using PostGreSQL but I think slackware came with MySQL3 so that's probably what I'll be using. &nbsp;<br /><br />Another problem with coding straight from their database is if you ever update the forum software and they've changed the database layout (which they warn that they do from time to time) then it will break all of my code.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The library is coming along. &nbsp;I'm keeping it completely seperate from the PHPBB2 code for several reasons but most of all it just makes life easier.<br /><br />Working on it on my own server right now it won't get posted here until it's done. &nbsp;If anyone's curious here's an update on what's happening.<br /><br />I estimate it's about half way complete, maybe a little less. &nbsp;The login system is fully functional, you can create accounts, fix lost passwords, update profiles (not complete yet), add books and reviews.<br /><br />It's almost completely plain text at the moment except for the logo. &nbsp;Might make all the buttons graphical but that won't come until everything else is finished. <br /><br />You can have a look if you want: http://www.homeweb.org/~imnes/library/<br /><br />If the search/browse books was functional you could find this page - it's a detailed view of a book in the library: http://www.homeweb.org/~imnes/library/bookview.php?isbn=0596000081<br /><br />Nick<br />imnes@go.com</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I was going through a textbook on developing internet applications. &nbsp;One of the first exercises is to build an app that given an ISBN will query multiple sites for detailed information about the book as well as current pricing, whether it's in stock or not, and present the information in a table. &nbsp;Here's what I came up with. &nbsp;It was actually easier than I thought it would be, and it wouldn't be terribly difficult to add parts of this to the library so that it can file new books itself without the user having to input all the data. &nbsp;Let me know if someone wants to tackle hacking this feature into it, otherwise I'll work on it when I get a chance. &nbsp;A little demo and the source code is at:<br /><br />http://www.homeweb.org/~imnes/basics/books/<br /><br />Nick<br /><br />UPDATE: I already added this, the msg about it is on the next page of this thread.</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I went ahead and added the capability to the library. &nbsp;Now when you input an ISBN number of a new book, it attempts to pull in all the information it needs (except for the Category since that's specific to our library) from the Books-A-Million server. &nbsp;If the book isn't cataloged by them or doesn't have an ISBN you will still have to enter all the information manually.<br /><br />It will pull in the info from books a million and give you an opportunity to change anything you like before adding the book. &nbsp;Otherwise it still operates the same as before. &nbsp;Give it a try, let me know if you encounter difficulties. &nbsp;<br /><br />Ultimately this should be changed over to the XML API that Amazon.com provides. &nbsp;Since this relies on the way information is presented on the BAM pages, if they change the wording much this feature would break. &nbsp;I may tackle the amazon stuff later when I know something about XML. &nbsp;If you are an XML guru feel free to take on this project yourself.<br /><br />BTW: Those of you who would like to &nbsp;test drive it without worrying about screwing up the lug's version, you can play around on my local dev copy at<br />http://www.homeweb.org/~imnes/library/<br />Feel free to make an account, add new categories and books. &nbsp;Fill it up with whatever you want I can clear the database out easily if it gets messed up (on MY copy not the LUG's copy!!!) &nbsp;Just a hint - I have debugging features turned ON on my server so you may see error messages and warnings even though the site works fine, please ignore them :)<br /><br /><br /><br />Also - Steve I've made some changes to the software directly on your server and I'm not sure how that copy differ's from mine now. &nbsp;Please tar.gz a copy of the entire /library directory and put it somewhere I can download it so that I'll have my versions in sync again! &nbsp;Basicall from a console, if the library is in ./library you would do something like<br /><br />tar -cf library-20030315.tar ./library/<br /><br />and then<br /><br />gzip library-20030315.tar<br /><br />And give me the resulting library-20030315.tar.gz<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br /><br />As far as what's next to work on - the search and browse pages should be enhanced. &nbsp;The search feature should be smarter and able to search for multiple terms in any order. &nbsp;The browse & search pages should be broken down and made to display only 20 results per page, with Prev / Next page buttons. &nbsp;This isn't gonna be needed for a while, at least not until we have more than say 50 books in this thing.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay people as you're using the library keep an eye out for this oddity. &nbsp;Quote marks &quot; and apostraphes ' showing up with a backslash in front of them \&quot; or \'. &nbsp;This is a side-effect of PHP + MySQL. &nbsp;I have to use a function called addslashes when inserting information into the database, but I forgot to use the corresponding stripslashes function when displaying that data on a web page. &nbsp;I didn't catch this when I was testing but saw it once some other members posted books. &nbsp;I've made the changes on a few pages but let me know the URL of the pages that still need to be fixed as you notice them, just post the URL to here please.<br /><br />Nick</div>
