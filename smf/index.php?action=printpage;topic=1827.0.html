					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have not run WinXP, but I don´t have problems with my Win 2000 install or Windows 98. Of course the 2000 hasn´t given me any problems since I have not booted into that for about 1 1/2 years. :D <br /><br />Win98 (SE), I am running SpyBot and AdAware on occasion. Never have any problems. I use Firefox as my browser. I guess 98 did a better job of turning off IE if you were not using it.<br /><br />No solutions to offer since I have no XP experience.</div>

That was mistake number one.<br /><br />However, I use Windows XP/2000 at my full time job and my part time job as well as one of my three computers at home. I don't get &quot;ANY POPUPS at all&quot; and I'm using IE. I do use FireFox primarily at work but also use IE when dealing with customer issues. And I use IE exclusively at my full time job. I don't have any popup blocker running but I did install Spybot on my home system and ran the immunize process in Spybot to protect IE. <br /><br />People don't understand spyware programs like spybot and adaware don't work like anti-virus programs. They aren't normally memory resident and don't actually protect live spyware from infecting your system. (SpySweeper does do this, though) SpyBot requires that you click on some buttons, or in the latest version during the install to setup IE to block a lot of the spyware.<br /><br />What 99% of it comes down to is where you spend your surfing time. I don't live on gaming sites, but when I do I make it a point to use Firefox. Once Windows gets a trojan or spyware on it, you'll be fighting a losing battle until it's all cleaned out.<br /><br />Anyway, while Windows, by default, is more vulnerable to &quot;Windows Attacks&quot; it all comes down to how you use it and the time you take to secure it/protect it. I look at it like a Linux user always logging on as &quot;root&quot;. That's not a smart move. You're asking for trouble. The same thing goes for Windows except, because of the number of dangerous programs targeting windows, it's 10 time more dangerous. If, like Linux, someone took the time to RTFM, read the security documents, and learn to use their OS correctly they wouldn't have 90% of the problems people complain about.<br /><br />Just to wrap up, a couple of facts:<br />1. &nbsp;I've been running and using Windows systems pretty much exclusively since Windows 95 was released.<br /><br />2. I have never had a michine infected by a virus. (My scanner has caught a few, but never has the system been damaged/infected)<br /><br />3. My Windows system has never crashed unless it was due to a hack that I was playing with or someone elses poorly written program. 9 times out of 10 if I'd taken the time to visit the programmers web site before installing, I'd have found a patch to fix the bug.<br /><br />4. My Windows system has never been hacked. (As far as I know. And of course, my linux system has never been hacked as far as I know)<br /><br />Finally if you think about it, It's not Windows that's bad. It's all of the bad software that targets it. (Try this, Install Windows on a machine. Do not connect it to the Internet or install any software. I bet you that unless you have a hardware failure or try to hack something, it will last as long as the computer. The same thing holds true for Linux.)<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yeah all those windows are in IE. &nbsp;I'm guessing some software that I've installed is using IE embedded, or maybe even something I've installed has installed all this junk? &nbsp;Everything I've loaded is edonkey p2p, roxio dvd creator, windows media player 10 beta, spybot, adaware, hijackthis, folding@home, gaim, firefox, powerarchiver, doom3, enemy territory, staroffice.<br /><br />If it came in through one of these programs my first bet would be edonkey.<br /><br />That little dog in the taskbar, not sure what the heck that is. &nbsp;I uninstall and it just comes back. &nbsp; On the mouse-hover caption it just says &quot;CashBach pays you to shop!&quot;<br /><br />So far still not able to get rid of everything. &nbsp;I have spybot search&amp;destroy on and it shows me whenever something modifies the registry. &nbsp;Adaware see's some of this stuff, tries to remove it, then somehow the things rewrite themselves in different registry locations. &nbsp;Fun.<br /><br />grrr, kinda sucks.</div>

Get HijackThis &nbsp;(http://www.spychecker.com/program/hijackthis.html)and it will remove the doggy. You definitely have some spyware on there. Here's how to get rid of most of it. Also get cwshredder (http://aumha.org/freeware/freeware.htm) and run it. It will stop ceertain programs from grabbing your home page.<br /><br />1. Right Click on My computer and click on Properties. Click on the System Restore Taband then turn off the system Restore. This will prevent Spyware from hiding in the system restore points while you're removing it. (Note: for those that don't like Windows, MS puts in system restore points for those software manufacturers that totally screw up the system when you install their software. This give you a good point to roll back to. Pretty smart, I think. I wish Linux had something like this so when I throw all kinds of trash in the system when doing a make/make install, I have a way to back out and get back to where it was when I started.)<br /><br />2. Reboot and using the F8 key while booting, go into safe mode.<br /><br />3. Find all temp directories and delete all files in them. Normally C:\Temp, C:\windows\Temp. Also delete everything in c:\windows\prefetch and c:\windows\Temporary Internet Files.<br /><br />4. While in Safe mode run up Spybot and do a complete scan and remove. Make sure to have it check for updates.. (Only connect the computer to the network while checking for updates. Leave it disconnected until clean for everything else. <br /><br />5. While in Safe mode run AdAware and do the same thing as with Spybot. (By default Adaware doesn't usually delete the spyware it only quarantines it. Make sure to delete it.)<br /><br />6. Continue running 4 and 5 until they come up empty.<br /><br />7. Run msconfig and go to the startup tab. Uncheck anything that you don't want to run when you startup. If unsure, google it.<br /><br />8. Reboot the computer and hook it up to the network.<br /><br />9. Go to Trendmicro (http://housecall.trendmicro.com/housecall/start_corp.asp) and run their on-line virus scanner. It's pretty good. (Run it until it doesn't find any infections)<br /><br />If problems persist you can take it to Best Buy for a complete cleanup.<br /><br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I read the last reply this morning and gave this whole thread some thought throughout the day. I finally came to the conclusion that IMHO a Linux board is not the place to discuss the pros and cons of Windows. <br /><br />Rather it is a place to discuss the pros and cons of Linux and it's applications. There are a lot more Windows knowledgable people than me hanging out in the Windows forums and boards. That would probably be the best place to discuss it's short comings. Here, being Linux users we are probably less familiar with Windows than some of the people on those boards.<br /><br />So, with that in mind, I've decided to &quot;try&quot; to keep my future posts in this board on the topic of Linux and not Windows.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The thing about linux and windows vulnerabilities and exploitations is this. Most of the exploits people use are for flaws people have known about and patches have been available for quite some time. Granted, Microsoft does lag behind due to their release schedule of once a month or so, but in that aspect, Linux is harder to stay up to date on. Automatic Update, as much as I hate it, automates the process of installing security updates for the OS. This does not include the server software, but it definitely takes a big chunk of effort out of the life of an admin if they use it. The biggest thing is that people need to realize to keep their software updated and to be smart about how things are run. I've never had a virus in my life, don't run antivirus software, been very lucky on being able to uninstall or prevent the install of spyware and adware and have never had a system compromised. I believe it is all in how you use your systems. They all have vulnerabilities, but it's up to the person running the system to minimize their risks while on the big bad internet.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have two Windows 2000 servers in the rack. They both run 24/7, connected to the internet, one has IIS running with 3 websites, and the other is strictly a file share/domain controller. The DC was put into service in 2001, and the IIS server (with FP Extensions) was installed in 2003. Neither have virus protection, but both use automatic updates to stay current on the patches. Both machines are just as stable as the two linux servers, and my OpenBSD firewall. The reason is, I beleive, is that I don't login to the servers unless I absolutely have to (such as to modifiy my internal DNS or work with AD), and I don't install any 3rd party software with the exception of VNC.<br /><br />That said, my conclusion is Windows is as stable as you make it. Working interactively/installing software can be the equivalent of removing the lug nuts off you your car - it'll work for awhile, put expect it to crash soon.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've been using Windows XP until I can get Mandrake 10 up on the internet.....very soon.<br /><br />I've not had any problem at all with pop-ups. &nbsp;I use AdAware, Spybot, Spyware, ZoneAlarm, and Norton Systemworks. &nbsp;I use FireFox web browser, and perhaps the kicker....which has made it successful more than anything else is that upon installing Windows XP on my system, ( home built computer ) is that I immediately uninstalled Internet Explorer.<br /><br />maybe that has nothing to do with it......but I have no pop-up problem at all.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The thing that is bad about Windows is that you do have to worry about spyware/adware. Granted, it can, in theory, be geared toward linux, it's definitely harder to slip a program install past Firefox or any other browser besides IE. ActiveX on IE is the worst point of vulnerability when it comes to general surfing of the web. The majority of your spyware/adware comes from there unless you are using Kazaa, Exeem or downloading warez. The thing that irritates me is that I <b>have</b> to use AdAware and SpyBot for the few times that I do use IE.</div>
