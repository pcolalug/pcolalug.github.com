					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Since this was posted 3 days ago and no one is screaming about it, I will play the game too.<br /><br />I have signed up for altomo. If you get enough to get your iPod, let us know so that others can sign up for me.<br /><br />My link to get credit is: http://www.freeiPods.com/default.aspx?referer=6811406<br /><br />I just need 5 to play the game.<br /><br />Maybe we can get enough signed up in the group to get us a few of these.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Anybody see the commercial for the new BMWs with the iPod interface on the stereos? &nbsp;You can control the ipod with buttons on the steering wheel, very slick.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have not seen the commercials on that. Stuff like that makes me say &quot;that's cool, I won't buy it.&quot; I think it is neat, and I really like the idea, but I hate being locked into a specific system. I have a friend that has a Sony notebook with a MemoryStick port. Also a Clie handheld. And a Sony camera. Though it is great to be able to switch memory among all the devices, I don't like feeling as though I have to buy a Sony camera just because I own the other two. If I use SD media, I can choose a host of handeld/camera/notebook combos.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the discussion. If you are at all interested in your geneology, I would give Ancestry.com a try. BTW, you can choose from a list of services to sign up for, not just ancestry.<br /><br />Ancestry.com has alot of information. Though most of what I found was posted by my uncle on their site, I did get some further information when I went to cancel. The guy I talked with to cancel my subscription did a search into some databases that are not available through the trial subscription. He didn't turn up any new names in my family, but he was able to fill in some missing dates.<br /><br />David Pietsch</div>
