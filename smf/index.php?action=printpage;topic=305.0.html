					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sweet, sweet, sweet!<br /><br />It's so nice to see a big game manufacturer produce a mainstream Linux port of a game; especially one as good as Neverwinter Nights! For those of you who may not have played it (and why haven't you?), it is an RPG set in the Dungeons and Dragons universe's Swordcoast; the same place Baldurs Gate was set. I have played it some out here with the Windows client, but now it seems that Bioware (http://www.bioware.com) is actually making a Linux client (http://nwn.bioware.com/downloads/linuxclient.html)! <br /><br />It is still being worked on because of complications with the movie and sound back-ends that the original client used, but is expected to be released sometime early next year (right around the corner). Being a recovering MMORPG addict, this is the first linear RPG that has really impressed me since my Evercrack days. I highly recommend it, and there isn't as much of an addiction factor. If you don't know about this game, you should at least go check it out at http://nwn.bioware.com/ (http://nwn.bioware.com/).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">A little background. Bioware promised the Linux client would be released with the Windows version. Many folks pre-ordered on this basis and were sorely (and vocally, if you'd like to check out the NWN forums) disappointed when this didn't happen. They threw us a bone about 6 months ago with their Linux download page and promised the Linux client would be released by Fall. Things happen, I understand, and I give 'em props for continuing work, but I wonder at the response from Linux users once this thing does come out. Many reviews were less than flattering. Some folks are even retracting some of their praise. So now, because of delays and miscommunication, we are looking at another case where folks can point and say &quot;See! Linux folks aren't interested in games!&quot; when this thing doesn't go over in the Linux world.</div>
