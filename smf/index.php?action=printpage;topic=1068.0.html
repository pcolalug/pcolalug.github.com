					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, got it installed, and posting from it now. &nbsp;So far things look great, although I've got a fair amount of configuring left to do.<br /><br />Couple of problems noted:<br />1. &nbsp;The kernel-sources are not included on the distro CD's this time. &nbsp;No real biggie there, but it's not available anywhere on the net either, that I can find. &nbsp;The version is 2.4.22-10mdk. &nbsp;This means that the Nvidia driver cannot be installed, and that is a problem for me (openGL gaming won't work). &nbsp;Tried the stock 2.4.22 source but the Nvidia installer doesn't like it (which I expected). &nbsp;Hopefully it'll show up somewhere soon.<br /><br />2. &nbsp;Mozilla 1.4 - when trying to go through the options/preferences, when there are multiple checkboxes/radio buttons on a section, they appear to all be selected at the same time! &nbsp;Very much a problem. &nbsp;Any clues?<br /><br />More later as I find it...<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hate to be a GPL whore, but if you can't get the source to Mandrake's kernel, they are in violation of the GPL. I don't think that this is the case, since Mandrake is such a good citezen and all, but you really ought to be able to get your kernel sources somehow.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Download a browser. Get Firebird (http://www.mozilla.org).<br /><br />I used to be a Mozilla Evangelist till Phoenix/Firebird came out. I am interested in a browser only, not all the extra junk. If you cannot get Mozilla working, then no big loss, just use Firebird. :lol: <br /><br />Glad to hear other than that the install went well. I have a friend trying to download it here, but for some reason, all the servers are full.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Update: &nbsp;Finally found the kernel source on some obscure mirror. &nbsp;Not sure why it isn't available on the Mandrake site itself, but maybe it will be later... &nbsp;That solves the Nvidia driver, works great.<br /><br />Also narrowed the checkboxes/buttons problem in Mozilla to be theme-specific. &nbsp;In the Default theme, it sucks, but in the Modern theme it works fine. &nbsp;Also got Java and Flash plugins installed, which is always fun.<br /><br />For David - I would use Firebird, except the fonts look like crap. &nbsp;Anyone know where to get a XFT version of 0.7?<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">All right, got an XFT-enabled Firebird running, and it is nice. &nbsp;I like the bookmarks handling better (than in Mozilla), and it *might* be a little faster.<br /><br />One (fairly major) issue I have with Firebird is this: &nbsp;When there is a &quot;mailto&quot; link on a web page, clicking it results in an error message something like &quot;mailto: not a registered protocol&quot;, and you can't email someone from the web page. &nbsp;I remember that Mozilla was like this too, if you didn't have Mozilla Mail installed. &nbsp;If you install Mozilla Mail, then Mozilla will use that when a &quot;mailto&quot; link is clicked. &nbsp;But, Firebird does not work this way. &nbsp;I don't see an option available to specify an email client to use. &nbsp;This is enough to keep me from using this browser. &nbsp;Anybody know a solution? &nbsp;TIA.<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Another update on my impressions with 9.2...<br /><br />1. &nbsp;Gnome 2.4 doesn't really seem any different than 2.2.<br />2. &nbsp;Can't get UT2003 to install. &nbsp;The installer starts fine, and then waits for me to accept the license agreeement, which does not appear on my screen, so I'm stuck. &nbsp;No idea why, might be a glibc difference between 9.1/9.2 which breaks the installer script?<br />3. &nbsp;Some 9.1 packages won't install (dependency problems). &nbsp;Normally this would be auto-solved by URPMI, but the 9.2 URPMI sources don't seem to be working. &nbsp;This means that newest versions of some things aren't available. &nbsp;I expect this will improve as mirrors catch up and 9.2 packages are made.<br /><br />4. &nbsp;A somewhat related issue for you other Mandrake users: &nbsp;Did you hear that Texstar is taking an extended break from making RPM's? &nbsp;For those of you who don't know, this guy was great for providing updated packages, even before Mandrake. &nbsp;This is a serious setback for Mandrake users.<br /><br />Overall I'm not all that pleased with this release. &nbsp;In fact I'm thinking about going back to 9.1, at least for a while. &nbsp;Mostly things just worked better for me with that version. &nbsp;Gonna think about it through the weekend. &nbsp;<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">About Firebird and mailto links. I remember I used to have this problem, but don't now. (I am using Windows right now due to not being able to get on the net in Linux with my notebook without a LAN connection, so I can try it this next week in Linux).<br /><br />I am currently using Thunderbird mail as my mail client. And it works fine. I don't remember if it worked with OE or not. Thunderbird may be the answer to having Firebird work correctly. But, as much as I like Thunderbird as a whole there are some things that I think might keep people from using it at the moment.<br /><br />I love the way it handles multiple accounts, but this is seen as one of it's weaknesses. Each account has it's own set of folders (Inbox, Sent, Deleted, etc.). For me that is great. I can have one user profile set up and have different accounts for my wife, son and myself. Each one of us can just select their account from the list on the left and see all of their own mail. With OE, I had each person's mail highlighted with a different color because OE just dumps everyone's mail into one folder (ie: one Inbox, Sent, Deleted, etc. for everyone). But you still had to dig through someone else's mail to find yours. <br /><br />Therefore, I like the multiple accounts being separate. But that is one of the complaints that others don't like. It should be an option to handle it one way or the other instead of making you use it just one way. For those who think this way, I would say that OE does not give you a choice either. Both clients will let you set it up the other way, but only by going through message rules and telling everything where you want it to go. So it can be tweaked to play the way you want. To me, I like the way Thunderbird does it.<br /><br />That is way off topic, but it does answer the question about Firebird and mailto links (at least for Windows at the moment).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ahhh, OK David I see what you meant now. &nbsp;Unfortunately I don't want to use Thunderbird as I'm too fond of Evolution...<br /><br />Anyway, for another update on my 9.2 travels... &nbsp;I've decided I don't like it. &nbsp;Cannot install UT2003, the fonts don't look right, and couldn't get K3b CD burner to work. &nbsp;<br /><br />So, I've reinstalled 9.1...<br /><br />And now have more problems. &nbsp;It seems that all the update source mirrors (for URPMI) are down. &nbsp;Yes, ALL of them. &nbsp;From what I can gather on various forums, many others are having this problem too, and there has been no good explanation given. &nbsp;This means that you can't get any security updates, and/or package version upgrades. &nbsp;Extremely irritating. &nbsp;Does anyone here know anything about this?<br /><br />A-not-so-happy-Mandrake-user-who's-thinking-about-Slackware/Dropline-but-would-miss-<br />the-Mandrake-package-management-that-used-to-work-beautifully...<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">SuSE = d3h r0x0rz<br />Redhat = d3h sUx0rz<br /><br />Sorry, couldn't resist. I'm a big fan of SuSE, as far as boxed distros go. IMHO, its the best &quot;all-around&quot; consumer disto of Linux you can get. I used 8.0 for the longest (first &quot;permanent&quot; Linux distro for me) and I would use it today, if I hadn't become so enamored of source-based distros (Gentoo 1.4, if you're curious).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I am a Drake &quot;user.&quot; I tried RH 9 and didn't like it as a user. Maybe as a sysadmin, I would change my mind. But for the guy that just wants to get in and do his office work, surf the web, and play a game or two, Mandrake works great.<br /><br />I didn't like RH for no particular reason. It was just different and I had trouble figuring out where to configure stuff. I know that would be true if I went the other direction also. I like Mandrake and will be staying here for a while. I am sorry to hear the poor report on 9.2. I don't hope that your problem was just you Danc, but I also hope that yours was unique and it really is a good system.<br /><br />Our other Mandrake fan, Steve, has not chimed in to say if he has tried it. What do you think Steve? Give me some good news.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Danc I read your post about firebird and evolution. I had the same problem with galeon and I found the solution somewhere on the net. Here is what I had to do to fix it. I think it will work for you too.<br /><br />Go to gnome control panel and select Advanced &gt; File Types and Programs<br />Go to internet Services and select Add Services<br />In Discription put [E-Mail] without brackets<br />In Protocal put [mailto] must be in lower case<br />In Programs put [/usr/bin/evolution &quot;%s&quot;]<br />click Ok or Close<br /><br />Go to your home directory and edit .gnome/gnome to add the following lines or change as necessary under [URL Handlers]<br />default-show=firebird &quot;%s&quot;<br />mailto-show=evoluton &quot;%s&quot;<br />save and close<br /><br />That fixed it for me.
