					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">two days ago I purchased and installed a new HD.&nbsp; I had the idea that I would run Windows XP&nbsp; (still need it for a few applications) on the older and smaller HD, and would run Debian on the new and much larger HD.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have been doing the dual boot with only one HD for a long time now.&nbsp; I thought it would be safe to install the Debian OS on the last part of the original HD and make the new HD mount as /home.<br /><br />I thought it was working fine as I was able to partition the new HD as /home and I began copying files to it.&nbsp; When I shut down the computer to re-boot into Windows, I received the blue screen of doom.&nbsp; Seems there is a fatal error in Windows and although I cringed about going through the installation process,&nbsp; I decided to do so.&nbsp; That didn&#039;t work either.&nbsp; The Windows XP installation disc kept recycling between loading the initiation files and rebooting;&nbsp; never getting to the actual installation.<br /><br />Soooooo...........&nbsp; am I trying to do something that is not possible?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">No, what you&#039;re doing is perfectly fine. It sounds like you may have other issues. Perhaps your WinXP disc is bad. Does Debian still work fine?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">yep.... Debian Etch is working fine.&nbsp; &nbsp;I hate to mess with anything at this point, because I&#039;ve been working for a day and a half now getting Etch back to where I want it to be.&nbsp; I&#039;ve even been lucky enough to get Amarok to recognize my ipod shuffle now,&nbsp; whereas until yesterday I couldn&#039;t for the life of me get it to do that.&nbsp; I still haven&#039;t been able to get either Limewire for Linux, or Frostwire to work.&nbsp; Limewire indicates that I need to fulfill dependencies of java...... although I&#039;ve downloaded and seemingly successfully installed the newest java for Debian.&nbsp; <br /><br />If it weren&#039;t for Linux completely not recognizing and working with my Epson Stylus Photo R260 printer, which is fairly new, I wouldn&#039;t really worry about using Windows again.&nbsp; <br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">To get that printer to work you will need the correct driver which you can probably get from Debian.&nbsp; There is a cups and lpr version you can download<br />from http://www.avasys.jp/english/linux_e/dl_ink.html just in case debian doesn&#039;t have it.<br />The driver is pipslite-cups-1.0.0-1.i386.rpm for the cups version and pipslite-1.0.0-1.i386.rpm for the lpr version.&nbsp; If you not using cups you might have a <br />problem getting that printer to function.<br />So good luck and may the swartz be with you. <br /><br />Mitchr</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">well.......... here&#039;s where I am.<br /><br />I tried once again to install Windows.&nbsp; I have two discs;&nbsp; one is actually a genuine purchased item - having been used only by myself about 4 times and safely put away in a box until needed again.&nbsp; Neither would install.&nbsp; <br /><br />So I scrubbed the Windows idea and just re-installed Etch.&nbsp; Everything is back to normal.......including not being able to use the printer.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So here is where I say thanks to Mitchr for the information about a driver which might work.&nbsp; &nbsp;Everything I&#039;ve been able to find online about the printer says it&#039;s nothing more than a brick when using Linux OS.&nbsp; I was just about to give up on it and buy an HP Photosmart 2575.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have the HP Photosmart 2575. It is a nice printer. I have it connected to the lan and it was no problem installing it in Slackware 12. The only complaint I have so far is that for some reason after a few months it stopped loading paper by itself and I have to go feed the paper to it manually. I don&#039;t print much, so it is mostly just an annoyance, but figured I would let you know.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">well,&nbsp; I downloaded and attempted to install the driver suggested for cups ( I have cups )&nbsp; &nbsp;but I need to play with it a bit more, as the printer has not responded yet.&nbsp; This is my weakness in Linux;&nbsp; &nbsp;not knowing how to manipulate files.&nbsp; I used to be fairly good with it when DOS was the way to get around a computer, but Windows came along and spoiled me.&nbsp; I&#039;ll try and spend some more time on it later in the week,&nbsp; or I may not have to as there is someone at work interested in buying the R260 from me, and I could just buy a compatible printer.<br /><br />about the PhotoSmart 2575...... I&#039;ve read several reviews about it, and many seem to have the same problem as you, GeekforGod, mention.&nbsp; I&#039;ll probably stay away from that computer now.&nbsp; Thanks for the &quot;heads-up&quot; on that one.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have an Epson that I am using with CUPS too. It took some work to get it going, but I finally figured it out. But, that was over a year ago. I am not sure I could help you along the way.<br /><br />I now have it hooked up to my wife&#039;s Mac and print through the LAN to the printer. Interestingly, it uses CUPS as the official server and driver on the Epson CD for the Mac. I do somewhat remember that there was a whole boatload of drivers for CUPS that were Epson specific. I did not find one that matched my printer exactly, but I use one that seemed to be similar in function and model numbering. It works fine.</div>
