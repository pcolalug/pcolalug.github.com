					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">We had a good meeting tonight with 5 in attendance. We talked a bit about the elections coming up next month and a few other club topics.<br /><br />Mainly we talked about the NX Free software. While a few at the meeting already have Log-Me-In and Go To Meeting accounts, the combination of Hamachi and NX Free accomplish the same task for Linux. (Hamachi is now owned by Log-Me-In). I was very interested in this presentation by Ed since it particularly fulfills a need that I have in my own network.<br /><br />While we struggled a bit to show the full power of the software over the Internet (because of firewall restrictions), Ed did a good job of getting it set up quickly to show on the local network. Thanks Ed.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I also mentioned at the meeting that I would start a thread for nominations. According to the by-laws, we need to wait until the first of October to start that. Be patient and you can start nominating for our next Steering Committee at that time.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Nominations shall be accepted from the first of September until the Friday before the September general meeting. All votes shall be cast in person at the September general meeting.&nbsp; A nominee need not be present at the general meeting to be elected. Newly elected officers will begin their duties on October 1st, following the elections.</div><br />According to that line in the bylaws, we should have started accepting nominations on September 1, with the newly elected officers filling their position starting on October 1.&nbsp; I think that we can start the nomination process now (which is also backed up by this post - http://www.pcolalug.org/smf/index.php?topic=3389.0 (http://www.pcolalug.org/smf/index.php?topic=3389.0), the nominations post for last year, as well as the nominations post for 2006-2007 nominations at http://www.pcolalug.org/smf/index.php?topic=2985.0 (http://www.pcolalug.org/smf/index.php?topic=2985.0)<br /><br />Michael</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m really sorry I couldn&#039;t make it tonight.&nbsp; But something rather important came up on extreme short notice and I was needed elsewhere.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">David are you going to make a separate thread for nominations or can we do it in this thread? </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">David,<br /><br />Have any decisions been made yet on this?&nbsp; The reason I ask is because it seems quite clear that the post should have been made on September 1 (per the bylaws).&nbsp; In nearly all cases, elections have been held in September, with very few exceptions.&nbsp; The last 2 years, it had been postponed either by those at the meeting in September, or due to lack of nominations for a position that has to be filled.&nbsp; The latest that a nominations post has ever been made (even when elections occurred in October), is September 24.<br /><br />Looking through the forums, we can see when things have been posted:<br /><br />2003-2004 - September 10 (see http://www.pcolalug.org/smf/index.php?topic=994.0 (http://www.pcolalug.org/smf/index.php?topic=994.0)), election held in September 2003<br />2004-2005 - August 6 (see http://www.pcolalug.org/smf/index.php?topic=1814.0 (http://www.pcolalug.org/smf/index.php?topic=1814.0)), election held in October 2004<br />2005-2006 - August 25 (see http://www.pcolalug.org/smf/index.php?topic=2570.0 (http://www.pcolalug.org/smf/index.php?topic=2570.0)), election held in September 2005<br />2006-2007 - August 21 (see http://www.pcolalug.org/smf/index.php?topic=2985.0 (http://www.pcolalug.org/smf/index.php?topic=2985.0)), election held in September 2006<br />2007-2008 - September 24 (see http://www.pcolalug.org/smf/index.php?topic=3227.0 (http://www.pcolalug.org/smf/index.php?topic=3227.0)), election held in October 2007 by request of those present 9/2006<br />2008-2009 - September 3 (see http://www.pcolalug.org/smf/index.php?topic=3389.0 (http://www.pcolalug.org/smf/index.php?topic=3389.0)), election held in October 2008 (no nominations for President, so postponed).<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Michael</div>
