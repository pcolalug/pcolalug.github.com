					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello Everyone,<br /><br />I am in the process of starting a community forum for Pensacola. It's located at http://www.pensacola.cc/forums. &nbsp;Eventually the homepage will be this http://www.pensacola.cc/index_new.php<br /><br />I really need help to seed the forums and get the membership count up. If you have a few minutes please register with the forums and maybe do a post. &nbsp;I would also like to get a little bit of cross posting in the Technology forums if you can. Be sure to include a link back PcolaLUG in your signature.<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">Member of&#58; &#91;url=http&#58;//www.pcolalug.org/&#93;Linux UG&#91;/url&#93;<br /></div><br /><br />Also I'm doing a custom CMS using PHP/MySQL to run the final site. That ought to be a fun project incase anyone wants to discuss it.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Jamie</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Why hack your own CMS? There are lots of good ones out there like Zope/Plone, or even, $DIETY forbid, slashcode.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi rburt3,<br /><br />I have a pretty thourough understanding of what is out there although I have not used much in the production environment. I probably spent a full 4 days looking at and installing all the various CMS's on Hotscripts.com. &nbsp;;)<br /><br />Most of the CMS's are fantastic and offer many features, but what I run into is that many of them are either over-featured or not easily customizable for my needs. Generally a database driven CMS is super easy to build. &nbsp;Also, I guess I should have also said that I will be reselling this CMS through my business. ;)<br /><br />Jamie</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: Jaime</div><div class="quote">I will be reselling this CMS through my business.</div><br />Seems a lot of extra work, considering the wealth of freely available options we've mentioned. The Zope-based (ZPL license, OSS certified) ones don't preclude you making mods and re-selling them, either (yeah, OSS!). In fact, nothing that is GPL precludes you from re-selling it (modded or not), so long as you release the source.<br /><br />No critisizm intended. Sounds like a fun project.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Can you recommend any good articles on using Zope? It looks interesting, but it's a seperate webserver/appserver, uses Python, and seems to be at too low of a level to work with unless you have a dedicated server. <br /><br />I really need a PHP solution so that I can intall on shared servers and easily modify the database and templates. (I do not know Perl)<br /><br />Using existing class libraries for specific functionality, i.e. file uploads, with custom programming is really the best solution for me. Probably a 40 hour investment + 2 hours per customer for lite modification.<br /><br />J</div>
