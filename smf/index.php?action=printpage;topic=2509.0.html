					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just ordered some Mandrake 10.1 CD's from http://www.easlylinuxcds.com. &nbsp;Is that the most recent release or is <b>Mandriva</b> something else besides a change of name?<br /><br />I saw a Mandriva DVD for sale also but didn't know if it was different.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The newest version is Mandriva LE 2005, which is what would have been Mandrake 10.2. &nbsp;They changed the name at the same time as they were due to release 10.2 and decided to change the version numbering also. &nbsp;From now on they will be releasing only once a year. &nbsp;Mandriva 2006 is due out in the fall.<br /><br />So, to fully answer your question, what you bought is a version behind... &nbsp;To tell the truth, there isn't that much difference anyway. &nbsp;If I were you I'd get that installed, and wait for the 2006 version for your next upgrade.<br /><br />Dan</div>
