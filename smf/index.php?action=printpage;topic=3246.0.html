					Title: <b>How to access the Library.</b><br />
					Post by: <b>bhoff</b> on <b>November 09, 2007, 05:11:46 pm</b>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Library books are for the use and education of the entire group. If books are neglected or are not returned in a reasonable time frame, the offending member may be barred from the library. A member who fails to return a book for an extended period of time, severely damages materials, or otherwise abuses books belonging to the Pensacola Linux User&#039;s Group or members thereof may be required to replace damaged or lost material. In severe cases, the offending user may be banned from membership and participation in the Pensacola Linux User&#039;s Group.<br /><br />As a sponsor, O&#039;Reilly allows members to request free books, provided that the requester write a review of the book and publish same in the Pensacola Linux User&#039;s Group forums, as well as two-or-three other relevant sites (Slashdot, Amazon, etc). Should a member fail to complete a review in a timely manner, the book in question may revert to another member, or the general library. This is so that the Pensacola Linux User&#039;s Group can maintain it&#039;s advantageous relationship with O&#039;Reilly and continue to receive materials beneficial to all members.<br /><br />The way it works in you checkout the&nbsp; O&#039;reilly website and find a book that you are interested in and pm me your request I will contact O&#039;reilly and get said book and deliver to next meeting. You then get time to digest book and write short review to be posted as stated above. After you have finished the book it comes back to the Library for 4 months to give other members a chance to check it out and gain from it after said time book goes back to original requester and then he can keep private or list it to me to be added to the list of available books.<br /><br />Hope this helps and list of books will be forthcoming.</div>
