					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Has anyone done anything cool with Linux lately?<br /><br />I was able (with very detailed instructions) to move the major storage from RAM on my Zaurus to the Secure Digital card. This was done using symlinks. By linking certain directories I am able to install any of my apps into RAM and it will then be transferred to the SD card. This frees up RAM to be used as RAM and not storage.<br /><br />Also, if my system crashes and I have to reinstall everything (due to a serious flaw in the construction of the Z this does happen) then I just have to rebuild three symlinks and everything is restored without actually reinstalling.<br /><br />That is what I have done with my Linux lately. What neat things had you done? I admit this is not really complicated, but just being able to do this is cool.<br /><br />(hint: I am just trying to get some discussion going since everyone seems to be busy with the Spring actvities)</div>
