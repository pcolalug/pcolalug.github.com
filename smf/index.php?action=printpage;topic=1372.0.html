					Title: <b>Video card back from the dead</b><br />

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just brought a video card back from the dead. &nbsp;Well it wasn't quite dead, but it had one foot in the grave, and the other on a banana peel. &nbsp;Here's the story and how I got it working properly again.<br /><br />I just replaced my video card with an older card this morning. &nbsp;After I put it in, I noticed a few odd characters during POST messages. &nbsp;When Linux took over I was getting psychedelic colors and very weird characters. &nbsp; I took a look at my XF86Config, and everything was set up properly there. &nbsp;<br />I then rebooted and started looking at my bios settings. &nbsp;All the characters in the bios were out of whack. &nbsp;So thinking the video card was going south, I decided to pull it and put my previous card back in. &nbsp;<br /><br />When I pulled the card I noticed that the gold pins on the AGP connector were a little tarnished. &nbsp;I remembered from my days in the Marine Corps when we had to clean up our field radios, we would use rubber erasers to clean the contact points. &nbsp;So I whipped out a good old No. 2 and started erasing away on all the contact points on the video card. &nbsp;It worked like a charm! &nbsp;Video card now works perfect with no funky colors or characters. &nbsp;<br /><br />I just thought that I would share this. &nbsp;I'll definitely try this again before I toss out any malfunctioning PCI or AGP card in the future.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Kyle</div>
