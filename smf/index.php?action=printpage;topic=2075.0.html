					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Funny I just researched this the other day.<br /><br />http://mlf.linux.rulez.org/mlf/ezaz/ntfsresize.html<br /><br />Written with the new ntfs driver, it's much more stable than the last.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Try the Trinity Rescue Kit (http://trinityhome.org/trk/). It is livecd geared toward system recovery. It has the ntfsprogs to include ntfsresize. I have used it several times for similar things. It's great to have around if you maintain any Windows systems for offline administrator password recoveries and fat file rescue. Ah, leave it to linux to say a Windows administrator.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Bhoff,<br />I have a toshiba laptop that I run Suse on with XP media center. &nbsp;I resized my partition when I installed Suse with no problems what so ever. &nbsp; &nbsp;Prior to the install I did a defrag in windows to tighten things up. &nbsp;One of the reason I chose Suse was that they support Toshiba laptops so well. &nbsp;Most of my hardware works out of the box and built in support for my FX keys and so on. &nbsp;Good luck on your install. &nbsp;<br /><br />Lee</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I down loaded System-Rescue cd and used &quot;run_qtparted&quot; a very nice gui based partition resizer that will saftley resize any format. Also has a lot of other nice features. Was able to resize my partitions in about 2 minutes have checked and rechecked the NTFS and al is good in the world.<br />Thanks Guys for your input.</div>
