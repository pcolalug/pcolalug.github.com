					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">IRC Hacks<br />100 Industrial-Strength Tips &amp; Tools<br />By Paul Mutton<br />First Edition July 2004 <br />Series: Hacks<br />ISBN: 0-596-00687-X<br />432 pages, $24.95<br /><br />I found this book to be fairly interesting and somewhat useful. &nbsp;Being quite familiar with IRC already, some of the introductory material was information that I already knew, but I did learn a few things about the more technical aspects of the IRC protocol and IRC servers/networks. &nbsp;Much of this book has to do with writing and using IRC channel &quot;bots&quot;, which I think most casual IRC users would not be all that interested in. &nbsp;<br /><br />The first four chapters introduce what IRC is, and how to connect to an IRC network and begin chatting with others. &nbsp;Various IRC client applications are described, including the most popular ones for Linux, Mac, and Windows. &nbsp;Other topics here include how to register your nickname, configuring your client, how to join servers/channels, and some nice customizations to add functionality and enjoyment to your use of IRC. &nbsp;I would think that these first chapters would be very useful to a newcomer to IRC, and allow them to get up and running quickly.<br /><br />Chapter 5 introduces the concepts of &quot;bots&quot;, and how to write your own bots in various languages, including Perl, Python, and Java. &nbsp;Some of it is fairly technical, and may appeal mostly to programmers and more serious IRC &quot;hackers&quot;. &nbsp;Also mentioned is the idea of bot &quot;ethics&quot; and the policies that many IRC networks have regarding their use.<br /><br />The next several chapters (6 - 12) provide numerous ideas and examples of making and using your own bots. &nbsp;IRC bots can perform many functions, some of which can be very useful, and others that have primarily an entertainment value. &nbsp;Much of the content of these chapters is actual code examples for many different types of bots, including Logging, Social, Search &amp; Query, Announcement, Network and Channel Management, and Fun bots.<br /><br />Chapters 13 - 15 go a little further into the technical side of how the IRC protocol works, encryption, web access to IRC, and even how to run your own IRC server. &nbsp;Many readers will find these subjects more complex than they care to get involved in.<br /><br />Overall, I think this book is best suited to IRC users who are somewhat more than beginners, and are fairly technically oriented. &nbsp;I was surprised by the large amount of bot programming examples, which actually make up the majority of the book. &nbsp;I am not sure there will be that many users who really want to code their own bot. &nbsp;The first few chapters are helpful for IRC beginners, although there are probably better books for that purpose. &nbsp;I did get some ideas for modifying an existing bot, which I presently use occasionally in our LUG's IRC channel for entertainment (trivia contests). &nbsp;All in all, this title is best suited for more experienced users who may enjoy programming and &quot;hacking&quot; around with IRC bots.<br /><br /><br />* This review also posted on the O'Reilly, Amazon, and Barnes&amp;Noble websites.<br /><br />--</div>
