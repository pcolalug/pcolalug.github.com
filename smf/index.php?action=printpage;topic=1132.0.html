					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Note to P'cola LUG users: &nbsp;I got this book FREE from Slashdot, for previously submitting a review on another book to their site... &nbsp; :D <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Wow! &nbsp;Mastering Red Hat Linux 9 is a huge and very complete guide to Red Hat Linux 9. &nbsp;It's over 900 pages, and includes the &quot;Publisher's Edition&quot; of RH9 on 2 CD's. &nbsp;It is written in a style which should accomodate Linux newcomers and more experienced users alike. &nbsp;There are a LOT of examples, code snippets, and screenshots throughout the book. &nbsp;In fact sometimes the abundance of these tend to make the material a little long to wade through. &nbsp;Experts should have no trouble skipping over the sections they don't need though.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The book starts out with in an introduction to Linux, and has a good chapter on preparing to install, including hardware checklists. &nbsp;This is followed by a very detailed step by step explanation of installing Red Hat, both locally and via network. &nbsp;A nice part of this is a troubleshooting chapter for solving installation problems. &nbsp;Part Two explains the basics of using the command line, how filesystems work in Linux, and using the shell for various tasks.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Part Three includes chapters for administering users and groups on your new system, and how the RPM software package management process works. &nbsp;Other chapters in this part explain the bootup process and how to configure it, various ways to perform system backups, and other common adminstration tasks such as cron jobs and logs. &nbsp;Especially useful should be Chapter 12 which explains how to update/compile your own kernel. &nbsp;There are very good examples of the myriad kernel options, mostly by using the xconfig utility.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The next several chapters go over how to configure and use the XWindows display system, including good examples from the XF86Config file. &nbsp;This is followed by detailed explanations of configuring and using the Gnome and KDE desktop environments. &nbsp;The KDE discussion is very good, considering Red Hat is more known for it's use of Gnome as the default desktop. &nbsp;Chapter 18 introduces many of the more commonly used graphical applications in Linux, such as OpenOffice, Gnome Office, and the KOffice suite. &nbsp;Chapter 19 should be very handy for Linux/RH new users, as it outlines the Red Hat graphical configuration utilities which allow customization of the desktop look-and-feel and other system preferences.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Chapters 20-22 cover basic Linux networking. &nbsp;The first part of this section gives a very understandable primer on TCP/IP and network terminology. &nbsp;This is followed up by excellent discussions on how to setup and manage networking on your Linux computer, including security recommendations and firewall/masquerading methods. &nbsp;Once you've got your network running safely, there are additional chapters which cover topics such as remote access and xinetd services, and various server applications installation and operation. &nbsp;These include DNS, DHCP, CUPS printing operations, FTP servers (and clients), NFS and NIS, and mail servers (sendmail). &nbsp;Some of these services are probably more than most home users would need, and the sendmail operation in particular is a little difficult to understand.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Chapter 29 (using Samba) will probably be a great help for people desiring to integrate a Linux system with existing Windows computers on a network. &nbsp;It offers an excellent tutorial on how to share files and resources across the LAN, and includes an explanation of the SWAT configuration utility which greatly simplifies initial setup for newcomers. &nbsp;The final chapter in the book explains how to install and setup a basic webserver using the Apache sofware. &nbsp;The Appendix of the book is a relatively short section called the Linux Command Reference. &nbsp;There is some handy information in this, although it seems to be organized somewhat haphazardly. &nbsp;The book's Index seems to be very complete.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Overall I found this book to be a very useful reference tool. &nbsp;It is basic enough for most beginners to get all the help they need, and has a good amount of usable knowledge for more advanced Linux users. &nbsp;One thing I have realized is that much of the information here is not necessarily RedHat-specific, so can be helpful to users of other Linux distributions as well. &nbsp;I would highly recommend this as a valuable addition to your bookshelf.</div>
