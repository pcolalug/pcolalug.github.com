					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That looks wonderfully handy.<br /><br />Does this mean I get no more help in the IRC channel?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here&#039;s another link with some really good info (and it contains yet another good link):<br /><br />http://www.unixguide.net/linux/linuxshortcuts.shtml<br /><br />Dan<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">First thing I noticed in that second &quot;cheat sheet&quot; is the switching between vty&#039;s. Unless you are in X, you don&#039;t have to use ctrl with alt + Fnum. If you are in X and you want to break out into the console, then you use ctrl+alt+Fnum.<br /><br />Also, arrowing through the command history is only applicable with certain shells such as BASH and ZSH. CSH, KSH and good ol&#039; Bourne Shell don&#039;t support command history or tab file name completion.<br /><br />Shift+PgUp/PgDn doesn&#039;t always work depending on your terminal. This is especially true with a framebuffer console and when using GNU Screen. This also doesn&#039;t work on a lot of dumb terminals and traditional UNIX machines (Sun hardware for example).<br /><br />Ctrl+Alt+Del may have no effect on your system. It is all in how the system is setup to interpret the combination. My debian system doesn&#039;t do a dang thing when you give it a Ctrl+Alt+Del...and that&#039;s how I like it. I like having to type sudo /sbin/shutdown -h now...and yes include the whole path because I don&#039;t use the sbin dirs in my PATH.<br /><br />And who the heck uses pico and rsh these days?! No mention of VI or VIM?!<br /><br />I guess you can&#039;t cover all of the caveats.<br /><br />One more glaring error, not every configuration file uses # for comments. Also, a comment means that it is ignored by the program so you can type whatever you want there without causing any problems.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">True, there are a few things in there that could be stated more clearly.&nbsp; I think the intended audience of the article was the less experienced (newbie) Linux user.&nbsp; Assuming that, there aren&#039;t many users who *don&#039;t* have X running, and there aren&#039;t many using a shell other than BASH.<br /><br />To argue just a bit...&nbsp; &nbsp;:o&nbsp; &nbsp;The article didn&#039;t say that *every* config file uses the &quot;#&quot; character for comments.&nbsp; It said that &quot;in a config file...&nbsp; the # is a comment&quot;&nbsp; ...which is entirely true.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br /><br />FWIW, I use pico frequently (as well as vi/vim/elvis).&nbsp; &nbsp;8)<br /><br />Dan<br /><br /></div>
