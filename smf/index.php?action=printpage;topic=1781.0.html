					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Linspire has integrated their SIPphone (IP Based phone) service into gaim and named it PhoneGaim. &nbsp;As usual, linspire uses get a binary package and other users can grab the source. &nbsp;Their SIP phone service is free, you get a phone number, can call other IP based phone users for free, and can call regular phones. &nbsp;I think the site says you get 5 minutes of calls to 10 different countries free per day.<br /><br />http://www.homeweb.org/~imnes/linux/linspire/screens/phonegaim1.png<br /><br />The website for their SIP phone service is http://www.sipphone.com/<br />They have physical phone hardware, and software-based phones for Windows, Mac, and Linux.<br /><br />And the website for PhoneGaim is <br />http://www.phonegaim.com/<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">imnes,<br />I have been using skype on a windows box for voip for some time now, well several weeks ago they came out with a linux version. &nbsp;It is far superior to any voip that I have ever used. &nbsp;Strictly computer to computer. The linux version is not quite as good as the windows version but its good. &nbsp; Check it out at:<br /><br /><br />http://www.skype.com/<br /><br />Lee</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I do like the ability of phonegaim / sip to be able to call regular phone #'s and have regular phones call me. &nbsp;That's a nice feature. &nbsp;<br /><br />I'll give Skype a try and see how it does. &nbsp;I have Java Desktop 2 on my laptop so I can run it there but I have Linspire (Debian Sid) on my desktop, not sure if any of the binaries will work on it. &nbsp;Do you know if a source package / debian build is available?<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'll have a slackware package of phonegaim up later if anyone wants to try it. &nbsp;I'm building it on Slackware 10 with Dropline Gnome but hopefully it will work on stock Slackware 10 as well. &nbsp;I'll have someone try it on a Slackware 9 setup also and see if it functions there.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Got an initial build of it done. &nbsp;What a mess, had to completely hack the dependencies and makefiles to get it to build. &nbsp;Only problem seems to be one missing icon for the Call button - I'm not sure why I'll try to perfect it later. &nbsp;<br /><br />If anyone using slackware 10 wants to try it out, first remove your existing gaim, then get the packages from <br />http://www.cs.uwf.edu/~nsmith/phonegaim-0.79-slackware-10/<br />(there's 4 of them) and installpkg them.<br /><br />Let me know if it works, if you notice any problems, if it crashes, if it won't even run, etc.<br /><br />Also any brave users with older revisions of slackware could try it as well, I only have 10.0 to try on right now.<br /><br />Screenshot: http://www.cs.uwf.edu/~nsmith/phonegaim-0.79-slackware-10/0_79_on_10.png<br /><br />I think I have to open up a port in my firewall before this will work, but it you want to try calling me from your SIP Phone / PhoneGaim client, my # is 1-747-669-7873<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">hi. &nbsp;for the past day or so, I have been trying to attempt the same feat and compile phonegaim 0.79 on slack 10. &nbsp;<br /><br />thanks to your posted binaries, this is no longer imperative, but I still want build it for sport.<br /><br />something puzzles me though.. I get the following error during compilation:<br /><br />phonegaim-0.79/src/sipphone.c:235: undefined reference to `linphone_core_check_stun_settings'<br /><br />unlike all the other missing symbols errors, I cannot for the life of me find a mention of &quot;linphone_core_check_stun_settings&quot; in any headers on my system (i installed linphone-0.12.2 as a prerequisite), or for that matter, on google. &nbsp;The only other place I have ever seen this symbol, is in a diff file called &quot;t&quot;, in the src directory. &nbsp;And all that does is removes the line from the source file.<br /><br />That sorf of implies that i can just comment out the line, and everything will compile, which it does. &nbsp;But still WTF? &nbsp;The diff doesn't even cleanly apply to sipphone.c! &nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway.. yadayadayada, my phonegaim build doesn't load any plugins, thanks a lot for the slack binaries, and if you have anything to say about this, i would be very interested to hear it.<br /><br />also - since you've probably dealt with it, the reason my phonegaim build does not work, is because none of the plugins load. &nbsp;and i am not quite sure why..</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sorry man, it's been 4 months since I did that, and it was a nightmare to get it to build. &nbsp;I don't really remember all the hacking that went on to get it.<br /><br />Nick</div>
