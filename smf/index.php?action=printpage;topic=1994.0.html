					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm playing around with some more Java IDEs. &nbsp;This time it's IntelliJ IDEA by JetBrains (http://www.jetbrains.com/).<br /><br />Seems good so far. &nbsp;The GUI editor is very easy to use as a wysiwyg layout tool, but you still have to hand-code a lot of stuff behind the scenes - like action listeners. &nbsp;JDeveloper and NetBeans do a nice job of writing that boilerplate code for you.<br /><br />The CVS integration in IntelliJ is the best I've seen, it just works. &nbsp;I've tried to use CVS features in JDeveloper and NetBeans and they either just flat out don't work, or have bugs / annoyances with them. &nbsp;IntelliJ is full-featured, even allowing rollback of code changes from the IDE.<br /><br />This tool also has J2EE web integration, supports I think WebSphere and Tomcat. &nbsp;I will try to get a server installed and try out those features later this week.<br /><br />The only problem with this tool so far: $500 per user license. &nbsp;:(<br /><br />I think so far the best open-source IDE for my users is going to be NetBeans, but I'd like to give Eclipse a good run before deciding. &nbsp;Once I figure out all the plugins I need, and hopefully can find a plugin for wysiwyg GUI design.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Eclipse has a graphical editor framework or something like that. It is a wysiwyg swing editor and I believe you can use IBM's widget set too(the name escapes me at the moment). It is a plugin, but they distribute it from the main eclipse site. It seemed pretty nice when I used it a few months ago, it was still a beta tool though and it ran so slowly on my machine that I didn't keep it. Of course, this poor thing is only a 450 mhz P3 with 256 MB of ram so it should run fine on a real machine. <br /><br />I am still waiting for a GUI editor for java like trolltech provides with QT. Easy to make GUIs with less hassle to make it cross platform. Then again, if people just had Python installed instead of or alongside Java, then I would use PyQt.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">IBM's GUI framework is called SWT (its what Eclipse itself uses). The GUI designer for Eclipse is built on top of the Eclipse GEF (Graphical Editing Framework). Its this framework that allows for many different kinds of graphical editing tools/plugins like the MDA plugins.</div>
