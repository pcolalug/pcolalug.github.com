					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">[ Edited by Rugmonster to more appropriate grounds ]<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: Rugmonster</div><div class="quote">Oh yeah, I run Windows because I like to play games. I don't understand why we expect game developers to give us binaries for Linux considering there just aren't that many gamers who run Linux only, making the extra effort sort of rediculous. If Linux users want to play games, then let's put more effort into making WineX better or make it more commercially viable for the manufacturers to develop Linux versions.</div><br /><br />I dunno, ruggy... I wonder if there are better ways to make Linux and other OSS platforms more attractive to game developers. While you're right, better Wine would go a long way, I believe that just fosters the &quot;well, it works in Wine, no need for native binaries&quot; attitude. I'd rather have native code anyday.<br /><br />What I think would be great is a development library, similar to SDL or clanlib, that facilitates quicker game development that is cross-platform out of the box. Think Renderware, but with more platforms.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I agree. Perhaps the Linux community could come up with a DirectX work alike to allow for easier porting. If we want games so badly, we can't just complaint they aren't made. I have to wonder if anyone out there has put the effort forth to ask the big names like Gabe Newell (would say John Carmack, but he already caters to us) what they would like to see in ways of a framework. Microsoft isn't going to work with us on this, so we have to do our best to work around them. <br /><br />The pay off just isn't there for them and from what I understand, the money just isn't as great as it used to be. With all of the pressure of missed deadlines and threats of having a title named vaporware, I can only imagine what the developers must think of the idea of developing and testing a project for not just one, or two if they support Mac, but three different platforms. Think about all of the variables you have in Linux with the different sound architectures and graphical environments!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Could this be more of a money problem than devlopment platfor problem. What I mean is that maybe there is no porting/developping of major games in Linux because Linux users, for the most part, are not willing to spend money on software. A good example: Look at Loki. I'm not saying that you or I won't go out and spend money on a decent program but a majority of Linux users may not be willing to lay out the cash for software. <br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I believe software, in general, will be paid for if there is a reason to do so. I wonder how many linux users are really interested in games. I tend to think most linux installations are on servers, workstations and hobby systems. Yes, there are the hardcore who use it as their primary desktop, but for the most part, linux is a secondary operating system to Windows. I don't know how much of a market there is for linux games. <br /><br />I'm kind of curious what DirectX actually does now. It seems to be the center to most of the audio and graphics in most modern games and a core complaint to porting games to linux. The games that do get ported seem to use OpenGL and the audio layer is rewritten for linux. It's times like these that I wished I knew more about the inner workings of games.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Things like OpenGL (graphics), and OpenAL (sound) are cross platform already. &nbsp;And there's always SDL for networking, keyboard/mouse/joystick io, so the software is there. &nbsp;If companies would develop on these technologies from the start they would pretty much automatically have cross-platform titles with little more effort.<br /><br />I don't think you could get by with just writing a directx library for Linux to compile against, I think most windows games are probably making use of other APIs available in windows that wouldn't be portable. &nbsp;I guess though you could use winelib (maybe from winex with directx libraries) to recompile your title for Linux and have a native executable? &nbsp;I'm not sure how that works...<br /><br />Nick</div>

In the big scheme of things Linux has very little market share compared to Windows. <br />2. There's doubt whether Linux users would be willing to pay for games. (Again, Look at the Loki experience. They had some of the best selling games on the market at the time, ported to Linux and they still went bankrupt.)<br />3. It would mean extra work and money to port/recompile and test their games on Linux.<br />4. They're already making a ton of Money on the Windows platform.<br /><br />The bottom line is that the incentive for the Big game companies just isn't there. <br />The only viable solution for Linux as a gaming system is to have current Open Source developpers get into developping games. Why don't the devloppers that work on Open Office or Gimp or Mozilla try writing an open source game? This is the question we should be asking. The bottom line is that we're not going to get the big game companies over to Linux, we have to use the resources we have. <br /><br />My suggestion, start working on a Game yourself. Develop a strategy and story line for it and then invite developpers from the above mentioned apps. They are the ones that can do it.<br /><br />Or, go back to the tried and true playing Games on a Windows platform or emulator.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It's simple. &nbsp;Nobody's forcing them to develop for Linux but they are forced to develop for Windows.<br /><br />I guess I'd be &quot;hardcore&quot; too since I love using Linux as a primary desktop. &nbsp;It REALLY and I mean REALLY ticks me off to have to run a Windows partition to play my games in addition since I can't seem to get various games running in Linux very well at all. &nbsp;The benchmarks, and my own experience, still show that Doom 3 runs better in Windows (the full story is that they used some VC.NET optimizations and couldn't for the Linux port because of gcc) and I still can't get surround sound in Linux even outside of gaming. &nbsp;Oh, on Doom 3 mysteriously (for the second time in a row) I can only run the game as root after several runs as a user and my framerate's even worse than it was before...all mysteriously. &nbsp;I just tried to install UT2003 on Linux and it flat-out DIDN'T work. &nbsp;Like, didn't install at ALL for no apparent reason. &nbsp;I shouldn't have these difficulties just to install a program.<br /><br /><br />Getting Wine to work, for a novice like me, is difficult. &nbsp;Period. &nbsp;I'm still not certain of how exactly to get Wine to run Dawn of War or else I'd be running it in Linux.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />But anyway, nobody's making any developers develop for Linux. &nbsp;It's really great that ID and Epic are on our side here but nobody is MAKING them do anything. &nbsp;Unless you make them by, say, &quot;alternative&quot; means, they won't because humans as a rule go by the path of least resistance.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Hell, look at Half-Life 2. &nbsp;NO Linux support, unless you want to run their servers. &nbsp;Linux people run their servers and never got Valve to make a client. &nbsp;The best HL and CS servers are ALWAYS in Linux but Steam and HL never got a Linux client. &nbsp;Great job, guys and gals, just keep supporting them while they DON'T give you a client. &nbsp;Here's a thought, how about nobody run any stable Linux servers until they get a client? &nbsp;Apparently this idea is lost.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Good points, everyone (except for the uncomfortable trash talking...). Anyway, I think that, in this case anyway, having Windows and Mac and other platforms in this discussion is very relevent. The whole &quot;debate&quot; is &quot;How do we get the kind of commercial game support that Windows (and even OSX, for crissakes) has&quot;?<br /><br />My (other) 2 cents:<br />1. Loki's demise was as much due to pathetic and even criminal management as it was to market share. Had they been able to hold the course and be a bit more conservative, I think they'd be doing quite well today. This is, of course, pure speculation.<br /><br />2. There are TONS of OpenSource games. There are several decent and even commercial grade game engines available for free or low cost that run cross-platform (one of my personal favorites is Torque (http://www.garagegames.com)).<br /><br />3. Even with (2), most ambitious OSS game projects never come to fruition, because, well, building games is hard.<br /><br />4. Like steve always says (in his own, lovable way), vote with your dollars. If a game comes out with Linux support, buy it. If a game comes out <i>promising</i> Linux support, don't buy it until you have the native binary available (this is why I didn't buy Doom3 when it came out).<br /><br />5. Send a thoughtful, polite email to the publisher of your next anticipated title and ask for alternate OS support.<br /><br />6. Buy a PlayStation and/or an XBox. I used to snicker at console gamers too. I dare you to play Star Wars Battlefront (think BattleField 1942 but in a galaxy far, far away) and not love it. You may say, &quot;but rburt3, how will this help the commercial Linux game market?&quot; Well, the game industry is in a much tighter market these days, and PC gaming is taking the lions-share of the hit (consoles always out-perform PC games in terms of sales). So, with more &quot;traditional&quot; gamer's dollars going to consoles, the PC crowd may just look for alternative platforms to market to. Sure, we're a small minority of desktop users, but that percentage looks more significant when your overall market share is dwindling. We are also, I think, a great market in which a few small, independent developers could make a decent living from (this is how PC gaming got started, doncha know). We are the hobbiests and enthusiests that are likely to buy into that. Besides, rumor is that the next PlayStation will be a Linux gaming machine anyway...<br /><br />7. Support hobby OSS games. I know, not everyone is a programmer, but there is a mountain of documentation and support stuff to do for every OSS project out there (even games). Folks who write good documentation are as reviered and respected as the uber hackers in this community (just not as publicly).<br /><br />8. I think warez are probably less rampant with dedicated Linux users than other platforms. Sure, we expect our infrastructure-type stuff to be free (OS, compiler, libs and drivers), but most of the folks I know gladly shell out the money for good, well-supported software. If you don't, you're slime plain and simple. Not because &quot;programmers gotta eat', but because there are alternatives in most cases that are legally and morrally free, and pirating software is stealing no matter how you justify it. I can't afford a new car, and I need a car to get to and from work. I don't steal the latest greatest car, I use the one I have and learn how to fix it or pay to have it fixed.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just listed my issues with the Doom3 client over in one of the two Doom 3 threads I made over in &quot;Games&quot; so as not to hijack this thread. :)<br /><br />For UT2003 I checked out your thread and I'm going to be trying it out as soon as I have a chance.</div>
