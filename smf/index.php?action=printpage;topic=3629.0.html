Garrison&#039;&quot; XXXXXXXX<br />Subject: Computer Tech 2010 Saturday, January 23, 2010<br />Date: Tue, 19 Jan 2010 10:40:53 -0600<br /><br />Hi Members,<br /><br />Most of you know about our Computer Tech 2010 at the Northwest Florida State College, Niceville, Florida on Saturday, January 23, 2010. &nbsp;This is our 4th year for this type of computer event for the home computer user. &nbsp;Many of our SWCTC members attended Expo ’09 and everyone plans to attend on Saturday. &nbsp;This event is open to the public and is free.<br /><br />When you arrive at the Northwest Florida State College follow the directional road signs entering the campus using the West Gate. &nbsp;Follow the signs to the Building K parking area. &nbsp;Look for the banner over the entrance to Building K. Come through the entrance doors to the College Mall and go to our registration desk on the right side.<br /><br />Classes start at 8:30 AM so plan to arrive early and register or check in to get a goody bag (one per family) and one door prize ticket per person. &nbsp;Arriving early will give you enough time to become familiar with classroom locations. &nbsp;Some classes are sure to fill up before others so if you want to be sure of getting a sit go to the workshop of your choice without delay. &nbsp;The fire code dictates the seating capacity for each room that we must follow.<br /><br />The Boys and Girls Club of America and the Secondsplease Cheese Cake Company will offer lunch and cheese cake from 11:30 AM to 1.00 PM at the College Mall (Bldg K). &nbsp;We have more than 14 Vendors we invite you to visit throughout the day. &nbsp;This is another great place to get answers to your computer questions and learn new technology. &nbsp;Look for some of the Tech ’10 specials that are being offered by some vendors. &nbsp;Some vendors are offering specials on laptop repairs if you bring your laptop to this event and leave it with them.<br /><br />We have some of the most knowledgeable presenters at Computer Tech 2010. &nbsp;On your Schedule of Events you have 24 different workshops to choose from. You are encouraged to take notes. &nbsp;Most all of the presentations will be posted on the http://www.NWFACUG.org web site for your use.<br /><br />Carl Lofstrom<br /><br />PS: I expect to see all of our SWCTC computer members on Saturday at Computer Tech 2010. <br /><br />=====<br /><br />Local Press Release:<br /><br />Free Computer Expo for Home Computer Users January 23 at NWF State College<br /><br />The fourth annual “Computer Tech 2010” will be held Saturday, January 23 from 8:30 am to 4:00 pm at the Northwest Florida State College Niceville campus in the College Mall, Building K. &nbsp;The free event focuses on the home computer user and will feature 24 free “How-To” workshops, vendor displays and door prizes. &nbsp;The annual event is the only one of this type in the Florida Panhandle.<br /><br />Workshop topics include: buying and selling on e-Bay, creative use of photos, internet browser choices, Twitter and Facebook tips, 3D movies for your PC &amp; TV, basic web design, how to stop identity theft, Microsoft Windows 7, and more. &nbsp;Also, locally popular &quot;The Geek&quot; Jeff Werner will participate. &nbsp;Werner is the computer columnist with the Northwest Florida Daily News.<br /><br />The event is designed for the home computer user at all skill levels from beginner to advanced. &nbsp;For a complete schedule see attachment or visit www.nwfacug.org . &nbsp;The expo is sponsored by the Association of Personal Computer Users Groups, Northwest Florida Association of Computer User Groups, and NWF State College’s PrimeTime Continuing Education program.<br /><br />=====<br /></div></div>
