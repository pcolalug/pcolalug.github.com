					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;d also like to say happy Thanksgiving to everyone. I hope everyone has something to be thankful for. I have my health, my friends and family, I am about to graduate from college, and, of course, my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. I have much to be thankful for and it is a wonderful Thanksgiving day. I hope God has blessed you all as well.&nbsp; ;D</div>

Just seems a waste to cook a turkey for 3 people. Last year we had a party with 40 people. This year it was just us. The whole chicken, pre-cooked (and very delicious) cost less than $7. I bet you paid a bit more for your bird. And still had to do all the work. I realize that the preparing of the meal is half the fun. So, we did miss out on that. But, it was an excuse to eat our favorite chicken. ;D<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: danc</div><div class="quote">Didja have any stuffing or cranberries?</div><br />Hard to stuff a chicken that is pre-cooked. No dressing either.<br /><br />Don&#039;t like cranberries and at $2.50 a can, it seems a waste for something that you don&#039;t like.<br /><br />What fun to break traditions.</div>
