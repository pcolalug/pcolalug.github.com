					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi all.<br /><br />Just wanted to let you know that Americas Army 2.5 is out.&nbsp; <br /><br />Over all I think it&#039;s a fairly good release.&nbsp; Those of you who haven&#039;t played it in a while...(basically everyone that runs linux&nbsp; ;D) should give it a try.<br />I think it&#039;s one of the best fps ever made, not to mention the best (and only, w the exception of TCE) tactical shooter for linux.<br /><br />See you on the field of battle.<br /><br />Brent</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">kinda getting burnt out on ET so haven&#039;t been playing as much anymore. might consider playing AA again for a little while. I just hope the CS-type kiddies have been ran off by now, they were getting bad when I dropped AA.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">lol, whoops forgot that... sry <br /><br />Anyway, this I think this release was specifically designed to crush the spirit of script kiddies...<br /><br />They seriously tweaked things to balance things out and eliminate lamer strategies.<br /><br />For instance, bunny hoping is now dead.&nbsp; The ar, and sniper rifle are much more accurate, while the m4 has been toned down some.&nbsp; I think this balances the squad out a little.&nbsp; Also, with the slower pace, and cem effects, team work is pretty much the only way to achieve a solid victory.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok, I have to ask.&nbsp; What is Bunny Hopping?&nbsp; I have just completed basic traning, I tell you.&nbsp; This game takes a&nbsp; bit to get use too.&nbsp; I am trying to bone up so I can be semi-good for the lan party.&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;:D<br />I guess I need to download and install ET as well.&nbsp; I have never really played that game before either.<br /><br />Has a date been set for a lan party?<br /><br />Lee</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Out of curiosity, I did a stat fps on my Linux install and one of the Urban maps, I was getting anywhere from 19 to 40 FPS. That seemed a little low, so for comparison, I booted into Windows for the first time in about a month and installed it. On the same map I was getting 30 to 40 FPS higher consistently. I have an ATI Radeon 9800XT 256MB. I&#039;ve also noticed that Doom3 ran slower on the Linux install. Do you think that drivers are the issue here? I am currently saving up for a Geforce 6800GT since Nvidia&#039;s drivers are so much better for Linux. Do those of you with Nvidia cards notice any differences in performance between Windows and Linux?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Some games seem to look nicer in Windows, but I think that&#039;s not really a driver issue as much as the games are written to use more advanced FX under DirectX than they are when run under OpenGL.<br /><br />Nick<br /></div>

I&#039;ve seen a fairly noticeable difference in performance between Linux and Windows with the ATI drivers due to ati&#039;s fairly sad linux support.....&nbsp; performance between linux and windows with nvidia? dunno lol haven&#039;t booted windows on a machine with nvidia graphics in a few years :P <br /><br />but comparing machines that are pretty identical, performance in ET between linux and windows, fps runs pretty much side by side with almost dead equal hardware. <br /><br />I&#039;ve seen a little more stable fps(much less framerate drops in high action areas) in ET on linux compared to a friend of mine&#039;s almost dead even machine to mine, but still hard to judge unless was the same machine.<br /><br />don&#039;t know about AA though</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yes, and when you get said NV 6800 card, you shall donate thine old card to me!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />There are some perfomance tweaks you can do laying around the general linux section of forum.americasarmy.com that might help you.<br /><br />Oh btw, the reason performance in the windows version of ET so closely matches that of linux is ET does most of it&#039;s heavy lifting with a decent OpenGL engine.&nbsp; It&#039;s fairly well supported in linux.&nbsp; I&#039;m assuming however that AA justs uses wrappers to help with the directX calls, therefore it&#039;s certainly possible to loose fps, especially with crapy driver implimentations like ATI&#039;s</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Actually, from reading the AA forums, it seems that the current release is running slower under linux for most people. I think drivers have something to do with it, but AA may have some things going on for the Linux and Mac release of 2.50 that exaggerate the problem.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I got a question for all you AA vets out there :<br /><br />Why do people complain about Stun / Flash grenades? Maybe it was the three servers I went to, but, how come people actually assume the enemy [being I] is going to listen to them and not toss a stun grenade? Afterwards I got booted [For sucking horribly or using the stun grenade, I dont know which]<br /><br />Edit : Good god, am I late on this.<br /><br />And what servers do you recommend that I play on?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Birds will sing, dogs will bark, noobs will whine.<br /><br />Honestly, I don&#039;t often use grenades in AA, but when I do, 8/10 times I throw flashbangs.&nbsp; Flashbangs, I would argue, are more deadly than frags in AA.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Simple, you don&#039;t really have to cook them (though you can, for a VERY breif ammount of time).&nbsp; Since you don&#039;t have to cook them, they take less time to use, and therefore, you spend more time with your gun up, ready to kill. <br /><br />Example, I spend alot of time as a sniper in AA.&nbsp; Early on, that ment, I spent alot of time getting killed by rushers.&nbsp; Not anymore.&nbsp; Now, I&#039;ll actually run up, lob a flashbang so that it airbursts near the rusher, then run up, and no-scope the guy while he&#039;s helpless and blind&nbsp; &gt;:D. On other occasions, when I&#039;m unlucky enough to get flashbanged, I imediately pull out and throw both of my flashes.&nbsp; 6/10 the guy that flashed me is caught exposed, running in for the kill, and gets blinded.&nbsp; Then it&#039;s my turn to pop him from behind cover&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />About the only time I use frags, is either when the enemy is camping out somewhere, or I have a bud covering me.&nbsp; &nbsp;Since you have to cook a nade for 5 clicks, it&#039;s beter to use against timid, stationary targets.<br /><br />As for servers, I recommend you start out on the non-sf maps, and hone your skills on mout, insurgent camp, bridge, weapons cache and the like.&nbsp; </div>
