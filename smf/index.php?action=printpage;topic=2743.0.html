					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I use OpenBSD and PF for all my firewalls I actually build and sell commercial firewalls.<br />I use carp now set up as failover hot/hot setup and in three levels so from outside in there is three levels of protection and multiple ids and tripwire running. If I have a primary failure of all my systems it will boot to a frazierwall linux based firewall floppy distro for ruduncay.<br /><br />If you need a nice distro I reviewed some of them here http://www.pcolalug.org/smf/index.php?topic=3067<br />see presentation Chapter 1 firewalls.</div>
