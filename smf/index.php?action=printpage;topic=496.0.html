					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">But for a couple hundred more, you can get this (http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/77/wo/zW1XkDTHvpP72lvZyl2YC4iSKDX/1.3.0.3.27.21.1.0.19.3.1.1.0?45,17). From what I understand from reading /. (I know, I know...), the iBook is a better deal. As we know, MHz isn't the whole story, and benchies seem to indicate that the processor in the Lindows machine is equivalent to a 400-500 MHz Celeron/Duron.<br /><br />What is neat is that Lindows has done what other mainstream distros might want to think about: getting manufacturers to put their software on compatible, tested systems, pre-configured, and at an affordable price. I know Mandrake and Lycoris have versions of the Wal-Mart PC, and Lycoris was actually offering some notebooks and desktops pre-configured long before this Wal-Mart deal (the pc's in question were really under-powered and a few generations behind the curve, IIRC).<br /><br />So, I see an opportunity for a OEM to break out by partnering with these distros and offering a complete line of rigs. I know if there were quality pre-configured PC's and laptops, at price points comparable to Dell/Gateway/whoever, the geek market would be wrapped up. Now, if RH, Mandrake, SuSE, Xandros, and the other distros (ones with a little more &quot;street cred&quot; in the community than Lindows) can take this page out of Lindows playbook, we could have a pc panacea!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">When I say I would buy this, the first thing I thought of was taking Lindows off and putting a different distro on it. I think of all the distribution companies, Redhat would be the best on to produce a mainstream ready system able to compete with Dell/Gateway/et al. I think they have the most public recognition of all the linux brand names and have the most money to back such a move.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here's something else for you. &nbsp;HP and Linux (http://h10018.www1.hp.com/wwsolutions/linux/products/clients/clientscert.html) &nbsp;HP offers a line of Compaq computers with 3 different distros. &nbsp;Red Hat, Mandrake, and SuSE are available for these computers. &nbsp;Also, the HP line has Caldera/Debian, RH, Mandrake, SuSE, and TurboLinux.... The only problem is the fact that it IS NOT PREINSTALLED. &nbsp;But the distro cds are included with the computer in the box. &nbsp;$534 + S&H will have it at your door.</div>
