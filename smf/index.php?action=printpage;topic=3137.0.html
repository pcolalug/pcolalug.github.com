					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok we have a system in house the Xcelerator by virtical and you can make a call to anywhere in the world SIP to SIP without a carrier.<br />As long as you both have an IP you are good to go. If you want the abiltiy to call land lines then you either need carrier like skype or connect your system to your copper lines. Of course at that time it does not become free. But for a neat alterantive you could send a phone to a person you talk to a lot or a friend around the world or several friends and have group conversations. Very cool! Or you could simply download free soft phones to your computer and get a good headset with mic :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Peach, I know you&#039;re a KDE guy. I found you Twinkle (http://www.twinklephone.com/). Basically, you need any SIP based softphone from the way it sounds. Most of the VoIP networks use SIP, except Skype, which uses its own proprietary protocols stack.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks Rugmonster.<br /><br />I will give it a look see. I am temporarily running Ubuntu for a project and it has Ekiga installed. I will look at that too.<br /><br />I am still using VoicePulse* as my VoIP provider. They allow SIP soft phones to work on their network. There are a couple of features that I am looking for. When I get back from my trip in a couple of weeks I will give these a thorough looking into.<br /><br />*See our very long VoIP thread. http://www.pcolalug.org/smf/index.php?topic=1819.0</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just to make sure we are clear here!<br />SIP to SIP you DO NOT need a provider other than your regular internet.<br />If you want to call other than SIP then you will need a provider or a system in your house connecting to the phone system copper.<br /><br />This conversation sparked from someone telling me that you could not use a SIP phone to SIP phone without carrier.<br /><br />I am actually fixing to buy both a usb phone for my laptop than runs with linux and a wireless clamshell that you can use anywhere there is<br />an open AP. getting a good deal thru company.<br /><br /></div>

My interest is SIP to regular phone. Not SIP to SIP, that is why I keep bringing up the provider.<br /><br />SIP to SIP holds no interest to me. I use Skype for that. Though I think that SIP to SIP is a great thing, it is practically worthless for my needs.</div>
