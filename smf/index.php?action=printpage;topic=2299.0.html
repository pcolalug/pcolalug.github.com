					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">While on the lookout for linux laptops I've come across companies selling desktops with linux, I'll post links here to them for people interested as I run across them.<br /><br />The Dell n-series:<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Dell PrecisionTM &nbsp;n series1 workstations deliver maximum workstation performance. Smart for businesses with proprietary software images or special Linux needs, these systems come without a Microsoft® &nbsp;operating system. PrecisionTM &nbsp;n series systems are available with factory installed Linux.<br /></div><br /><br />Click here for more info (http://www1.us.dell.com/content/products/compare.aspx/desktops_n?c=us&amp;cs=04&amp;l=en&amp;s=bsd).<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">On the desktop you have many different options. &nbsp;You can build your own, you can have someone build a system for you (as long as your guidelines aren't to stringent this can be cheap). &nbsp;Or, you could just run linux on a generic pc which is probobly the easiest thing to do. &nbsp;Lastly, you could by a special linux pc from a maker. &nbsp;<br /><br />But let's be honest here, this isn't solaris. &nbsp;This OS was designed from the ground up to run on generic hardware, so unless your buying a laptop, this is the most expensive and probobly most underperforming option for the money.<br /><br />So here's my breakdown, if i were building a system for gaming/linux, I'd build it myself, or at least order it custom built so that i could have it to my specifications. &nbsp;If i just wanted to run linux? &nbsp;Well, I've ran linux on some pretty old and 'out of date' hardware. &nbsp;If i wasn't interested in pc gaming at all I'd just go with a base system with a cdrw/dvd drive.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">But if I were a large company and wanted ease of management, I would buy something like that listed on the site. Single image for install is very very nice. Imagine processing of new systems going from 4 systems a day to 40 via system images (Balad Air Base, Iraq).</div>
