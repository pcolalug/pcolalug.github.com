					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I had a drive go wierd this week. After several tests, I found out that the partition table was corrupt or missing. I needed to restore the partition table, or pull the data off before formatting. Since getting the partition table restored seemed to be impossible (based on two opinions that I respect), then getting the data off was my next choice.<br /><br />Newton found this utility (http://www.pcinspector.de/file_recovery/UK/welcome.htm). It works in Windows (I am sure there is something like it in Linux). &nbsp;This tool was able to see the drive though it was not &quot;mountable.&quot; I then went in and pulled files off to my secondary hard drive. Since my drive was in tact but not bootable/mountable, I was able to get my files. If the drive has been fdisked, but not reformatted, they say you can still get the files off. <br /><br />From what I could tell, it scans your drive for boot records/partition information, even though the partition table was not readable by the system. Then it builds it's own partition table (but does not restore the damaged drive). The purpose of the software is to just be able to get to your data. You cannot do any type of repair on the drive with this utility.<br /><br />Saved my hide, I thought I would share.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Was that a freeware program or pay? I had a guy the other day who had the FAT table on a floppy go bad and I probably could have used that. The only solution I could find you had to pay for and the squadron wasn't willing to buy it. I would like to find a utility to keep around, just in case. <br /><br />I'm glad you were able to get your stuff off that drive, though. I can only imagine what I would do if that happened to me. You would be seeing one freaked out Ruggy.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It is freeware. If it were my machine, I would take my lumps for not backing up and just format the machine (done it many times).<br /><br />But being my parent's machine, and never having given them a course on backups, I felt like I ought to try all I can to get the information for them. Worked perfectly.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Backups? What are those? &nbsp;:lol: <br /><br />At home, I rarely back anything up. I guess I have so much that I want backed up that it would take a couple of 8 gig tapes. My resume and important documents, I save to multiple systems, but that is only because I don't dare trust floppies. I hate those buggers and it seems like in the past few years they have seemed to go down in quality and getting corrupted a lot quicker.</div>
