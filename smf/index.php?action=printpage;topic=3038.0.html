					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Now, assembly isn&#039;t a complete mystery to me, but it&#039;s close.&nbsp; Is there any place on the internets that has a good Z80 tutorial?<br /><br />(No, this isn&#039;t for TI calcs, this is actually for Gameboys.)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don&#039;t know what you have looked at so far, but I found two Gameboy development sites that seem to have some tutorials and how-tos. One looks like it even has a forum. They may be able to steer you in a better direction unless the LUG has some embedded device programmers. Anyways, the two sites are GameBoy Dev&#039;rs (http://www.devrs.com/gb/) and gbadev.org (http://www.gbadev.org/). Hope that helps.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Not sure if it will help, but look for Assembly language on the TRS-80 Models I, III or IV. All of them used a Z80, and at one time I was pretty good at it too. :)<br /><br />I&#039;ll check my library at home and see if I have anything left over (beside my Model IV).<br /><br />Jesse<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don&#039;t want to side track your post, but depending on your motivation for wanting to learn assembly, you might be better off using that time learning C, and using one of the many excellent compilers for that processor.&nbsp; <br /><br />If it&#039;s the learning experience you&#039;re after, go for it.&nbsp; It&#039;ll give you a better fundamental understanding of what goes on behind the scenes, and make it easier for you to optimize code.&nbsp; However, if your learning it just to write software for it, I&#039;d recommend using C.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Mostly because I&#039;d like to anaylize already compiled code on Gameboys.<br /><br />I know obviously what a ld or an inc or a jmp etc.&nbsp; does, I&#039;m just not strong and chaining them together and following the program flow.</div>
