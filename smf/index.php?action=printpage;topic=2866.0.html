					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It is official. The Internationl Standards Organization has granted an ISO number to the OpenDocument (http://www.openoffice.org/press/iso_pr.html) file formats. This has been in discussion for some time, but it is now official. For software to be ISO compliant (which nothing says they have to be) they will have to use the OOo OpenDocument file formats. Great news I think.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Does open document cover other areas such as spread sheet, powerpoint and db access?<br /><br />Honestly, support for word processor documents has gotten good enough, what we need is a universal standardization for *all* office formats.</div>

But, here is a quote from that article.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">The International Standards Organisation has today approved a standard file format to be used worldwide for the storage of files produced by office software (word processor documents, spreadsheets, presentations, drawings, etc.).</div><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: Brent</div><div class="quote">Honestly, support for word processor documents has gotten good enough...</div><br />In what way? I don&#039;t know of a standard file format in the word processor field. There is the de facto standard of MS Doc, but since it is a closed format and no one is allowed to make a 100% compatible file, then that is not a good option. RTF is a better choice, but it has never really caught on. I have always seen it as limited in my mind, I really don&#039;t know how limited it is.<br /><br />This is a great step. It may not be adopted by MS, but having ISO back it, it will be adopted by other software manufacturers.</div>
