					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Anyone that every mucks in the command line needs to check out the article, Learn 10 good UNIX usage habits (http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-badunixhabits.html?ca=lnxw01GoodUnixHabits), from IBM developerWorks. I think this is going to get bookmarked and referred back to from time to time.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That&#039;s a great list.<br /><br />I think something like this would be a great meeting topic. I know if I had someone sit down with me and hold my hand through a few sessions of the &quot;grep&quot; command I might understand what it is for and how to work it. I don&#039;t really even know what it is capable of and therefore only use it when told to do so through IRC or a step by step web page.<br /><br />I think sometimes we forget that there is a whole world out there filled with people that don&#039;t even understand the basics.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">grep is used to find a pattern(s) in one or more files.<br /><br />English translation, lets you search for a word, number, or combination of numbers, letters and characters.<br /><br />So say you want to see what your home directory is in /etc/passwd without opening the whole file, you can quickly grep it.<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">$ grep &quot;givensdj&quot; /etc/passwd<br />givensdj:blah blah blah:/home/givensdj<br /></div><br />Often times, if I know there is a configuration option in a file, but not entirely sure which file it&#039;s in, I&#039;ll go to the directory that holds all of the configuration files and run a grep, like so...<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">$ grep -R &quot;configure_option&quot; /etc</div><br />If the pattern is found in a file, it will tell me which file it is and then I can do what I need to do with it. By the way, the -R flag tells it to search recursively through all subdirectories in /etc.<br /><br />Another thing I find myself using it for a lot is finding where a function is defined in source code, or where a CSS class or id is defined. grep, cat, sed, awk, and find are my most used &quot;advanced&quot; command line tools above all others. There is so much you can do with them, especially when you string them together. A lot of the stuff you might use perl for can be done with these commands.<br /></div>

Now I guess I can do it with grep, cat, sed, awk, and find.<br /><br />Thanks for the tip. :D</div>
