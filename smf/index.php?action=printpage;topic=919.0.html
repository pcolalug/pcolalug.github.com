					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am so thoroughly angered with the installation process that if I hadn't paid for the Red Hat Linux 9 Bible I would throw it in the trash &amp; break the CD's that came with it.<br /><br />I have tried 6 times now to install this OS &amp; every time I get an error that one of the 1,000+ packages has caused a fatal error that forces me to reboot &amp; start over.<br /><br />This wouldn't be so bad if I were given the choice to abort that particular package and continue with the other many packages. But NO.. it shuts everything down.<br /><br />And is it really that hard to allow a person to select all of the packages in one category with one click? &nbsp;It is very stupid of whomever put this together that I have to go into each category &amp; click on every program that isn't already selected by default. &nbsp;There should be a &quot;Select All&quot; &amp; &quot;Unselect All&quot; button within each category.<br /><br />For now my next time attempting this will be just the &quot;Minimal&quot; selection at the bottom of the page. &nbsp;Hopefully RedHat can finally show me what it's made of.. at least whatever &quot;minimal&quot; actually works.<br /><br />Zyman</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I got RH 9 installed onto my laptop without a hitch. &nbsp;Just wanted to play with KDE 3.1.3 and see the latest enhancements Apple contributed back to Konqueror. &nbsp; &nbsp;I've gotten a different theme, cleaned up the menus, and finally have KDE to a state where I don't mind using it. &nbsp;I've been using it for about a week now without a problem. &nbsp;(For those who haven't read: Apple has decided to use khtml - the konqueror html rendering engine - for their own browser. &nbsp;What this means is finally some of the nasty rendering bugs and stability problems should get worked out of konqueror.)<br /><br />Anyways the point is it's finally at a place where (for me anyways) I would consider it a worthy alternative to Gnome. &nbsp;Now I just need to wait a few weeks while the gnome packages become available, because gnome has some nice changes working down the pipe as well. &nbsp;We'll see. &nbsp;As for now I have KDE on the laptop and Gnome on the desktop and enjoy both.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've had this happen to me before in the past. &nbsp;I'm not sure if the option is still there in RH9, but I've found that running the 'verify cd' option that the installer presents you with at the beginning is often helpful before commiting to an install.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">One of the main reasons that I don't like RedHat is it's installer. It may be a good system, and the installer has worked for me, I just don't like it. Their partitioning software choice (what do they use again?) maybe better than the one that Mandrake uses, but it is the same interface now that they had 6 years ago when I first started looking at Linux. (OK, maybe not that bad). Stick with the partitioner if you want, but give us a nice interface.<br /><br />I don't run RedHat because I don't like installing RH. Mandrake may not be any better to use, and maybe not as mature as RH, but I like the install better. Therefore, until RH really changes it's install, I will continue to run Mandrake.<br /><br />I know that did not contribute to the topic at hand, but it was an opportunity to air my thoughts.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello all you wonderful Linuxians,<br /><br />Well I am just celebrating about the best OS ever made. &nbsp;Here have a cigar &amp; a beer while I tell you.<br /><br />It's the best product on the market. &nbsp;It only took me 7 attempts to finally go thru the installation without a fatal error that rebooted the whole process.<br />Now not to mention that each installation was roughly 30-45 minutes of my time because my time is such an endless resource to use so thats not really a reasonable point.<br /><br />So yes I was so happy to follow the &quot;Bible&quot; that told me to verify each CD at least once before use and of which my DVD drive never said, &quot;Get this out of me!!&quot;<br /><br />And O you just don't know the pleasure of using the &quot;Everything&quot; option just for it to crash on OpenOffice. &nbsp;It thrilled my soul to go thru the different categories like Administrative, Games, Desktop, etc and have to click all the programs within every category that don't get selected by default.<br /><br />Hey.. If it's not pathetic or stupid tasks... It's not RedHat Linux 9. &nbsp;So I want you all to congratulate me for installing the MINIMAL selection of which I can only boot up into Text Mode Interface and I don't even understand 1% of the command structure.<br /><br />Please no applause.. just toss me your money so that you too can share in the wondrous joy of RH9. &nbsp;And keep the cigars; the partying is all on me.<br /><br />Zyman</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey hey! If you keep it like that, you can really <i>learn</i> linux. Too many people can't/won't use the CLI and the wonders it holds. (Just so you know, three of my four systems are CLI only).<br /><br />Should you choose to stay with RH, you can discover the wonders of &quot;dependency hell&quot; and the wonders of its vastly inferior package management system. <br /><br />And one final note, RPMs <b><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.3em;">SUCK</span></b>. I would rather have no package management or very minimal such as Slackware than to have to deal with any RPM system.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you're having that big a problem installing and your CD/DVD's check out OK then most likely you have a hardware problem on your machine or some sort of incompatibility with the installer's kernel. &nbsp;<br /><br />You can try disabling your secondary cache in your bios, disabling ACPI, disable uDMA access on the drives, whatever. &nbsp;Point is the installation process is very capable of killing an unstable system. &nbsp;<br /><br />My little web server (which was originally a 75mhz pentium now magically running a 450mhz AMD chip, I still haven't figured that out seeing as how the manufacturer says it doesn't support 100mhz bus) would reboot mid install, everytime, on every distribution. &nbsp;I finally disabled all the cache in the bios and it installed perfectly. &nbsp;After installation I re-enabled the cache and everything is happy.<br /><br />Or try another distribution. &nbsp;Maybe I recommend slackware? &nbsp;If you want to learn linux, then slackware / gentoo / some other clean implementation are the only way to go. &nbsp;If you install redhat you're only going to learn how redhat's configuration tools work, and you'll probably be lost on most other systems. &nbsp;Not a bad thing if you just wanna use linux, but if you truely wanna learn about UNIX like systems, there really is a better way :) <br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">While we're talking about RPMs and dependencies and all, I'll add my $0.02 in as well, and give a plug for synaptic (http://www.nongnu.org/synaptic/index.html) -- a nifty front-end gui for apt that works under RPM-based systems as well, should you happen to swing that way.<br /><br />But I'll agree with Rugmonster on this one. &nbsp;RPMs (IMHO) usually end up being a bad thing.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay maybe pure BS here so someone check and let us know. &nbsp;But doesn't RedHat (at least the newest release, 9) have something called apt-rpm? &nbsp;And if so, does that handle dependency resolutions and such?<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yes, apt-get does work for rpm's...but it isn't something that is configured and used by default. Yes, there are wonderful *GUI* tools out there, but to use straight RPM, the Redhat Package Manager, you run into dependency hell and as far as I know, apt-get is not included or configured in a default Redhat setup...let alone a minimal one. Also, is there a large repository of packages like Debian or Gentoo has for rpms? I know there is rpmfind, but I've had problems find stuff there that was available in Debian's repositories. Apt doesn't work unless you tell it where to look.<br /><br />And one more thing, has anyone actually tried to make an rpm or deb? deb's are so much nicer and supposedly gentoo's packages are supposed to be even nicer than debs. <br /><br />Hooray for crappy package management! Yeah, Windows beats Linux out there. Can you click Next?<br /><br />Finally, I tell people to learn the CLI way of things because you won't necessarily have those pretty GUIs on other systems. If you ever plan on administering another flavor of unix or systems for a company, you more than likely will not have those tools, but the CLI and config files will be there. Believe it or not, a lot of these packages we use on Linux are ported to other systems. What do you do when you have a system 3000 miles away and all you can do is SSH in? Unless you have bandwidth and system to spare, tunneling X isn't always the best option.<br /><br />My $50.02.</div>
