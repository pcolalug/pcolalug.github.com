					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It&#039;s that time again! Time for our ever popular LAN Party/Meeting!&nbsp; This time we plan to have available the ever-popular Enemy Territory; True Combat: Elite, an ET Total Conversion Mod; America&#039;s Army; and for fun, Parsec.<br /><br />For a kick, I plan on bringing an N64, and anyone with one and a game they would like to play, bring the game and a controller or two! (I&#039;ve only got 2 controllers&nbsp; :D)<br /><br />For the meeting portion, we will follow our standard format, with a presentation (topic to be determined.)&nbsp; After the Meeting portion, if there is enough interest, I will attempt to head up a GPG keysigning party.<br /><br />As usual, it will be Bring Your Own &quot;Beverage,&quot; with a $5 kick-in for pizza, if you want pizza.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the skinny:<br /><br />Where: Jesse&#039;s House<br />When: December 17, 1400-2200 (2pm-10pm); 1800 (6pm) for the Meeting portion<br />Why: Cause it&#039;s fun!<br /><br /><br />We hope to frag you there!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I regret to announce that it looks like this month&#039;s meeting (and the LAN Party) will have to be postponed.&nbsp; We&#039;ve had some issues with getting a suitable site lined up.&nbsp; Jesse has some out-of-town business to attend to, and our other two most recent venues (SSI and APS) are not available for various reasons.<br /><br />I suspect that there may not have been the greatest turnout anyway, due to people being very busy with the Holidays.&nbsp; The 17th is a popular date for Christmas Parties, and a valuable shopping day.&nbsp; As of right now, we will plan to do the LAN Party at the January meeting, further details to be announced as we get closer to that date.&nbsp; This will give you a chance to get the new/upgraded system all tweaked up before trying to survive on the battlefield, too.&nbsp; &nbsp;;)<br /><br />Hope everyone has a great Holiday Season, and see you in January.<br /><br />Dan<br /><br /><br /></div>
