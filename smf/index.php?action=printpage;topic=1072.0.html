					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am going to try and be there, but depending on how many more maps I need to download will determine what time I can get on. I am going to be tied up till pretty close to 8:00, so I can't download till I get to the computer. (It is at someone else's place where the DSL connection is).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You'll need the latest version of ET (v 1.02) to join the server.. A link to download the patch can be found in this (http://www.pcolalug.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1012) thread.<br /><br />As for maps, look &nbsp;here (http://www.pcolalug.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=974) for info regarding the map rotation.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you just log into the server (it is up 24/7) then when it tells you there is a new version, you can just let it install. This is slower, but at least you know that it went the right place. Otherwise you can just download the patch and install it. It installs automatically.<br /><br />When you log into the server as if you are going to play a game, it will download the maps for you. This I am not sure about, but I suspect is much slower than downloading the tarball. <br /><br />Server is: 68.99.60.104</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Since the server is patched to 1.02, you cannot connect to it with an unpatched (original) version of ET. &nbsp;There is no auto-download for that.<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sorry, I could not make it. My computer/dsl owner had to take his son to the Dr. I tried to convince him that letting my play ET with you folks was much more important than his son needing to go to the Doc, but he would have none of that. Third week in a row that I have been ready to play, but have been unable to for some reason or another.<br /><br />Maybe next week.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">lloyd, have you checked the IP address after you type it in? I dont know why, but on most all the installations I have done, when I type in the address the last three digits get changed from 104 to 140 after I type them in. I then have to click in that box and keep typing until it finally gives me the right numbers.<br /><br />I dont know if that might be the problem. Has anyone else experienced this?</div>
