					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I figured this was pretty newb-ish so I'd ask here. &nbsp;I've made my swaret.conf and put VERSION=10.0 and left the rest of the file alone since it seems to automagickally go to www.linuxpackages.net and so forth. &nbsp;Well, for whatever reason, I'll do something like:<br /><br />&quot;swaret --install k3b&quot;<br /><br />...and it will find absolutely nothing matching k3b. &nbsp;However, I pull up Firefox and head over to Linuxpackages.net, search for k3b for Slack v10.0 and it pulls it easily. &nbsp;What's up?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don't have my Slack box up right now, but I think what you need to do is something like: swaret --update. I am not sure if that is the right command, but it is something like that. That will update the list of available packages. Then you can install.<br /><br />You may have already done that step, but I thought I would mention it.<br /><br />Frankly, I got tired of swaret never having the package I was looking for, so I have gotten to where I compile everything from source on my own. I absolutely hate that since swaret is one of the compelling reasons to run Slack. I just got tired of stuff not being there, so I don't even look anymore.</div>

You may provide some insight to my own problems.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hmm, I've tried yours as well as the one included there (ftp rather than http) and still no dice. &nbsp;I've also tried out the swaret --update after each modification and still no dice.<br /><br />Oh, I DID make a modification to your line. &nbsp;Instead of -10.0 at the end I used -$VERSION. &nbsp;I figured it would allow me to update the version easier because I'd be bound to forget I hard-coded it someday.<br /><br />My test is &quot;swaret --install mplayer&quot; and &quot;swaret --install Mplayer.&quot; I know this package exists at LinuxPackages.net so I figured it was a decent test. &nbsp;Any thoughts?<br /><br />EDIT: &nbsp;I just noticed that when I ran the update after using the repository you listed it failed on checking the respository files. &nbsp;However, I removed the &quot;1&quot; that you had after &quot;www&quot; and it apparently worked through that section of the update.</div>
