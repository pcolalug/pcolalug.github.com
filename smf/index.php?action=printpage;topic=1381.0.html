(I know it says 14days but it free forever. thats just to scare ppl into whippin out the CC's)<br /><br />Theres two whole Server of fun to be had!<br /><br />Scorpius: Older Players and Adults mainly..... a few kids but we teach them respect.<br />Pheonix: If you get lower than a 24 on an IQ test plz play here.<br /><br />Im on both servers (Nexus on Scorp and Muaddib on Pheonix) look me up and i'll hook you up if you used me as a sponsor. <br /><br />Oh god what have i done??? more hS addicts are sure to follow :\</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Oh my lord how i've tried...<br /><br />The webpage itself is the problem the hsclient.exe will run in wine but the Portal is needed to update the auth file(launch.hs) the page checks for this: Windows98 or higher, IE6.0+, and ActiveX to load the character selection screen.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey it actually works flawlessly with Crossover Office's version of wine.<br /><br />Installing(http://www.homeweb.org/~imnes/tmp/winegame/Screenshot1s.jpg) (http://www.homeweb.org/~imnes/tmp/winegame/Screenshot1.jpg)<br /><br />Starting(http://www.homeweb.org/~imnes/tmp/winegame/Screenshot2s.jpg) (http://www.homeweb.org/~imnes/tmp/winegame/Screenshot2.jpg)<br /><br />Playing(http://www.homeweb.org/~imnes/tmp/winegame/screenshot3s.jpg) (http://www.homeweb.org/~imnes/tmp/winegame/screenshot3.jpg)<br /><br />The in-game screenshot looks weird because the only way I could figure out how to capture it was to resize the desktop, start gimp, and take a screenshot with it since the game was running full screen, normally your screen would be resized and the game would take the whole screen.<br /><br />Have sound and everything working. <br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If I could only get IE6 to work right now... &nbsp;Part of a work around to get Valve's Steam Client to work with Wine was installing IE6(True Type Fonts or something) and dcom98 for a few required dlls.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I haven't tried it with the standard wine install but I can give that a try this weekend. &nbsp;I'm sure you'll have to use some windows DLLs to get it working, but if you have a copy of windows that's not a problem.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Glad to hear you've got a ray of hope, there, modki, but can we keep the ms bashing out of it? I think the comment about Bill Gates and your intentions was a bit inapropriate for these forums.</div>
