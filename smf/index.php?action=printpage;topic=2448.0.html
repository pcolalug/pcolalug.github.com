					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've just recently gotten back into desktop linux. I've always run a linux box on my network and it has always been integral to the operation of many of my home networking projects, but I wasn't so much of a fan of it on the desktop for several years. Now, I'm back and enjoying Gnome 2.10 on SuSE 9.3, yet I still have a Windows XP system because there are times that I need something over there and my girlfriend wasn't quite ready to learn something new. That was until last night...<br /><br />I was working on getting my profile on the WinXP system transferred to my account for my new Samba domain and found a temporary directory that I couldn't delete. I then realized I couldn't even open it or take ownership. I did a search for the directory name and every hit made mention of spyware. <br /><br />I was livid. I was running Webroot's Spysweeper to protect myself from these sorts of things. I made sure my definitions were up to date and ran a full scan. It didn't find anything, so I downloaded the Microsoft Antispyware utility that is still in beta. I ran a quick scan and it found nothing, so I made it run a full scan and it FINALLY found it! <br /><br />I managed to get it cleaned off, but I was up to 2:30am trying to get it off of my system. Then I had the &quot;Come to Jesus&quot; moment; what had that thing collected and sent off to some far off place on the internet. I know I've put in my credit card number, social security number, bank account information and more through my browser. Luckily, the malware I had didn't include a keylogger (from what I could find out), but what if it did? I thought I was protected. Neither me nor my girlfriend use IE. I run SpySweeper and Symantec Antivirus all the time and do regularly scheduled sweeps. Why deal with that hassle at all?<br /><br />After talking to my girlfriend about it this morning, I'm going to show her how to use my Linux desktop and we're going to do financial and otherwise sensitive Internet transactions on it. I'm going to do my best to harden the Linux box and lock down my outgoing network. Possibly setup a filtering web proxy. Security just became even more real to me. I never thought I would feel this insecure on my home network, but I do and I'm doing something about it. I just wanted to share.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The only reason I still have a windows 2000 partition is for gaming. &nbsp;Windows has become my 'toy' os. &nbsp;Ironic, since linux started out as my 'hobby OS'<br /><br />Dan and David helped set me up with true type fonts in OO. &nbsp;I probobly won't even have to go to the computer lab anymore (I hate office 2003 (CGS 2570)).<br /><br />Still, Linux can't protect you from everything. &nbsp;A buddy of mine got a email from 'ebay' saying that there had been fraduelent activity on his account. &nbsp;He clicked on the link, and entered his info. &nbsp;<br /><br />He told me about it. &nbsp;Well later on that day I check my argo account, and lo and behold, I have one too! &nbsp;Well, see I never told ebay about my uwf email account. &nbsp;I click on the link to check it out, it looks legit except there's an ip address up in the addressbar. &nbsp;I'm suspicous now, I do a whois lookup, and lo and behold it's registered to some guy in china.<br /><br />I've seen this kinda thing alot over the past 5 years, but this was the most legit looking attempt i've seen. &nbsp;(See, the communists ARE out to get us!)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Social engineering I feel I can deal with; but when I can get any myriad of malware on my system from just using it for day to day, use all the while running extra software, eating more memory (SpySweeper sometimes used upwards of 80 MEG!) and slowing down my system as a whole, I realized I was in a losing battle. I'm very thankful that desktop Linux is at the maturity it is now to make it an acceptable and welcome alternative.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've got 9.3 Pro and it works pretty good. &nbsp;I got it to use Gnome 2.10, the only gripe I've got with it is their menu layout. &nbsp;I'm still trying to figure out how to get the default Gnome menu system in there. &nbsp;But otherwise everything works great. &nbsp;<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you want to change the layout of your menus, unfortunately, Gnome 2.10 has no menu editing utility. Menus, however, are done according to the Freedesktop Menu Specification. You can edit the file /etc/xdg/menus/applications.menu.gnome to change the placement of your application items.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I haven't tried it on any other distro yet, but someone is working on a Gnome based menu editor for Ubuntu. &nbsp;If you want to try it out (works fine in Ubuntu's 2.10 but haven't tried under SuSE yet), it's at:<br /><br />http://dev.realistanew.com/menu-editor/<br /><br />(http://dev.realistanew.com/menu-editor/menueditor.png)<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Seems like the idea behind it would be simple enough to do. Since every distro does things just a little differently, some tweaking may be needed. I'll have to download it and see if it works.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Freerock I believe included Denu Menu Editor into his FRG release of gnome. Atleast in the version I'm running, it is included but can't confirm if he continues to add it into his releases.</div>
