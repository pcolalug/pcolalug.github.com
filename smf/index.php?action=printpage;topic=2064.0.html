					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">They posted to another board that I am a member of, but used the name John over there.<br /><br />Seems like a huge waste of time. I don't know what they are trying to benefit from this. I will not buy their product if they spam me. I think alot of people are this way.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It is amazing - I mean, these people have to create the account manually to bypass the form &quot;injection&quot; filter, then go through the process of creating the message. But hey, I guess they'll do anything for a rubel.</div>
