My<br />favorite is the 'hide' tab that clears off most of the visible screen<br />space to let you get down to some serious reading. I also have found to<br />my surprise, that I may actually read some texts faster on monitor than<br />in hand. And while I must admit there is still something to pulling a<br />text down off the shelf and flipping through the pages, it is certainly<br />nice when I don't have to lug ten pounds of paper back and forth from<br />the office when I'm reading up on a particular subject or technology.&quot;<br /><br />You can also participate in this introductory program just for user<br />group members. To &quot;Go on Safari,&quot; any UG member who signs up for our<br />Safari 14-day free trial can send comments on their experiences, or<br />tips and tricks for how they used Safari &nbsp;(it only needs to be 2<br />sentences long, but it may be longer) to safari_talk@oreilly.com.<br />(Please include your UG name in the email.)<br /><br />Every week someone will be chosen from the tips or comments submitted<br />to receive fun stuff from O'Reilly (T-shirts, book bags, or other<br />surprises). If a member of your user group is selected, your group<br />receives free gifts, too. Whatever the individual member receives, your<br />UG will get one, too, to give away at your next meeting, or use however<br />you see fit. Recipients--and their comments--will be announced in the<br />User Group Newsletter.<br /><br />**Please use this special UG URL to sign up for the 14-day trial**<br />http://www.oreilly.com/safari/ug<br /><br />For more information on Safari:<br />http://safari.oreilly.com/<br />================================================<br />News From O'Reilly &amp; Beyond<br />================================================<br />---------------------<br />General News<br />---------------------<br />***Dispelling the Myth of Wireless Security<br />Rob Flickenger shows how to find out just how &quot;secure&quot; your standard<br />wireless network really is in this excerpt from his soon-to-release<br />&quot;Wireless Hacks.&quot;<br />http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/wireless/excerpt/wirlsshacks_chap1/index.html?CMP=NLC-UI6243101723<br /><br />Wireless Hacks<br />Order Number: 5598<br />http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/wirelesshks/<br /><br /><br />***And Don't Miss Rob Flickenger on SeattleWireless TV<br />The August installment of Seattle Wireless TV, which features an<br />interview with Rob Flickenger, as well as a discussion on a cool<br />remote-controlled helicopter with a wireless video feed, and reviews of<br />some of the latest wireless gear. &nbsp;<br />http://tv.seattlewireless.net/<br /><br /><br />***Trademarks<br />Cory Doctorow, who works with the EFF, wrote this article on the heels<br />of a rash of trademark incidents that he's encountered. His point of<br />view in this opinion piece is that trademark and copyright are supposed<br />to promote expression. He doesn't write about any specific details of<br />particular cases; rather, he restates an overview of these issues that<br />serves as his guiding light.<br />http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2003/08/14/trademarks.html?CMP=NLC-201PL0259145<br /><br />---------------------<br />Open Source<br />---------------------<br />***Guido van Rossum Speaks<br />Guido van Rossum, creator of the Python programming language, recently<br />announced that he'll be leaving PythonLabs to work for a California<br />startup. In this interview, Guido talks about the move, recent<br />developments, and Python in general.<br />http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2003/08/14/gvr_interview.html?CMP=NLC-WR2218661818<br /><br /><br />***PHP Security, Part 1<br />If you have users, you'll undoubtedly have bad guys trying to break<br />things. As a PHP developer, it's your responsibility to make sure your<br />code is secure. John Coggeshall demonstrates one common PHP error that<br />can leave you vulnerable, and he explains how to think like a bad guy<br />to prevent these mistakes in the first place.<br />http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/php/2003/07/31/php_foundations.html<br /><br /><br />***FreeBSD Access Control Lists<br />The Unix permissions model has worked for decades due to its flexible<br />simplicity. It's not the only approach, though. FreeBSD 5.0 supports<br />Access Control Lists, which allow for more flexible permissions. Daniel<br />Harris explains what ACLs can make easier.<br />http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/bsd/2003/08/14/freebsd_acls.html<br /><br />---------------------<br />Java<br />---------------------<br />*** Making Media from Scratch, Part 1<br />QuickTime is a media creation API. It supports far more than just<br />editing and playing movies -- you can create them, one frame at a time.<br />Chris Adamson demonstrates how to make moves from scratch with<br />QuickTime for Java.<br />http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/08/13/qtj_reintro.html?CMP=NLC-3RH891419319<br /><br />---------------------<br />.NET<br />---------------------<br />***Service-Oriented Architecture Explained<br />SOA (service-oriented architecture) has become a buzzword of late.<br />Although the concepts behind SOA have been around for over a decade<br />now, SOA has gained extreme popularity of late due to web services.<br />Before we dive in and talk about what SOA is and what are the<br />essentials behind SOA, it is a useful first step to look back at the<br />evolution of SOA. To do that, we have to simply look at the challenges<br />developers have faced over the past few decades and observe the<br />solutions that have been proposed to solve their problems.<br />http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2003/08/18/soa_explained.html<br /><br />---------------------<br />XML<br />---------------------<br />***Low Bandwidth SOAP<br />Using web services on low resource J2ME devices is possible through<br />Enhydra.org's KSOAP classes. This article shows you how to create<br />lightweight web service clients and servers.<br />http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2003/08/19/ksoap.html<br /><br />---------------------<br />Mac<br />---------------------<br />***Integrating QuickTime with Cocoa<br />After providing a brief QuickTime overview, Doug Welton shows you how<br />to integrate digital media with Cocoa, then finishes up with an example<br />of building a QuickTime Movie Player that you can include in your own<br />applications.<br />http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2003/08/15/quicktime_cocoa.html?CMP=NLC-YU0540798564<br /><br />================================================<br />News From Your Peers<br />================================================'<br />***SUCON '03 - Swiss Unix Conference 2003, Zurich, Switzerland--September 5<br />The Swiss Unix Conference is taking place for the first time.
