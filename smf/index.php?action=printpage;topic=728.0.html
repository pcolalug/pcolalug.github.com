					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sorry that took so long. We've got the dedicated server running (sans X). You can also get the full version of the game from ftp.inoch.com/games. <br /><br />You will need to connect to our ET server via the ip address 68.99.60.104, as we're sitll not showing up on the master list for some reason.<br /><br />My appologies again for this taking so long. Lets try again another night.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well.....it has been a &quot;fun&quot; couple of days. &nbsp;The hard disk (Maxtor 40 GB) in my Linux machine crashed. &nbsp;Never had that happen before, but this one bit it big time.<br /><br />Anyway, to make a long story short, I got a new hard drive and the RTCW server is back up and running. &nbsp;The IP address has changed however. &nbsp;The new IP and port &nbsp;is 24.117.85.58:27960 &nbsp;and the server name is still &quot;Newbie Slaughterhouse&quot;.<br /><br />I will &quot;soon&quot; have a Wolfenstein Enemy Territory server up and running as well. &nbsp;When I get it figured out and up, I will post an update on where to find it.<br /><br />Narsil</div>

But when going from fuel dump to gold rush (which is part of the north africa scenario, if played in standard 3-map campaign style), <i>everyone's</i> experience should be reset.<br /><br />That's how it should work, anyways.. I'm not sure what might be happening with your case though. &nbsp;Are you sure you even have XP to begin with, for one? &nbsp; :lol:</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yup, crowe is exactly right. &nbsp;There are two campaigns, &quot;Central Europe&quot; and &quot;North Africa&quot;. &nbsp; The European maps are Radar, Railgun, Fueldump (in that order I think), and the African maps are Oasis, Battery, Goldrush. &nbsp;You build up (and carry over) Experience Points during the 3 maps of each campaign, but everything zeros out when you switch to the other campaign. &nbsp;I &nbsp;&quot;think&quot; a server admin can change this (all six maps can be one campaign for example), but the stock setup is as described above. &nbsp;From what I've seen most servers run the stock setup.<br />Dan</div>

So I don't get in on all the action.<br /><br />After more research, I did find out, as you said crowe, that new points started with a new set of campaigns. Now my question is, how do people get those insane XPs?<br /><br />I only played about 5 minutes and had no XPs at the end of it. One of my teammates had 110 XPs. How does he do this so quickly? Is there a trick that I don't know? As a soldier I just kill people. As an engenier I build stuff. As a medic I heal people. But apparently I don't do it with the alacrity that others do.<br /><br />Maybe I need to head back to boot camp. Would it help if I had RTCW to practice with? Is it the same type game with the exception being that it is one player instead of multi?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: dpeach</div><div class="quote">Now my question is, how do people get those insane XPs?</div><br /><br />You get XP for a lot of things in ET. Engineers, Medics and Field Ops get lots of XP. As a Medic or Field Ops, they get XP for dropping items, reviving people, throwing air strikes, etc. Engineers get a lot of XP from building stuff and repairing stuff. They are pivotal in most maps and with one or two on a team, they are what get the objectives completed. Combine that with the fact that you get XP for being in the game without dying over time and XP for hits and kills and you can easily rack up some major XP. The key is not getting killed because you actually loose XP when you die.</div>

The difference is that it isn't in a campaign format and the classes are a little different. For shear experience with a first person shooter and getting used to the control, you can play RTCW or ET as the physics are mostly the same. I would suggest getting on the ET public servers and playing out there. Yes, you will die...a lot...but your skills will improve quickly. You will also get used to the classes, weapons and maps better. I mainly wouldn't recommend playing UT2k3 to get better at ET. Stick with either ET or RTCW.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have been playing the public servers when I am home. I just haven't been home the last two Thursdays to play with you guys. I plan on being there this week though. I hope to have a little more experience under my belt. I am working as a medic recently. I can shoot people just as well that way, and heal myself. I have got to learn how to quickly switch between syringe and machine gun. I end up getting toasted between poking my guys and shooting the enemy.</div>
