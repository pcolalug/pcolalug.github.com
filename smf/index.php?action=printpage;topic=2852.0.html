					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">First... I need to say that I don&#039;t mind trying to figure something out myself before asking for help. In fact, I have done that for the past three days now. Reading, and reading and reading so many threads, and web sites, and even rants.<br />I&#039;m trying to figure out how to get DVDs to play on my SuSe 10 system. I&#039;ve downloaded the MPlayer and tried to install it. Here is what I got for a reply:<br /><br />Failed dependencies:<br />w32codec-all is needed by MPLayer-1.Opre7try3-4<br />libmad.so.0 is needed by MPLayer-1.Opre7try3-4<br />libmp3lame.so.0 is needed by MPLayer-1.Opre7try3-4<br />libx264.so.45 is needed by MPLayer-1.Opre7try3-4<br />libxvidcore.so.4 is needed by MPLayer-1.Opre7try3-4<br /><br />What does all that mean? Where do I get these files? (they are files aren&#039;t they?) How do I install them? Where do I install them? Do I install them before I try to install MPlayer? If I install them and try to install MPlayer again, will I need to install yet again more files?<br /><br />All I want to do is play DVDs...you know, watch a movie on my computer.<br /><br />Is there a link, a thread, some easy to follow instructions where I can read them, and follow them. Kind of like assemblying a tool.... you know..... attach part A to part B. Now attach part AB to assembly C. something like that.<br /><br />thanks</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">http://brentnorris.net/dvd.html<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Also note that if you watch DVDs on a Linux machine in anyway that I know of you are breaking the DMCA as well. This is due to the fact that all Linux players I know of use source code to decode the DVD files, this is not the code that the MPAA has authorized and therefore according to the DMCA it is illegal.</div><br />So just be careful. You are commiting a federal crime by playing a DVD in Linux, and furthermore, you are announcing to the world in a public space that you are doing so. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">actually I&#039;m not watching anything DVD in Linux.&nbsp; &nbsp; Don&#039;t know how.<br /><br />it does sound a bit weird though.&nbsp; I can have a dual boot home computer; Windows and Linux, both on the same computer.&nbsp; If I use the Windows side to watch a DVD which I purchased legally, it&#039;s ok,&nbsp; if I watch the same DVD on the Linux side of the same computer, it&#039;s illegal.&nbsp; Yeah........ that makes sense. ??<br /><br />I know.......... not your law.... you&#039;re just advising of the law.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you&#039;re not watching anything DVD in Linux, then what are you trying to do? Make backups of your discs?<br /><br />The DMCA violation has to do with the fact that you are using a decryption method which has been reverse engineered. The reason it&#039;s legal under Windows or with any purchased DVD player is because the MPAA has licensed the decryption technique to the producer of the paid for product and makes a small amount of money for each unit sold. It&#039;s kind of old news, but the DMCA is evil because it stiffles innovation and puts corporate interest ahead of individual&#039;s rights of fair use, among other things.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">after I thought about it a bit I figured out it had nothing to do with me watching the video, and all about the movie industry getting royalties from software companies using the decoding technology.&nbsp; Like you said.... it&#039;s all about the money.<br /><br />oh, and thanks for pointing me to some clearly written, easy to understand and follow instructions.&nbsp; It took some doing, but after some time and effort....and some more dumb luck, I got it worked out.&nbsp; &nbsp; That web site was the best example of step by step instructions I&#039;ve come across in my many months of trying to learn how to do things in Linux.&nbsp; <br />After following the instructions carefully, I still was unable to get the DVD working properly.&nbsp; I used the information learned to find additional files, and then did an update to the system via Yast.&nbsp; It was taking a very long time so I just went to bed with it working.&nbsp; When I woke this morning I was prompted to reboot so I did.&nbsp; When I rebooted I tried the DVD and seemingly magically it worked.&nbsp; I guess the update and rebooting was what was needed.........not sure actually.<br /><br />The biggest obsticle I find, as a newbie to Linux, is that most of the advice, help, and instructions are written in a way that it is assumed that the learner (read newbie) knows already how to figure out where to install the files refered to, how to find dependent files for programs, and how to arrange them in the order necessary for the installation to work.&nbsp; <br /><br />I understand that it&#039;s our fault actually...... because as a newbie, we want to fix something, or install something.&nbsp; What we&#039;re looking to do is to get things up and running, and then we&#039;ll take the time to learn about compiling RPMs and learning CLI and such.&nbsp; When actually the reverse should be how it&#039;s done.&nbsp; However, it&#039;s just our nature to want something to work now, and then when we get the system working, then we&#039;ll take the time to learn how to work with it, adjust it, tweak it.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just for future reference, YaST will handle package dependencies for you if you use their repositories. Most distributions these days include dependency checking within their package manager and will go out and get those dependencies for you. Back in 2000 and 2001, I hated RPM based distros because they wouldn&#039;t do this and I got spoiled by apt in Debian. At the time, it was one of the only package managers that would do that. Now, Fedora has yum, SUSE has YaST, Gentoo has portage and they all do the same thing in a high level since. You request a package and it installs it and everything that depends on it.<br /><br />You are right about the wanting to get something to work now, learn the details later. To be honest, that&#039;s the way it goes. The thing to do is that when you are climbing that learning curve, you will find other things that will pique your interest. Make note of those and along the way toward those goals of making X, Y and Z work, you&#039;ll learn the basics. It doesn&#039;t hurt to read HOWTOs and Manpages. There is an art to reading manpages just like there is an art to searching Google. The way I started learning was by having a simple goal: make a linux firewall. In doing the reading on that, I discovered some other cool stuff a linux box could do. I picked one of those topics, and decided to make that work. Along the way to getting that working, I found out about other cool things. Before too long, I was running a small network of linux systems all doing different things. The learning curve can be steep, but the steep part isn&#039;t long. Once you get the feel for how linux works, it all flows pretty well from there.</div>
