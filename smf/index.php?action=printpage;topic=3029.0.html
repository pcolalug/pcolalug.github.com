					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The latest version of our favorite office suite has been released on its 6th birthday. Happy Birthday OOo!<br /><br />Supposed to be new features as well as some fixes. Here is the press release I got in my mail today.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">This is Friday 13 October and the day marks two important events: the immediate availability of OpenOffice.org 2.0.4 and our sixth anniversary.<br /><br />First things first.<br /><br />OpenOffice.org 2.0.4 is ready for download now. It is a significant release and recommended for all. As with all OpenOffice.org releases, it runs natively on Windows, Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X (X11) and many other platforms; and it probably runs in your language. Check with your favourite Native Language Project to see if the application is available today.<br /><br />New features, bugfixes, and improvements include:<br /><br />* Enhanced PDF management<br />* Direct export to LaTex<br />* Nested queries in Base<br />* New functionality in Calc and Impress<br />* Mac OS X (X11) uses system fonts<br />* And a lot more...<br /><br />But the most important is our improved use of extensions. We&#039;ve been very busy here, and have succeeded in making it easier for developers of any level to create extensions (aka &quot;packages&quot;) for OpenOffice.org. With 2.0.4, a new door to the future is opened: Developers everywhere are invited to start writing extensions! To learn more, visit our Extensions Project, http://extensions.openoffice.org/.<br /><br />Download the application now, start using it immediately, and write extensions tomorrow.<br /><br />* Download: http://download.openoffice.org/2.0.4/<br />* Release Notes: http://development.openoffice.org/releases/2.0.4.html<br /><br />And now our anniversary.<br /><br />Six years ago today, OpenOffice.org was launched as an open-source project. Wikipedia <ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><li type="circle"> has an excellent timeline, and in the last OOoCon we presented on the State of the Project [1], but the basic fact is that in the last six years we have helped shape a new world. Tens of millions of people use OpenOffice.org daily; governments have or are considering mandating it or its open-standard file format, the OpenDocument format, or ODF; and all have saved hundreds of millions of dollars and taken significant steps to ensuring that data is not lost to proprietary technologies. No small accomplishment.</li></ul><br />If you want to participate in this huge and peaceful movement for a better world, join us, spread the word, help us and yourself out.<br /><br />Build your world with OpenOffice.org.<br /><br /><br />-The OpenOffice.org Team<br /><br /><br /><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><li type="circle"> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenOffice.org</li>[1] http://www.openoffice.org/editorial/state_of_the_project_year_6.html<br /><br /></ul></div></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">WOOHOO<br />After siting on all these presentations forever and using Windows to make mine.<br />I am now using the great OpenOffice.<br />There was a mishap where I accidently downloaded the spanish version.<br />But atlast I downloaded the proper one for slack 10.2 and the rest is history.<br />So My 10 part presentation will all be in Opensource :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Have they stopped using that idiotic rpm format for the standard release yet?<br /><br />Honestly, I know it can be hard to supply a binary for all distros, but .bin shell installers work well, and are very nice.<br /><br />With regards to presentations, I&#039;ll be glad when impress correctly renders powerpoints as it should, and doesn&#039;t screw up text in certian situations.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">They still use the RPMs. Even though I use an RPM based system (at the moment), I still very much dislike that fact. The installer worked fine. I have seen more and more programs using installers which I think is a great step in the right direction. <br /><br />The best thing to do with the font problem is to get away from proprietary presentation software. Not always easy though. When MS opens up their file formats, then others can play fine.</div>
