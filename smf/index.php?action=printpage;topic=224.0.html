					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've been thinking about this file attach feature for the forum. Do we really need it? <br /><br />1. It still isn't going to allow us to embed pictures in our posts. (I haven't seen any forums where you can actually embed the pictures in a post. All of the pictures I've seen are actually linked from other sites)<br /><br />2. Due to bandwidth considerations, the file sizes would have to be limited to less than 1MB.<br /><br />3. File attaching would have to be limited to certain people. I don't want the law comming in and busting me because we have illegal files in our database.<br /><br />4. What sort of files, meeting the above criteria, do we need to post on this forum?<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Since:<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><li>Most ISP's provide web space</li><li>There are lots of spare boxen to host files between us</li><li>Not a whole lot of file transfers have been going on anyway[/list:u]I don't think that the benefits of file upload capabilities outweigh the drawbacks. Besides, Pizza Hut on Mobile Hwy has worked well for David and I for file/material transfer, with the added bonuses of being able to hang out with a fellow geek, and gluttony. ;)</li></ul></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Agreed, aside from my occasional picture post, I'm not even aware of file postings going on. &nbsp;And I have no problem hosting my own posts on one of my personal servers.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I agree that we are not in need of the feature. If I have a file that I need to make available, I can do that through my web site. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: rburt</div><div class="quote"> Besides, Pizza Hut on Mobile Hwy has worked well for David and I for file/material transfer...</div><br />I can make it just about anywhere in town (when I am home). I love transfering files while downloading grub.<br /><br />David</div>
