					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello again, I've got yet another issue. &nbsp;Finally getting back to setting up the Linux box some more (ready for prime time file server and audio recording hopefully) and I was lucky enough to come across an nVidia GeForce 2 MX AGP card with only 32MB of memory. &nbsp;Why lucky? &nbsp;'Cause the ******* that built this box put in a motherboard that couldn't handle more onboard memory than that...I'm still pretty mad about it, but whatever, at least I got a card that doesn't shut down the board upon booting now.<br /><br /><br />However, I've never installed a new graphics card under Linux before, so I did what any experienced Winblows user does: &nbsp;go to the source, get the latest drivers, do what they say, reboot, hope it works. &nbsp;Well, I got to the third step and that's where I'm stuck.<br /><br />I'm on as root, I'm running Slackware, and running the driver setup program from /root/System/. &nbsp;I tell it the kernel source path is /usr/src/linux-2.6.4 (which is where it is). &nbsp;I run the installer, it tells me it can't find a kernel module (no surprise) so it tries to build one. &nbsp;It gets done with building it, then dies on me saying that it couldn't properly make the nvidia.ko module.<br /><br /><br />Well, I took a look in the /var/nvidia-log-thingy-whatever and it says what really happened was it compiled it fine but couldn't &quot;insert&quot; it properly.<br /><br /><br />I'm hoping I'm going through the steps correctly thus far but I can't get past this part. &nbsp;Any help? &nbsp;I'd really appreciate it. &nbsp;I can't wait to have X running faster than a crawl 'cause integrated video SUCKS.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Do you have everything compiled into the kernel (no modules)? If so, later 2.6 kernels won't make/configure the code to load modules, even if you've selected to support module loading. This is recent, I think. I had a similar problem and decided to compile all my ALSA stuff as modules. Worked after that.<br /><br />If this is not the case and you're getting a message like &quot;incorrect module format&quot;, then you need a small patch for your kernel. I can't seem to locate it atm, but if you shoot me an email/pm, I can email it to you when I get home this afternoon.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I know the nvidia video drivers work in Slackware 9.1 because I've installed it myself. &nbsp;(You are on slack 9.1 right?)<br /><br />From the console, run uname -a and make sure the linux version of the running kernel exactly matches the sources you're compiling against. &nbsp;<br /><br />You might have a symlink pointing to the old kernel sources something like:<br /><br />/usr/src/linux -&gt; /usr/src/linux-2.4.22<br /><br />Remove that symlink completely, that's what I do and it's never caused me trouble. &nbsp;<br /><br />But I suspect there's a mismatch in your running kernel and installed sources version, because the driver installer should detect and find the correct sources installed without you having to specify.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Alright, definitely have the 2.6.4 kernel. &nbsp;I also redid the link for /usr/src/linux -&gt; /usr/src/linux-2.6.4.<br /><br />I built just about everything into the kernel because when I built even a FEW things as modules it didn't work at ALL. &nbsp;The kernel didn't even boot. &nbsp;So now that just about everything is into the kernel it works good.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I didn't have the nVidia card at the time, so yeah, that doesn't work. &nbsp;Are you sure I'm going to have to rebuild the kernel all over again just to install this thing? &nbsp;I have to admit it wasn't exactly a pleasant experience before and I'm not looking forward to doing it again.<br /><br />Is there any other reason why the kernel would not allow modules to be inserted into it?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Again, depends on the error. From a terminal, type (as root)<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"><br />modprobe nvidia<br /></div><br />If you get an error saying something like incorrect module format, you likely need the patch I mentioned before. If you get an error during the compile of the kernel driver, then you have to compile at least one thing in you kernel as a module. In either case, yes, this means a kernel compile.<br /><br />If you can, post detailed error information here, and we may find a way around the compile.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay, it's got to be the lack of modules 'cause the modprobe came up with &quot;FATAL: module nVidia not found.&quot;<br /><br />Oh well, back to recompiling. &nbsp;Well, on the bright side I get to refresh my memory I suppose.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Remember, you only have to compile *one* feature as a module to get the dynamic module loading stuff working, so pick something that worked before as a module (if anything). ALSA's good because it runs via a startup script that should take care of auto-loading the correct modules.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I just finished recompiling/testing the kernel with multiple things as modules (can't remember what, but a decent amount of things) and the kernel seems to be working the same as the previous one. &nbsp;I still have my network access, the soundcard still works, and overall it seems as if I've been successful in making a kernel that functions identically with lots of modules. &nbsp;Yipee.<br /><br /><br /><br />Now for the letdown. &nbsp;The nVidia driver STILL won't install. &nbsp;Same problem, can't insert the nvidia.ko into the kernel, possibly because it's using the wrong source. &nbsp;Fun, huh? &nbsp;Well, I'm going to tinker with it some more but it's a bit depressing and I don't think I know enough about how the driver works to get it installed manually (ie. without the help of the installer).<br /><br /><br /><br />Anything I can put up that might make it easier to understand where it's screwing up or what's going on with the system?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The source, as far as I can tell, is EXACTLY what was used. &nbsp;However, this time I decided to build the kernel as a normal user so I extracted the source again to a different directory, but to my knowledge the contents of /usr/src/linux-2.6.4 and /home/foxx/src/linux-2.6.4 are exactly the same. &nbsp;I also redid the /usr/src/linux link to point to /usr/src/linux-2.6.4.<br /><br />The installer says it can't find the nVidia module, checks the FTP and says it can't find one for the kernel, and then decides to build one for the kernel. &nbsp;All of this is run as root, not a normal user. &nbsp;It gets to 100% on the build, waits a moment, then comes back with an error message about:<br /><br />&quot;ERROR: &nbsp;Unable to load the kernel module 'nvidia.ko'. &nbsp;This is most likely because the kernel module was built using the wrong kernel source files. &nbsp;Please make sure you have installed the kernel source files for your kernel; on Red Hat Linux systems, for example, be sure you have the 'kernel-source' rpm installed. &nbsp;If you know the correct kernel source files are installed, you may specify the kernel source path with the '--kernel-source-path' commandline option.&quot;<br /><br />Output from modprobe nvidia: &nbsp;FATAL: &nbsp;MOdule nvidia not found.<br /><br /><br />Now, I've taken a look at the /var/log/nvidia-fail.log or whatever it's called. &nbsp;Everything seems to go fine, even when I specify the new source directory used in /home/foxx/src/linux-2.6.4 UNTIL it's done compiling the kernel. &nbsp;The log says that &quot;Kernel module compilation complete&quot; and then it puts in the error message I put up.<br /><br />Immediately after that the line has, &quot;-&gt; Kernel module load error: &nbsp;insmod: &nbsp;error inserting './usr/src/nv/nvidia.ko': -1 No Such Device&quot;<br /><br /><br />Hope this helps. &nbsp;I was thinking that after installing the driver getting the system to use the new card shouldn't be too hard but it seems getting the driver installed in the first place is nothing but a royal bish.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you go 2.6.6, definately downgrade to the earlier NVidia drivers. I seem to recall that 2.6.6 has 4k stack hard wired and the NVidia drivers are notorious stack abusers. As for modutils, I'm unsure of how to check, but its a package you should have installed in addition to the 2.6.x kernel sources (don't know if slack takes care of this for you or not). Its safe to install this, even if you go back to an older kernel, as the new insmod/modprobe/etc programs should be backwards compatable with older modules.<br /><br />As for lsmod not showing any modules loaded, do you have them configured to auto-load?</div>

Barring that, you can get them from kernel.org and build from source (they should have detailed instructions on how to do that as well).<br /><br />As for loading modules automagically at startup, the following is from the <i>Gentoo Handbook (http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml)</i>, but should work the same on Slack:<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: Gentoo handbook</div><div class="quote"><br />Configuring the Modules<br /><br />You should list the modules you want automatically loaded in /etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.4 (or kernel-2.6). You can add extra options to the modules too if you want. <br /><br />To view all available modules, run the following find command. Don't forget to substitute &quot;&lt;kernel version&gt;&quot; with the version of the kernel you just compiled: <br /><br />Code Listing 21: Viewing all available modules<br />&nbsp;<br /># find /lib/modules/&lt;kernel version&gt;/ -type f -iname '*.o' -or -iname '*.ko'<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />For instance, to automatically load the 3c59x.o module, edit the kernel-2.4 or kernel-2.6 file and enter the module name in it. <br /><br />Code Listing 22: Editing /etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.4<br />&nbsp;<br />(Example for 2.4 kernels)<br /># nano -w /etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.4<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Code Listing 23: /etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.4 or kernel-2.6<br />&nbsp;<br />3c59x<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Now run modules-update to commit your changes to the /etc/modules.conf file: <br /></div><br /><br />Finally, as far as I can tell, these problems you are having don't stem from the hardware so much as it does from the new kernel and non-open drivers (NVidia's license for the drivers is incompatable with the GPL - there's source code for the drivers in the download, though), so they aren't supported by the kernel developers. Its up to NVidia to make sure their drivers are compatable with the kernel. For the most part they've done a good job, but 2.6 development is hard to keep pace with these days, and there have been major changes from the 2.4 series. If its any consolation, it took me a week or so to get my nvidia card working and our mutual experience is not uncommon. These problems will go away as development of the 2.6 branch settles down.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hmm, this is very distressing. &nbsp;I make my kernels in almost the exact same way except I call the linux kernel just bzImage-2.6.6 in /boot and that seems to work okay. &nbsp;I also have tried copying the System.map files with the same naming scheme and pointing the System.map link therein to the newest one available (though I have no idea what it's doing).<br /><br /><br /><br />Is there anything I have to do to make sure that modules are loading on bootup? &nbsp;Maybe a RAMdisk image or something? &nbsp;I definitely have the modules installed (though I guess I can do it again, right?) but I can't tell if they're loaded.<br /><br /><br />I was pretty certain this config works for all my hardware. &nbsp;At least, as much as I can tell. &nbsp;The ethernet card, the built-in video (surprisingly difficult), the Live card, the keyboard, mouse, and monitor, all are working flawlessly (well, the sound has an issue in KDE but it doesn't seem to affect playback...I don't know what's causing it but something about CPU overload that doesn't seem to affect anything).<br /><br />EDIT: &nbsp;okay, I think I know for certain that the modules are NOT getting loaded. &nbsp;Just for a laugh I did: &nbsp;&quot;modprobe --verbose smbfs&quot; and it told me it added it into the kernel. &nbsp;I then ran it again and it said, &quot;FATAL: &nbsp;smbfs already in kernel.&quot; So now I need to go back and figure out putting it in so that it autoloads all the modules. &nbsp;If it works I'll post again about it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Fascinating. &nbsp;After some more digging on the 'net I discovered that Slackware loads modules at boot time via /etc/rc.d/rc.modules rather than anything else. &nbsp;<br /><br />I've discovered it has a line called &quot;/sbin/modprobe agpgart&quot; in there which explains why it's not able to load the module (since it's probably not there, it might be built into the kernel itself). &nbsp;In the words of Alice, &quot;Curioser and curioser.&quot;<br /><br />I also found that the other module it was dying on was ide-scsi. &nbsp;Naturally, this is in the rc.modules uncommented and it's not a module (since my ATAPI drive already has a driver, and I don't have anything SCSI related).<br /><br />Well, going to see if this works.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">yea the ide-scsi was the scsi emulation for 2.4 kernel, but 2.6 did away with scsi emulation and has full on atapi support which is nice, especially now when you burn a cd at wide open it don't throw a huge load on your processor<br /><br />i mainly did away with modules, everything i need is compiled into kernel and have nothing more than what i need at this point in time since i upgrade my kernel on every new release, no point in compiling anything extra that i dont need now or wont need in the next few weeks</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It seems that the modules were autoloaded once I removed the commenting on the ones I wished in the rc.modules. &nbsp;Slackware does not have the file specified in the Gentoo description and it seems Slackware's rc.modules does the job just fine on boot-up. &nbsp;Well, whatever works, right?<br /><br /><br /><br />I can see that it has made the correct directory for the module (/usr/src/2.6.6/drivers/video or something like that) but the directory is empty. &nbsp;I'm assuming this is because it did not copy the module to the disk.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, since I'm having so much trouble with getting it to insert it into the kernel, is it possible to have it build the module, put it in the directory myself, and then run modprobe nvidia and have this work? &nbsp;Or is this going to be more invasive than that? &nbsp;I'm guessing it is, but this is driving me up the wall 'cause now it's with the latest kernel (after three rebuilds cumulatively), the kernel is autoloading the modules I built for it, the system seems to be running stable, I've done what the installer has asked me to, and it still refuses to install.<br /><br />I'll check out that minion.de website here in just a little bit. &nbsp;Currently having a problem with Mandrake which I will post about in the Mandrake forum.</div>

I would just check through all the notes and make sure u aren't running into an already fixed problem....or nothing else upgrade using swaret to slackware -current and see if you have any luck....i've always kept my slackware install in the -current version so i dunno if it might be a problem with the new 2.6 kernel+new nvidia drivers in slackware 9.1 or what....but i know slack 9.1 IS 2.6 kernel ready</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sadly I guess I couldn't bring the box to the meeting, I hope you all were okay over there in Pensacola. &nbsp;We were evacuated from the base here (went up to Cordelle instead of Warner-Robins) but when we came back other than not having power for a few days in our little section of the base everything here was perfect (minus some sad trees coming down).<br /><br /><br />Well, with that, when's the NEXT meeting? &nbsp;Same place/same time or will this one be held earlier? :lol:</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I will let someone else post officially, but here is what I know now.<br /><br />Don't know about meeting date, but the location will probably be different. SSI sustained some pretty heavy damage. But you book lovers can take heart. The club library was rescued safe and sound.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That's good to hear...book destruction sucks. &nbsp;It's human nature to resist entropy and books are a method of bringing order to the chaos of time.</div>
