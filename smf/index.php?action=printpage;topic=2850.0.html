					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It seems that the support, and clients, for the Linux and Mac versions of the America&#039;s Army client will no longer be produced.&nbsp; It&#039;s a sad day for the AA Linux players everywhere.<br /><br /><br />http://icculus.org/cgi-bin/finger/finger.pl?user=icculus<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote"><br />Yeah, so a lot of people are emailing me about this news (http://forum.americasarmy.com/viewtopic.php?t=213321).<br /><br />It&#039;s actually true.<br /><br />The Army used to pay me for the Linux and Mac OS X server and clients. I was<br />&nbsp;brought on originally to do just the Linux server, because at the time one of<br />&nbsp;the ArmyGame project&#039;s new game hosting facilities insisted on having a Linux<br />&nbsp;server and recommended me...also, you can make a strong argument that having<br />&nbsp;a Linux server available to the public adds longevity to a title and<br />&nbsp;increases play options for the user looking for an online game to join, both<br />&nbsp;of which are more important to America&#039;s Army than the average multiplayer<br />&nbsp;FPS.<br /><br />Within a few months, the Army (and SCI, in one case) added some more bullet<br />&nbsp;points to my resume: soon, a Linux client was shipping to the public, a<br />&nbsp;64-bit Linux version was demo&#039;d at the Athlon64 launch event, and a Mac OS X<br />&nbsp;client was running on some shiny Apple Cinema Displays in the Army&#039;s<br />&nbsp;floorspace at E3.<br /><br />Literally years have passed since that heyday. I&#039;m now paid for just the Linux<br />&nbsp;server. The Mac and Linux clients were cancelled several versions ago.<br />&nbsp;Let&#039;s say it happened when GameSpy jacked their prices, but the port wasn&#039;t<br />&nbsp;actually cancelled because of the GameSpy fiasco; while it definitely didn&#039;t<br />&nbsp;help, the two events just happened to coincide. I asked that I be permitted<br />&nbsp;to keep shipping the Mac and Linux versions if I wanted to, and was allowed,<br />&nbsp;so long as I understood that it was going to be pro bono work.<br /><br />I&#039;m never one to shrink from a challenge. I ripped out the GameSpy code, built<br />&nbsp;my own Master Server out of car tires and chicken wire, and shipped another<br />&nbsp;Mac build. The Linux client kept chugging along, too. I like to keep at least<br />&nbsp;one free project going at any time, because sometimes the project is more<br />&nbsp;important than the paycheck. At one point it was Postal 2, or Serious Sam,<br />&nbsp;or Lugaru, but at this moment it sort of became ArmyOps out of necessity,<br />&nbsp;since I didn&#039;t want this game to dry up.<br /><br />The problem, though, is that I&#039;m a busy, busy guy. There are paying clients<br />&nbsp;that are waiting for me to give them my attention, and my TODO list is<br />&nbsp;continuing to grow. There are clients I work for, too many pro bono ports<br />&nbsp;that I think are important, personal projects and experiments, open source<br />&nbsp;stuff that needs love and care...I really do try to make everyone happy, and<br />&nbsp;spend almost every waking hour in a debugger to do so, but as all the people<br />&nbsp;still emailing me for UTPG updates can tell you, sometimes things just get<br />&nbsp;flat out dropped. There are only so many hours in the day, even when I use<br />&nbsp;each at maximum efficiency.<br /><br />Sadly, the ArmyGame project is about to teeter into this category.<br /><br />2.7 is coming soon, and I&#039;m still fighting with the 2.6 clients. Future<br />&nbsp;versions of the game will be adding more middleware that I can&#039;t keep up with<br />&nbsp;and for which no one will be footing the bill. The Army, I think, probably<br />&nbsp;sees these freebie ports as a nuisance, since they&#039;re almost always late,<br />&nbsp;and all they see are complaints from the Mac and Linux users about delays in<br />&nbsp;a project they thought they axed several releases ago.<br /><br />To be clear, there aren&#039;t plans to abandon the Linux server at this point,<br />&nbsp;but at this time, the non-Windows clients are basically gone.<br /><br />What you can do: nothing. Please don&#039;t email anyone about this, don&#039;t offer to<br />&nbsp;send money. It&#039;s just how this goes for now. The client may resurface at some<br />&nbsp;point, but don&#039;t hold your breath at this time. 2.6 might still make it out<br />&nbsp;the door, 2.7 probably won&#039;t.<br /><br />Apple&#039;s Boot Camp had nothing to do with this, either, as some forum people<br />&nbsp;have apparently decided. That being said, lucky you if you have an Intel Mac:<br />&nbsp;you can boot to Windows to keep playing. Linux users can try their luck with<br />&nbsp;Wine, Cedega, or Windows itself.<br /><br />It&#039;s been a good run, and I thank everyone for their support and passion that<br />&nbsp;made this such a great game for the without-Windows crowd.<br /><br />--ryan</div></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, that sucks, but I can honestly say I&#039;m not suprised.<br /><br />Linux has a *long* way to go market share wise before it becomes a marketible gaming platform.&nbsp; Most of the handfull of linux games we have now are either gifts from benevolent Engine developers (who make their profits elsewhere), or ported abandonware.&nbsp; Basically, for the serious gamer, the only two viable options are dual booting, or moving to a console of your choice.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been dual booting for a while now, but the way my summer and fall are shaping up, I doubt I&#039;ll have much time for games anyway.</div>

Granted, not that many, but still. I think the problem is that a lot of games use DirectX rather than OpenGL which is portable to multiple operating systems.<br /><br />I think we are going to start seeing more games come our way. Considering Id&#039;s Doom 3 engine is so awesome and runs on Linux and with the new Unreal engine coming out, we should see some titles from the folks who license the engines. If nothing else, we have Enemy Territory: Quake Wars coming sometime soon (Wikipedia says so (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enemy_Territory:_Quake_Wars)).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi, was checking out the forums and catching up a bit.  The new forums look fantastic BTW.<br /><br />As quite a few of you know, I converted to Mac almost 3 years ago.  I suspect that market share percentage is about the same, but the markets are different.  You just have to look back at Loki&#039;s mishandling to understand the differences.  In several of the pundit&#039;s takes on Loki&#039;s failings, the Linux community was too cheap to buy them was prevalent.  I always thought that was bull because I bought just about every Loki game that came out -- more games for Linux than for my Mac.  What I remember back then is how it was painful to get it running sometimes.  I still see that to some extent.  I am almost exclusively a Linux server person now and even now couldn&#039;t recommend Linux to most of my friends.<br /><br />When I recommended Linux to a local school I am helping, there was a lot of blinking.  On the server side, they were luke warm -- on the client side, frosty.  Frosty because of ignorance of projects like LTSP or the fact they could simply not spend money, no.  Six months later, still no Linux in house, even after offering to take care of the server&#039;s patches and emergencies for next to nothing.<br /><br />I understand a lot has changed in many distros to make them easier one way or the other, but as gaming platforms for this gamer, there is still a lot to be desired.  Heck, I even got tired of putting money in my Windows or Mac machines in favor of a XBox360.  It&#039;s easier.  (Just like PS 3 or Wii will be easier.)  Put the DVD in.  Wait a few seconds.  Play. Save game.  Turn off.  Heck it was easier to surround sound with this console than it was to do so with my PC.  And if you haven&#039;t played Halo or Oblivion on an XBox, you don&#039;t know what you are missing. :)<br /><br />The point...right I have one.  I don&#039;t think you are going to see more games coming your way until it just works no matter what, no matter what distro you are using, packaged up the same for all distros.  And note that the games that you quote are simply rehashes of existing technology from the same old companies.  I for one am not looking a gift horse in the mouth -- the community should be grated for id&#039;s and Epic&#039;s engines and their dedication to running clients on Linux.<br /><br />That said, are there any initiatives to get the myriad of distro&#039;s to finally unify libraries related to game developement in lockstep or provide a package management interface wrapper for developers that isn&#039;t to painful to learn?<br /><br />Scott<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The major issue I have with consoles is that first person shooters just aren&#039;t the same. The controls suck when compared to a keyboard and mouse. <br /><br />With the rising costs of consoles, which aren&#039;t good for more than playing games, the return on investment just doesn&#039;t add up. You can get an Xbox360 for the same price you can a good video card. The thing is, when you put that video card into a computer, you can do a lot of other things with that computer. With the speculated price of the PS3 coming in at over $500, I can&#039;t see spending that much on a gaming platform.<br /><br />The price on console games are also going up. Xbox360 games are priced at $60 and you can bet that Sony and Nintendo will follow suit. Your typical first run computer title run between $40 and $50 and those prices come down usually within six months.<br /><br />In case you haven&#039;t seen the state of gaming under Linux recently (past year or so), most games out there have installers that more or less just work. Any modern distro supplies the proper libraries especially since the industry has settled on opengl. If you&#039;re using one of the main distros (Fedora or Redhat derivative, Mandriva, Debian, SUSE, Gentoo, Slackware) and have X installed, you should be good to go. YMMV, but any issues are generally well documented with workarounds available via simple Google search. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I used to own folks with just the keyboard back in the day before my hair turned gray.&nbsp; I think Lloyd was watching the first generation of Power Rangers and hacking folks&#039; BBS&#039;s for fun &amp; profit.&nbsp; Then I forced myself to learn to use the mouse and keyboard.&nbsp; Now I have forced myself to learn to use the controller.<br /><br />Let me preface that I am not trying to sell anyone on the console vs. PC gaming debate.&nbsp; It is simply that I am willing to pay that price.<br /><br />I also believe that triple A titles on PC will eventually follow suit as well.&nbsp; I remember Best Buy having Doom 3 for $54.99 or $59.99 the first week or so it was out.&nbsp; I paid it.&nbsp; Although with gamerankings.com, I am able to really research a title and decide if it is a real triple A title and worth my bucks and time.&nbsp; I bet I spend less due to that (and also because I am a Dad).&nbsp; Again, my gaming needs are different from yours.<br /><br />I think the argument I am making is that a great river of titles is not imminent. :)&nbsp; It will be a trickle with the same old developers putting out the same upgraded titles: Quake, ET, UT, Savage.&nbsp; This obviously meets your needs, but I hope it doesn&#039;t satisfy them.&nbsp; I hope the community either asks for native ports or at least let&#039;s the company know they are playing under Cedega.<br /><br />Note that I am currently addicted to Oblivion on 360, Guild Wars on Windows, Wesnoth on Mac, UT2K4 on Linux/Windows/Mac, but was a Linux user playing Warcraft on Cedega for a while.<br /><br />So what games besides the new version of ET, Savage or UT are coming out?&nbsp; I would love to read where it is going.&nbsp; I all but stopped playing anything on Linux other than what boots up on Knoppix years ago and I have friends that would love alternatives to Windows on PC&#039;s.<br /><br />Scott</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ah, but the first person shooters for the most part *are* the same.&nbsp; I used to agree with the &#039;consoles have fundimentally bad controls&#039; camp, since I myself am slightly more precise with mouse and keyboard, but I&#039;ve watched some&nbsp; experienced console players, and I&#039;ve seen people consistantly land shots that I can&#039;t do with a mouse and keyboard.&nbsp; I think this argument stems from the first time you play someone *really* good on console multiplayer, they stomp you, where you&#039;re used to winning on the pc, and you&#039;re like &#039;man controlers suck&#039;.&nbsp; IMO, controlers are *the* interface for any game that&#039;s not a fps or strategy game.&nbsp; (Though, i will admit, i hate the PS2&#039;s controler, it hurts my hands)<br /><br />I take extreme argument with the line that &#039;consoles are just for games&#039;.&nbsp; That line hasn&#039;t sold since PS1.&nbsp; You can run linux, or the xbox media center on the xbox.&nbsp; You can run linux on the ps2 if you opted for the hard drive.&nbsp; Even the revolution can become a node in a LTSP setup.&nbsp; Both systems can play DVD&#039;s and music.&nbsp; Heck, the 360 and PS3 are considered living room media hubs.&nbsp; That&#039;s an aweful lot of functionality you get for 4-500 bucks (for the next gen systems).<br /><br />I think consoles provide considerible bang for the buck, compared to the $1500 (aprox) you&#039;d have to spend on a new gaming rig that could run the latest and greatest PC games at the highest quality.&nbsp; <br /><br />All this talk of gaming is soon to be pointless anyway.&nbsp; I have a job, I have summer classes.&nbsp; I *want* to start working out at the gym again.&nbsp; I can&#039;t see myself investing 400 bucks in a 360 given how little free time I&#039;ll have to play it, much less 1500 on a new PC.&nbsp; If I had known how little free time I would have in college, I would have built me a low end *work* machine for about 3-4 hundred bucks back in &#039;02.&nbsp; As it is now, I have an aging *gaming* machine, that isn&#039;t strong enough to play the latest games, but is very expensive for a *work* machine.<br /><br />Edit:<br />I just read that the price of a PS3 is gona be $5-600 as apposed to 3-400 for the xbox 360.&nbsp; I should be clear, while I support the 360 and Wii (god help us), I do not think the ps3 is a reasonible value considering the massive investment you have to make for a fully functional system.</div>
