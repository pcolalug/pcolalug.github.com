					Post by: <b>dpeach</b> on <b>January 11, 2009, 11:20:25 pm</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">We are going to be sharing Linux/OSS resources at the meeting on Thursday January 15. I will be bringing my list of websites that I visit as well as other related sources for OSS/Linux news. Also, if there are places you regularly find yourself visiting to get help, please be ready to share. You don&#039;t need to prepare a 20 minute presentation, but we do want to try and compile a list that we can post to the forums. (Secretary, shave your legs and get your pencil ready).<br /><br />I know we have probably discussed most of the places you will mention in various topics previously. This will be a good time to update any former topic and pool all our current resources into one place.<br /><br />Look forward to seeing you Thursday January 15.<br /><br />If you are not able to make the meeting, but want to include your favorite resources, leave a reply to this post with the URL and why it is a useful site.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">We had a great meeting. A large list of resources were compiled which our secretary is working to put up in its own thread here on the forums. If you have any resources to add then feel free to jump in on that thread and add a link and why it is useful.<br /><br />We talked about the Northwest Florida Association of Computer User Groups Expo (http://www.nwfacug.org/Expo/Expo.htm) coming up next weekend that was mentioned this week on the forum (http://www.pcolalug.org/smf/index.php?topic=3454.0). I am out of town on Saturday, but would love it if someone could go to the meeting. It is free of charge and we could probably get out some flyers about the Pcola LUG. Can anyone commit to go? No one at the meeting last night was able to make a commitment, but maybe someone in the forums is planning to attend. If so, please post here and we will work on getting flyers to you that you can hand out. We can either print something and get them to you or get a file to you that you can print.<br /><br />On that note, does anyone have any flyers made up? We have had various flyers through the years that we have used for different projects. If you have a copy of one of these (or know where one is stored on-line) please make that available to us for this, and future, projects.<br /><br />Was there anything else we discussed at the meeting that you think needs to be added to the meeting notes? Please add them to this thread.<br /><br />Thanks for being there last night.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Brett brought to our attention a handy tool for managing multiple machines via SSH: ClusterSSH (http://sourceforge.net/projects/clusterssh/).&nbsp; He also touched on the latest VMWare Server 2&#039;s web management features, giving us a very short preview.&nbsp; Also: my legs are itching today... hmmmmmm!</div>
