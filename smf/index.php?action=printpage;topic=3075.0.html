					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have a question about setting up a home network. Strictly computer to computer without an internet connection. How would I go about doing some thing like that? Is there a dummies book or some sort of reading material out there?<br /><br />I&#039;m using Ubuntu and DSL</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you want to network two computers directly together with <b>no internet access</b>, and each one only has one ethernet interface, you can buy, or crimp your own crossover ethernet cable.&nbsp; Plug each end into the two computers, set up the IPs and such on the computer, and you&#039;ll have a fully functional network between the two PCs.&nbsp; It is somewhat limiting though.<br /><br />If you want one computer to have internet, and wish to share that with the other, or not share it, the computer you want internet on will need two interfaces, if you use the method I described above.<br /><br />Otherwise, the easiest thing you can do is go out, and get a cheap home router, and plug both computers into it.&nbsp; You&#039;ll be able to get the internet on both PCs, and they will both see each other.<br /><br />Ian</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Also if you get a router and don&#039;t need or want Internet access on the computers, but still want them connected to one another, this will still work. Not fool proof, but simple.<br /><br />As was suggested, the crossover cable is a really cheap alternative. You just need it and a network card in each computer. Then you have to manually assign an IP address to each computer. There are plenty of how-to&#039;s out there to help you with that.<br /><br />Router is easier and gives you more options down the road though.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">An addendum to the crossover cable bit: if both of your computers have Gigabit ethernet you don&#039;t need a crossover cable.</div>
