Now, with other Linux distros (SuSE, Sun, et al) spending lots of time on &quot;enterprise desktop&quot; solutions could this be a marketing ploy? Not a critisizm, really, just wondering if we're going to see more traditionally closed-source marketing tactics coming from commercial Linux vendors. IMHO, this is a bit dangerous, since the risk of alienating the community that builds/supports your product line is pretty high. Though, I'm curious to know just how many of the &quot;hardcore&quot;, active kernel developers actually work for one of the big companies. I know IBM, RedHat, SuSE, and Oracle employ a lot of Linux hackers. Seems that as commercial competition heats up between folks with large investments in Linux development/deployment, these folks could find themselves in un-enviable positions. These are just idle wanderings, though. May really be nothing to it at all.</div>

Now, with other Linux distros (SuSE, Sun, et al) spending lots of time on &quot;enterprise desktop&quot; solutions could this be a marketing ploy? </div><br /><br />Actually, according to the article, he still recommends Linux for the Enterprise Desktop. His remarks were specifically pointed to the &quot;Home User&quot;. If you think about it, he is right. Working at Best Buy, I get an idea of the computer knowledge that average buyers have. &nbsp;Since you don't have an &quot;IT support staff&quot; at home, who's going to support the home desktop?<br /><br />Let's put it this way, if Best Buy or other local major retailer was to start selling Linux Desktop computers, which one of you in this forum would give your home number out to all of the customers who buy one to give them support?<br /><br />Compared side by side, Windows is much more mature and easier to maintain than Linux. This doesn't mean it's more secure or stable, just easier. Home users don't care about security. (You don't know how many first time buyers at Best Buy have turned down Virus protection software and firewalls.) Home users don't care about stability, as Windows is stable out of the box, it's just when you install software that you start having problems. Then you can blame it on the third party software for crashing your whole system.<br /><br />Windows also has more compatibility built in than Linux. Pick up the latest gadget and see which drivers come with it, Windows or Linux? <br /><br />So, for the average home user, Windows is currently the way to go.<br /><br />On the other hand, Corporate America can use Linux. &nbsp;You have IT support shops in the companies. Your not getting the latest &quot;Toys&quot; from Best Buy or Walmart to add on to your system. You&#8217;re not installing the latest games. Businesses are performing tried and true functions like Accounting, Word Processing, etc. Linux shines here.<br /><br />So, back to the article. Again, he said the Home market should stick with Windows, &quot;For right now&quot;. I agree.<br /><br />Steve</div>

Working at Best Buy, I get an idea of the computer knowledge that average buyers have. &nbsp;Since you don't have an &quot;IT support staff&quot; at home, who's going to support the home desktop?<br /><br />Let's put it this way, if Best Buy or other local major retailer was to start selling Linux Desktop computers, which one of you in this forum would give your home number out to all of the customers who buy one to give them support?</div><br />steve, no offense, but this is utter hogwash. Who supports the home user now? Though I don't have the amount of exposure to the general computing public that you do, I do know quite a few folks that don't really understand the PC in my life. The fact of the matter is that PC's and PC OS's are complicated. Period. No matter who provides the OS. Sure, Windows and Mac have more wizards and dialogs and makes *many* more decisions on your behalf (and without telling you what they are, why they were made, nor what you can do to change it if you want), but most of the &quot;home&quot; computer users I know are just as clueless when it comes to making their MS box do what they want, or why its not doing what they think it should, or (more often) why its doing something they think it shouldn't. These folks call *me* to find out. Not BestBuy, not MS, not HP/Dell/Whatever. So, should I have them call BestBuy? What support number does BestBuy currently give folks who buy WinXP (or any other retailer; I'm not trying to bash steve or BestBuy here <img src="Smileys/default/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />)?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: steve</div><div class="quote">Compared side by side, Windows is much more mature and easier to maintain than Linux.</div><br />If by mature, you mean the code's been around longer, I dunno. WinNT (the code-base of WinXP) has been around about as long, I think. As for maintainability of a *home desktop*, I think they're about on par, with Linux getting a bit of an edge, all distros considered. We've got auto-updates for the big-name boxed distros (and most of the smaller DIY distros), plus you don't have to defrag every week, update virus definition files, then wipe the hardrive and re-install every six months because NTFS gave up managing disk space in a sane manner (that last may have been fixed. My Win2000 experiences have let me go as much as a year-and-a-half without having to re-install). &nbsp;Not that many home users I know &quot;maintain&quot; their systems at all...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: steve</div><div class="quote">This doesn't mean it's more secure or stable, just easier. Home users don't care about security. (You don't know how many first time buyers at Best Buy have turned down Virus protection software and firewalls.) Home users don't care about stability, as Windows is stable out of the box, it's just when you install software that you start having problems. Then you can blame it on the third party software for crashing your whole system.</div><br />Well, they wouldn't have much use for virus protection at all if they were running SuSE Desktop, would they? Besides, do you also explane to them how to install the software and set it up to automatically update their definition files every hour? Linux is stable out of the box. Before and after software installs. Without re-boot. No one to blame at all.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: steve</div><div class="quote">Windows also has more compatibility built in than Linux. Pick up the latest gadget and see which drivers come with it, Windows or Linux?</div><br />Hardware compatability for gadgets, sure. In my experience, though, most consumer-level stuff can work under Linux too. The kicker, and anyone with a Zaurus will back me on this, is that the software to support the gadgets won't run on Linux. This sux to be sure. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: steve</div><div class="quote">So, for the average home user, Windows is currently the way to go.</div><br />Based on your arguments so far, I'd actually think OSX was a better choice. Ease of use? Plug-n-Play? Stable? Secure? All that 'n a bag of chips. And those consumer gadgets, *much* sexier...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: steve</div><div class="quote">On the other hand, Corporate America can use Linux.</div><br />I wish my organization would buy off on that... <img src="Smileys/default/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: steve</div><div class="quote">You have IT support shops in the companies.

							<div class="post"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: rburt3</div><div class="quote">steve, no offense, but this is utter hogwash. Who supports the home user now? </div><br /><br />Let's see:<br /><br />Best Buy - Bring your system in to the service counter for support.<br />Any local Computer store.<br /><br />In fact, try something, call all of the local computer sales/service stores (Including Tech Advanced, Circuit City, etc) and ask if they can fix a Windows problem for you. Then ask if they can fix a Linux problem for you. <br />Pretend you're Joe average home person and ask your freinds and co-workers if they can help with a problem you're having in Windows, then ask if they can help with a problem you're having in Linux. Unless you work in a Linux environment, you're going to find more support for Windows than Linux.<br /><br />When you ask &quot;Who supports the home user now&quot;, you are still in that enterprise mind set. You're looking for some company, etc. But you have to remember where the home user gets most of their daily support, it's from their peers. And Joe peer is more likely to support Windows than Linux. How do most people get initial support for Car problems, house problems, etc? By asking friends and co-workers. Anyway, I'm straying from the topic.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: rburt3</div><div class="quote">What support number does BestBuy currently give folks who buy WinXP?</div><br /><br />Have them call their local Best Buy. We'd be happy to have them bring it in and we'll take a look at it, for a fee. However, if it's a Linux computer, there's not much we can do. In that case call the local Linux computer service shop. (Who is that again?) I know there are a lot of places in town you can take your computer to for service, how many of them support Linux?<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: rburt3</div><div class="quote"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: steve</div><div class="quote">Compared side by side, Windows is much more mature and easier to maintain than Linux.</div><br />If by mature, you mean the code's been around longer, I dunno. WinNT (the code-base of WinXP) has been around about as long, I think. </div><br />Actually, the user interface of WINNT was based on Windows 3.1 which was based on Windows 3.0. which was released in 1990. Linux running the X desktop came out closer to 1996/97. But age has nothing to do with what I'm talking about. The mature aspect I refer to is the &quot;Desktop OS&quot; The linux Desktop is IMHO still cumbersome to work with. Just try to customize it, install software from it, configure software from it, etc. Windows has a very mature set of APIs that devellopers tie into in order to make ALL apps in Windows, look and feel the same. These include older apps as well as newer apps. Try installing a two year old Linux application on the latest Mandrake, Red Hat, SusE desktop. Chances are it won't work. It will in Windows and you never have to leave the desktop. Linux still hasn't developped an autorun for CDs yet.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: rburt3</div><div class="quote">As for maintainability of a *home desktop*, I think they're about on par, with Linux getting a bit of an edge, all distros considered.

My Win2000 experiences have let me go as much as a year-and-a-half without having to re-install). &nbsp;Not that many home users I know &quot;maintain&quot; their systems at all...</div><br /><br />Ahh, but home users install and remove different apps from their systems. Where's the uninstall for a Linux application that wasn't installed by an RPM. In fact, unless the Distro maintainer or some third part programmer likes an App, chances are you won't find an RPM for it. Most Applications I've found, the developpers only provide the Source. Other people have to create the RPMs for the different distros. You don't have this problem with Windows. Home users also use things like Drag and Drop between apps, which Linux is still working on. The same goes for Cut and Paste between apps. These are things home users expect to work.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: rburt3</div><div class="quote">Well, they wouldn't have much use for virus protection at all if they were running SuSE Desktop, would they?</div><br /><br />Umm, yes they would. Don't get caught up in the media hipe. There are Linux viruses out there and you don't have to be running as root for them to hurt you. Not only that, the main reason there are more viruses targeting windows is because there are more Windows users out there. If everyone were using Linux then the viruses would be attacking Linux computers. And just how many &quot;Home users&quot; would run as root just to make things easier. I know Linux geeks that run as root. There are also Linux Virus scanner sout there. Oh, and back in 1986 there were more viruses/worms targetting Unix and Apple than there were targetting the PC/MS-DOS computers. <br />(Question: What's to keep someone from infecting an RPM with a worm/virus? You have to be root to install most RPMs and without a virus scanner on Linux, you're suseptable)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: rburt3</div><div class="quote">Linux is stable out of the box.

You convinced youreself. The problem with having this discussion is that I use Windows XP and Windows 2000 at work and I use Linux at home and soem Linux Servers at work. You already said you weren't familiar with Windows 2000 so you can only relate to Older Windows and the latest Linux. To make a fair comparison, you should extensivly use the latest Linux as well as the latest Windows.<br /><br />Steve</div>

							<div class="post">If I had to choose a different OS other than a Linux distro I would recommend Mac OSX for someone who is about to purchase a new computer. There are so many companies from computer manufactures to printing companies and everything in between who's livelyhood is totally dependent upon Microsoft that it is not possible for them to be objective about such a subject. Home users can do anything they generally do with a linux distro on a preinstalled installation that they can do on a windows preinstallation computer (actually more because of all the software with linux). People who have invested in windows software would have a harder time with it than new users. I have some software I don't want to give up and why should I. I own a copy of 98se and the software on it still works so I dual boot. I only get on the net using Mandrake linux though. I decided last year to not purchase any computer related item that does not work with linux and have notified catalog companies like pc connection of that to try to encourage them to carry more linux stuff. I am totally satisfied with Mandrake 9.1 even though I preordered 9.2 powerpack. Mandrake is better than windows. Try to run three copies of IE on three sites at the same time on different desktops (Yes I do have a need for that). Mandrake and some other distro's are just plain better. I have never run Red Hat, I couldn't get is to install on my laptop so I might agree that windows is better than Red Hat for home users but not better than Mac OSX and certianly not better than Mandrake. Just my opinion.</div>

							<div class="post">A couple of questions before my two cents...<br /><br />Why is this topic in the Mandrake section and secondly, shouldn't this be moved to &quot;The Great Debate&quot;?<br /><br />I think what's his name from Redhat is half way right, but I lean toward my good brother's final opinion that computers are complicated and that home users having full fledged workhorse computers isn't the best idea.<br /><br />I also agree that MacOS X is the best option for users. I'll be honest, it's darn nice. Things make sense and it caters to the newb and to the power user. I would use it.<br /><br />Now, the bigger question that I had to ask myself recently. Why didn't I buy a Mac and why don't I run Linux on my home desktop or laptop? I like my games and Windows isn't that bad for the stuff I do. I can use it because I know what I'm doing and have enough experience to figure things out, but I work with and know enough people who have troubles with it that I hate supporting it. <br /><br />Do I want to support Linux in a Windows world? Hell no. Do I want to support anything? Double hell no. I have better things to do.<br /><br />My solution...appliances. Make some awesome home use appliances that just get the job done with intuitive designs and little fuss. Of all the companies to do this, I think it would be Apple or some one who worked for them.<br /><br />Oh yeah, I like linux for my server stuff and I may try it on my desktop again soon. The major desktop environments are getting to be bloated and they were running slower than Windows 2000 on my old computer. I used to use Linux on the desktop because it was faster and wasn't so &quot;fluffy&quot;. Yes, this is a demand thing because people want pretty things, but dammit, don't give up speed and stability because of it. <br /><br />Also, now that I'm wanting to get into programming again, I want to do it legally, so I'll use Linux for that as well, but sort of dread going back to it. I may try FreeBSD. Honestly, I have to do more work to get a linux system running in an acceptable manor for a desktop workstation than I do windows, so I wonder if I shouldn't just do what I can from windows. Maybe I'm being swayed by the concepts of &quot;using what works best&quot; and &quot;right tool for the right job&quot; and losing my ideology, but I get tired of using poorly designed programs that sometimes work and usually suck at it when they do. I use computers to get things done most of the time. Yes, it is my hobby, but why do I need to go insanely out of my way when there are easier and better ways of doing the same thing?! So that is why I like linux for the server. Linux in the server world owns completely. Things work and they typically work amazingly well, but good lord do they suck goats on the desktop compared to what else is out there.<br /><br />Complicated things are bad for a stupid public. <br /><br />I hope you have enjoyed this rambling and completely unfocused post. Flame on!</div>

Then ask if they can fix a Linux problem for you.</div><br />Point taken. So, what can we do as a LUG to change this? Our new sponsor sells/supports Linux PC's. How do we guage the pervasiveness of *nix in the area? Is the membership here representative of the computing populace using non-MS computers at home?<br />&nbsp;<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: steve</div><div class="quote">Pretend you're Joe average home person and ask your freinds and co-workers if they can help with a problem you're having in Windows, then ask if they can help with a problem you're having in Linux. Unless you work in a Linux environment, you're going to find more support for Windows than Linux.</div><br /><br />Actually, many of my co-workers can help me in this reguard. As for friends, family, and the like, most of them helped convince me that the pervasiveness of general-purpose computing equipment is a Bad Thing(TM).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: steve</div><div class="quote">When you ask &quot;Who supports the home user now&quot;, you are still in that enterprise mind set. You're looking for some company, etc. But you have to remember where the home user gets most of their daily support, it's from their peers.</div><br />In light of this, then, my experience tells me that they are just as likely to get bogus advice, regardless of the OS. So yes, there are more people out there who can tell you the wrong way to do something in MS products than there are for other OS's, I suppose. Besides, unless those peers providing the support are technology professionals themselves, they probably get their information from the internet, where you can find just as much help, if not more, for Linux than anything else.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: steve</div><div class="quote">Have them call their local Best Buy. We'd be happy to have them bring it in and we'll take a look at it, for a fee.<br /><br />&nbsp;However, if it's a Linux computer, there's not much we can do. In that case call the local Linux computer service shop. (Who is that again?) I know there are a lot of places in town you can take your computer to for service, how many of them support Linux?</div><br /><br />So it boils down to support options, I see. Ok, a valid point. I sometimes forget that not everyone tries to diagnose and fix their own computer problems before seeking outside help (which is a bit silly, since I would never try to fix my own car, washing machine, or other consumer device).<br /><br />Do you guys get alot of &quot;bench work&quot;, BTW? I'm just curious as to how many folks take their PC's to service shops rather than those &quot;peers&quot; we mentioned or some person fixing PC's on the side.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: steve</div><div class="quote">Actually, the user interface of WINNT was based on Windows 3.1 which was based on Windows 3.0. which was released in 1990. Linux running the X desktop came out closer to 1996/97. But age has nothing to do with what I'm talking about. The mature aspect I refer to is the &quot;Desktop OS&quot; The linux Desktop is IMHO still cumbersome to work with. Just try to customize it, install software from it, configure software from it, etc.</div><br />Ok, this is totally counter to my own experience. First you have to purchase/obtain whole other software packages for Windows to achieve the level of customization you get from KDE, Gnome, Enlightenment, et al. I will agree that most Windows applications have a fairly consistent look and feel, as long as they come from Microsoft. But what do you expect, since its the same company providing the OS and the software (and the hardware and the network and the...)? Third-party software is a mixed bag. Just because you use VB or MFC to create your application doesn't mean you can &quot;magically&quot; achieve harmony with the host OS in terms of UI conventions.<br /><br />And again, if maturity and integration of the desktop is the goal, then why isn't Mac the answer?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: steve</div><div class="quote">Windows has a very mature set of APIs that devellopers tie into in order to make ALL apps in Windows, look and feel the same.</div><br />This is only partially true, having written my fair share of windows applications using both MFC/C++ and Visual Basic. The Win32 api is, quite simply, a mess. Besides, widget placement, size, fonts, icons, the whole shebang is still the responsability of the programmer. As mentioned before, it is a fallacy to think that just because an app was written using MS tools that it is, by default, going to present the user with an interface consistent with all other applications on the machine.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: steve</div><div class="quote">These include older apps as well as newer apps. Try installing a two year old Linux application on the latest Mandrake, Red Hat, SusE desktop. Chances are it won't work. It will in Windows and you never have to leave the desktop. Linux still hasn't developped an autorun for CDs yet.</div><br />You are kidding, right? Then why were folks unable to install games they bought only months before on their new WinXP boxes? Microsoft is *the worst* at obsoleting software with OS versions. So, I can install all Win95 software, without updates, patches, or work-arounds on XP? I'd literally have to see it to believe it.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: steve</div><div class="quote">Ahh, but home users install and remove different apps from their systems. Where's the uninstall for a Linux application that wasn't installed by an RPM.</div><br />Mostly, you can just delete the directory where it was installed. How do I manually un-install a Windows program without an un-installer? How do I remove registry entries that were missed if there was an installer? How do I know the d**n thing was even removed in the first place?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: steve</div><div class="quote">In fact, unless the Distro maintainer or some third part programmer likes an App, chances are you won't find an RPM for it. Most Applications I've found, the developpers only provide the Source. Other people have to create the RPMs for the different distros. You don't have this problem with Windows.</div><br />When I ran SuSE or Red Hat, this was never a problem. I got RPM's for everything I wanted from the respective vendor's websites. Perhaps its the distro you are using? And no, you don't have this problem with Windows because you pay (or should, rather) for all of this packaging. Pay for a distro, and you get access to lots more pre-packaged stuff.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: steve</div><div class="quote">Home users also use things like Drag and Drop between apps, which Linux is still working on. The same goes for Cut and Paste between apps. These are things home users expect to work.</div><br />This has only been a problem for me in a few, minor apps. This has always worked, even in Gentoo.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: steve</div><div class="quote">(Question: What's to keep someone from infecting an RPM with a worm/virus? You have to be root to install most RPMs and without a virus scanner on Linux, you're suseptable)</div><br />I agree with all of your points here, but that *is* kind of the point. Buying into Windows all but *requires* you to set up a firewall/virus scanner.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: steve</div><div class="quote">Actually, I've had my X windows lock up on me more than my XP windows.</div><br />Are you running a boxed distro? Did you hand-configure your X? I can make Windows do wonky things too.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: steve</div><div class="quote">Haha, you're funny.<img src="Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" border="0" /> I didn't convice you. You convinced youreself. The problem with having this discussion is that I use Windows XP and Windows 2000 at work and I use Linux at home and soem Linux Servers at work. You already said you weren't familiar with Windows 2000</div><br />Actually, I use Windows2000 every day at work. Linux every day at home. And no, its not funny at all. Computers and Operating Systems are just too complex for the casual user to operate without creating problems having real negative financial and social impact. I'm not saying that mom and pop shouldn't have access to the internet, but that they should rather have a closed-top box for such things and a game console for games, etc. You get the idea. I really do think that a general purpose computer is something that most folks don't need and shouldn't have to hassle with.</div>

							<div class="post">Rburt, I feel like I am being replaced by steve as the person you pick on. <img src="Smileys/default/cry.gif" alt="cry" border="0" /> <br /><br />Actually, steve, you are welcome to take my place.<br /><br />Just having gone through a similar discussion with a person that does not want to spend the rest of his life looking at a black screen with white letters, but yet totally fed up with Windows, I landed on OS X as a recommendation. (I think that is the longest proper sentence I have ever written). It is a great system. <br /><br />As much as I like Linux and as much as it does 90% of everything I need to do, I still have to go with OS X as an out of the box solution for the guy that just wants his computer to work. Would I ever buy a Mac and run OS X? Probably not. In general I don't like Macs. But for ease of use, and the ability to do 100% of a person's needs, OS X is the way to go.<br /><br />May parents will still run Windows for a long time. It took me long enough to train them on how to open a program, I don't want to have to go through that again. I still sometimes get calls on how to install something (you know, double click the setup.exe icon). I certainly do not want to try and talk them through a source install on something with Linux. <br /><br />In other words, I agree that Linux is not quite there for the average user. Windows is not much better, but as steve says, there are places to get help. And I do not buy the thinking, rburt3, that people can get help from the 'net. If a person is having a problem that a co-worker can solve by just giving advice, then the problem was not that serious and the person probably would not know how to find the information that he needed off the net. My parents have been Internet user's for almost 7 years and I still have to remind them to ask Google before asking me.<br /><br />Generally, the average consumer is not going to know where to get information off the net, whether they use Windows or Linux. Though I think 'net information is viable &quot;tech support,&quot; I don't think it is realistic to think the average guy will use it.</div>

							<div class="post">From a new-uses perspective I don't think Windows is any easier to use than Mandrake (feel free to replace Mandrake with your current Boxed Distro of Choice). &nbsp;Either way they're having to learn everything from scratch. &nbsp;It's not much harder to install a program in Linux (which uses a GUI installer or GUI based RPM manager) than a graphical Windows application.<br /><br />Besides installed / removing apps I don't expect end-users to be 'administering' their own system much at all. &nbsp;Some things can be a pain in the but under both systems - Printers come to mind. &nbsp;It used to be the case that printers just worked under Windows. &nbsp;But as soon as you get something newer / exotic everything falls apart <img src="Smileys/default/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> &nbsp;Ever try to install a recent USB Xerox (or HP or Epson) printer / scanner in windows? &nbsp;Forget that it usually doesn't work on the first (or second try), I love the warning labels on the printer, the driver CD, and on-screen when you put in the CD. &nbsp;&quot;DO NOT PLUG UP YOUR PRINTER UNTIL AFTER YOU HAVE INSTALLED THE SOFTWARE!&quot; &nbsp;Well that's kind of odd, isn't windows supposed to be plug and play? &nbsp;I open the pretty box my printer came in, plug in the USB cable, and I can print? &nbsp;Oh well... &nbsp;It was a nice concept <img src="Smileys/default/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /> &nbsp;Maybe this is why I run a 10 year old HP LaserJet 3 that does just work everywhere....<br /><br />As far as Mac / OSX goes. &nbsp;I don't know yet. &nbsp;I'm on the look-out for a good deal (unless I talk myself into buying a new apple notebook). &nbsp;When I get one I'll be sure to share my experiences.<br /><br />On another topic - application development - I guess MS-Windows toolkits were better than anything else out there. &nbsp;I was speaking with an professor at school yesterday, he used to do GUI development on Mac's around 1990. &nbsp;He was explaining how low-level the coding was, each application was responsible for drawing everything itself, when your app window got resized, you were responsible for recalculating the scrollbar size / position and redrawing it, and everything else. &nbsp;That sounds like a pain! &nbsp;<br /><br />BTW: Anybody find me a copy of Rhapsody Intel DR2 yet? &nbsp;I love playing with obsolete abandoned junk like that <img src="Smileys/default/wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" /><br /><br />Nick</div>
