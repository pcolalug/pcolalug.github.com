					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: clublug.org</div><div class="quote">From now until April 30, the registration cost for the Club LUG Conference is $225. After May 1, the cost will be $275...<br /><br />...Please note that the registration cost does not include hotel rooms.</div><br /><br />While it is cool that you would get the chance to take the LPI tests, this looks like a big promotion for the tests. The schedule of events seems to be centered around that with one topic on actual Linux User's Groups.<br /><br />This sounds like it could be a nice vacation if you can get your employer to foot the bill for you to go to New Orleans for a few days.</div>
