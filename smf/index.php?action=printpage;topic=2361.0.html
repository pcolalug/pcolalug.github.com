Thomas Herchenroeder explains how he <br />wrapped dnscmd with Perl to make changes easily.<br />http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2005/03/24/perl_dns.html<br /><br /><br />***make for Nonprogrammers<br />If you're a typical FreeBSD user, you may never have compiled C source<br />code on your own. Yet if you've ever issued a make command, it's compiled<br />code for you. How does it do that? What does it do, anyway? And what else<br />can it do? Dru Lavigne answers all of these questions.<br />http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/bsd/2005/03/24/FreeBSD_Basics.html<br /><br /><br />***Closed Source PHP<br />A look at the many different options PHP Developers have for<br />protecting their source code from prying eyes when creating<br />commercial PHP Applications.<br />http://www.sitepoint.com/blog-post-view.php?id=238739<br /><br />---------------------<br />Mac<br />---------------------<br />***Movies Made Easy in iPhoto 5 <br />One of the best features in the current crop of consumer digital still<br />cameras is their ability to capture high-quality video. iPhoto 5 is in<br />step with this evolution and provides a great environment for taking those<br />snippets and creating real movies. Derrick Story shows you how.<br />http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2005/03/22/iphoto_movies.html<br /><br /><br />***Exploring the Mac OS X Firewall <br />Like so many tools built in to Mac OS X, the firewall just works. But<br />what's really going on inside it? Peter Hickman explains why the firewall<br />works so well, and then takes you inside and shows you how to fiddle with<br />things. In the end, he returns you safely to the default settings.<br />http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2005/03/15/firewall.html<br /><br /><br />***Owen Linzmeyer (&quot;Apple Confidential 2.0&quot;) on MacRadio<br />Listen to No Starch's author Owen on the Mac Night Owl Radio on the March<br />24 show.<br />http://www.macradio.com/thursday/nightowl/index.php<br /><br />---------------------<br />Windows/.NET<br />---------------------<br />***Five More Annoying PC Annoyances <br />After his first &quot;PC Annoyances&quot; was released, Steve Bass was surprised by<br />the barrage of email he received with yet more annoyances to fix. That led<br />to the just-released second edition of &quot;PC Annoyances,&quot; where he added 150<br />more fixes to irritating PC quirks. And if that's not enough, he offers<br />five more here.<br />http://www.windowsdevcenter.com/pub/a/windows/2005/03/28/pcannoyances.html<br /><br /><br />***Microsoft, Blogging, and Transparency<br />Author James Avery recently wrote about his experiences publishing his<br />latest book and how Microsoft bloggers helped him immensely. To James, the<br />benefits of increased transparency through the use of blogs cannot be<br />understated. James is the author of &quot;Visual Studio Hacks.&quot;<br />http://dotavery.com/blog/archive/2005/03/28/2767.aspx<br /><br /><br />***Miguel de Icaza Explains How to &quot;Get&quot; Mono <br />It's perhaps the most controversial project in the open source world, but<br />this mostly stems from misunderstanding: Mono, the open source development<br />platform based upon Microsoft's .NET framework. Immediate reactions from<br />many dubious Linux developers have ranged from confusion over its<br />connection with .NET to wondering what the benefits of developing under it<br />are. Throughout the course of its four years of intense development,<br />sponsored by Novell, Mono founder Miguel de Icaza has had to frequently<br />clarify the .NET issue and sell the community on it. In this new<br />interview, Howard Wen asks Miguel to explain himself one more time.<br />http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2005/03/21/interviewmiguel.html<br /><br />---------------------<br />Java<br />---------------------<br />***Flexible Event Delivery with Executors <br />Event-handling is critical to any GUI application, and many developers<br />know the hazards of making a method call to unknown or poorly behaved code<br />from the event-dispatch thread. J2SE 5.0's concurrency utilities offer<br />more fine-grained control over how code executes. Andrew Thompson applies<br />that to offer better ways to handle events.<br />http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2005/03/23/executors.html<br /><br /><br />***Java Component Development: A Conceptual Framework <br />In general terms, a component is one or more classes with an external API<br />that satisfy some requirement. But how do you build components that are<br />really practical--that handle configuration changes or third-party<br />integration well? Palash Ghosh has some ideas about the concepts behind<br />components.<br />http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2005/03/23/components.html<br /><br />---------------------<br />Digital Media<br />---------------------<br />***HDTV on Your Mac <br />Even though the Mac is a little late to the HDTV party, you can roll your<br />own setup for not too much time or money. Erica Sadun shows you how.<br />http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2005/03/29/hdtv.html<br /><br /><br />***Resurrect Your Old PC for Music--with Linux<br />Dig that clunker out of the closet! This step-by-step guide explains how<br />to upgrade even a 486-based PC to an efficient, Linux-powered music<br />machine. Total cost? About ten cents for a blank CD.<br />http://digitalmedia.oreilly.com/2005/03/23/linuxmusic.html<br /><br />---------------------<br />Web<br />---------------------<br />***Ajax: New for 2005<br />Ajax is a term coined for an approach that utilizes the Document<br />Object Model, JavaScript, and XMLHTTPRequest to allow web<br />developers to create applications that don't require constant<br />page-refreshes to be used.<br />http://www.sitepoint.com/blog-post-view.php?id=238333<br /><br />================================================<br />&gt;From Your Peers<br />===============================================<br />Don't forget to check out the O'Reilly UG wiki to see what user groups<br />across the globe are up to:<br />http://wiki.oreillynet.com/usergroups/index.cgi<br /><br />Until next time--<br /><br />Marsee</div>
