					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I started posting and forgot to post here first. <br /><br />My name is Chris Furner and I am a student at UWF and New Horizons. <br />I live in Pensacola, Fl. &nbsp;I was a military brat so I grew all over so I am not really from any local area; I am from the usa.<br /><br />I am looking for the perfect distribution of linux ( runs 60% of my windows software plus detect all my hardware.) I have tried Corel Liunx 1.0 -crashed on install or on reboot, Cladara 2.3-Wouldn't support 440GX chipset of my 400MHz Xeon, Mandrake 8.0-installed fine but wouldn't detect the nic card so I had no internet and ran slower than windows.<br /><br />For now I am running Windows XP SP1 but I am looking to switch to linux so this is why I joined the group.<br /><br />I know a a little Html and basic but that's it as far as programming languages.<br /><br />i enjoyed the June meeting and plan to attend the next meeting in july.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hiyas Chris!! &nbsp;Welcome to our loving, disfunctional(or is it malfunctional like my Windows XP??) family!! &nbsp;BTW.... &nbsp;as far as the Winodws programs... &nbsp;you may want to look here....<br /><br />Wine HQ (http://www.winehq.org)<br /><br />Wine is a great program to use for running Windows progs.<br /><br />also here...<br /><br />Crossover Plugin (http://www.codeweavers.com/products/download_trial.php)<br /><br />Crossover Plugin is a good program to use to install browser plugins like Windows Media Plugin, Quicktime Plugin, Real Networks Plugins, and a few other goodies. &nbsp;(HINT HINT) &nbsp;Since Wine is required to run the programs that power these plugins, it comes with it!!(HINT HINT)<br />The downfall of Crossover is the annoying popup screen telling you to buy it for $24.95. &nbsp;Good program tho.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome to the boards Chris!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: Starraisin</div><div class="quote">I am looking for the perfect distribution of linux ( runs 60% of my windows software plus detect all my hardware.)</div><br /><br />I don't think you are going to find this, but with a little googling and a few well asked questions, you can achieve a system that will hopefully perform up to your expectations. I'm not going to lie and tell you linux is easy. It takes work to run well and a willingness to learn new things, but that is why most of us run it. The 60% of windows software thing...I would suggest leaving that expectation behind and start looking for open source replacements. Wine, the reimplementation of the Win32 API used to run Windows software under linux, isn't that good. Also, why would you want to run Windows software under linux when it will run better under Windows? Hardware detection doesn't always work right under Windows, so once again, that may be an unrealistic expectation. If you come into the world of linux without the expectation of it being Windows, you will appreciate it a lot more.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome! We are glad to have you aboard. <br /><br />I think the answer to Linux is to run dual-boot until you get completely on top of Linux. As much as I would like to be an all Linux household, Linux is not the best tool for everything I need. <br /><br />Again, welcome.</div>

Have you tried any of the newer ones?<br />Mandrake 9.1 (http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/) is nice. So is Redhat 9.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">One thing you'll find is that Linux users are never short on advice! I sugguest you get started with Knoppix (http://knoppix.net/). Its a cd-based distro, and by that I mean the whole thing runs from a cd. You pop it in, reboot from cd and blammo, you have a fully functional Linux desktop (complete with apps) without installing anything. It doesn't touch your installed system and mounts your local hard drives read-only. It has some of *the best* hardware detection around. If you like it, you can even install it on your hard drive. Its a great way to get the &quot;feel&quot; of Linux without spending time on partitioning, installing, and configuring.<br /><br />BTW, we are neither loving nor disfunctional, peanut! :P</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Slackware (http://www.slackware.com). &nbsp;If you're into doing things the old fashioned way. &nbsp;<br /><br />Mandrake (http://www.mandrake.com). &nbsp;If you're into bloatware :) &nbsp;(Sorry, I know like 90% of the group uses Mandrake but I couldn't help myself).<br /><br />SuSE (http://www.suse.com). &nbsp;If you like using graphical tools to do everything. &nbsp;(Unfortunately those same tools cause too many problems for &nbsp;me).<br /><br />RedHat (http://www.redhat.com). &nbsp;If you like to be standard. &nbsp;Since most everything available for linux is written on or for RedHat, and several distros are based off of it.<br /><br />hmm...<br /><br />Debian (http://www.debian.com). &nbsp;If you dare. &nbsp;I hear apt-get is nice once you get used to it. &nbsp;So is emacs, but I haven't bothered with that either.<br /><br />Gentoo (http://www.gentoo.org). &nbsp;If you like to watch compiles.<br /><br />You can grab cd-based &quot;live&quot; copies of several different distros to try them out without having to actually install. &nbsp;And they work d**n good. &nbsp;Knoppix is one, but SuSE and some of the others offer it also.<br /><br />When it comes right down to it though, any distro will offer you the same functionality and access to the same programs. &nbsp;So it doesn't really matter what you choose. &nbsp;<br /><br />You have a few choices to get your windows apps going, and they're all wine. &nbsp;If you have a good mix of programs to run, use the generic Wine (http://www.winehq.com). &nbsp;If you're mostly into getting MS Office and business apps to run, might look into the latest sources from Crossover Office (http://www.codeweavers.com/products/office/source.php). &nbsp;And if you're wanting to get games working, I guess the best bet would be the latest wine sources from Transgaming's WineX (http://www.transgaming.com/).<br /><br />Wine is a bit tricky, some programs work perfectly well, some require major tweaking to the wine configuration. &nbsp;If you let me know which apps specifically you're trying to run I can let you know if I've had success with them.<br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: imnes</div><div class="quote">RedHat. If you like to be standard. Since most everything available for linux is written on or for RedHat, and several distros are based off of it.</div><br /><br />Dear lord, that is a scary comment. I really don't see most developers using Red Hat for some reason. Red Hat is in my mind more of the &quot;linux for the masses&quot; than any other. Yes, Mandrake is geared toward desktop use and beginners, but Red Hat seems to try to do everything for everyone. Also, the reason so many people use RPMs for packaging is because so many distros use it and since it is the <b>Red Hat</b> Package Management system, the developers and package maintainers default to Red Hat as being the distro to base the RPMs on. <br /><br />And by the way, RPMs suck bad. Besides dependency hell, I don't know if any of you have looked at making an RPM from a source package. It isn't fun. Debian's .deb isn't much better, but at least you don't have to deal with dependencies thanks to apt. And portage with Gentoo is just sweet. Yes, compiles can take a while, but that is why you run several systems and put distcc on them. Ah, distributed compiling is so nice.<br /><br />Finally, apt isn't hard to use. I think I'll write an article when I get home on the simplicity that is apt. If you can use the command line at all, you can use apt.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hope to meet you at the next meetings.<br />If you take a little time to look thru the forums I am sure you will see a list of the diffrent distros we use and why might help you decide on which is best for you.</div>
