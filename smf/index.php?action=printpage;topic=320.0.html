					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just ran across one of the neatest add-ons to Mozilla/Phoenix.<br /><br />It is called Tab Extensions (http://white.sakura.ne.jp/~piro/xul/_tabextensions.html.en). It allows you to manipulate the tabs in tabbed browsing (http://www.pcolalug.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=145) in a way that you wanted to all along.<br /><br />You can duplicate a tab into a new window, move tabs around just by dragging. You can even drag a tab into another browser window.<br /><br />I have used it a little in Mozilla 1.0.1, but have not tried it in Phoenix yet. I will warn you, I have read about stability problems when running this add on. I have not experienced any problems (yet). But I recommend having another browser available so that you can go back and figure out how to uninstall this thing if it does not work for you.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Not really a killer feature, but I just found something neat. If you have multiple tabs open, you can drag a link from the window you are viewing to one of the tabs and the link will open in that tab. Or you can drag it into a blank space on your tab bar and it will open in a new tab. But that is not very special since you can just right click on the link and open in a new tab.<br /><br />This works in both Phoenix and Mozilla. I do not know if this is a native feature or if this is a feature added when I added the Tab Extensions (mentioned above). I don't think it is part of the Tab Extensions since that all seems to be additions to the &quot;right click on the tab&quot; menu.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok, I am looking through the tabbed browsing options for Phoenix. I am impressed. They have added quite a bit more functionality to this whole thing. I am saying this after I have installed the Tab Extensions. So I really do not know what was in there before and what was added later, but I suspect most of this was already there.<br /><br />I knew about the middle click, that is turned on by default. I don't think it is default in Mozilla though.<br /><br />Some of the cool things I found are:<br />Double click the tab bar will open a new tab (or one of 24 other options).<br />Same thing for a middle click or ctl+click in the tab bar.<br />Same options, but enabled separately for click/right click/ctl+click in a tab itself.<br />You can set it so that a link that would normally open a new window (any link inside a post in this forum) can be opened into a new tab without right clicking or middle clicking or ctl+clicking.<br />You can have it open every link in a new tab just by left clicking. (I don't think that is very useable).<br /><br />Many other options. Well, as I dig through this I know some of these things are specific to the Tabbed Extensions. This observation is based on what some of the options allow you to do. I know that some of them were enabled after I loaded the Extensions. So I don't know what you have available to you, but I know it is more options than Mozilla gives you. In Mozilla I believe that there were only 5 or 6 tabbed browsing options.<br /><br />All of this can be found at Tools | Preferences | Advanced | Tabbed Browsing.<br /><br />David</div>
