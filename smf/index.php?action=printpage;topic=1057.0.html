					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Dan<br />&nbsp; Now that Peach has volunteered you to burn some 9.2 isos, put me down for a copy. I would like to try the new release and on my dial-up, it is out of the question .<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;TIA<br />&nbsp; Harold</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yeah, I'll bring a 3-disc set to the meeting. &nbsp;If someone has a laptop with a CD burner, maybe you could bring it also... &nbsp;That way more people could make a copy at the meeting...<br /><br />This is somewhat of a moral dilemna too... but I'll do it. &nbsp;<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">After about 8 hours at 8-10 KB/sec, and after seeing your speed Steve, I stopped and resumed my download. &nbsp;Amazing difference, almost immediately it went over 100. &nbsp;Left it running as I went to bed and it's done as of when I got up this morning. &nbsp; :D <br /><br />Now I gotta figure out how to balance my time between a new install and watching the baseball playoffs. &nbsp;Not an easy thing to do. &nbsp;Go RedSox and Cubs!<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Danc<br />&nbsp; Please forgive me for imposing on you. I didn't read the previous posts closely enought and I did not realize the downloads were for members of the Mandrake club only. I retract my request for a copy and will wait until the formal release.<br />&nbsp; Harold :oops:</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Harold,<br /><br />It's no problem, I'll bring the CD's to the meeting. &nbsp;I thought more about it, and &nbsp;there really isn't any moral dilemna after all. &nbsp;There's nothing copyrighted about this software, and I don't mind. &nbsp;The Club membership allows me to get it early, but that doesn't mean nobody else can have it. &nbsp;Really, it's not an issue... &nbsp;See you at the meeting. &nbsp; :D <br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just to clarify for you Harold, danc is incorrect when he says that none of the software is copyrighted. *All* of it is copyrighted and the copyrights held by many different organizations and individuals. What is germane is that the programs are released under the GNU Public Licence. The GPL allows danc (and anyone else who gets a copy) to share without breaking any laws, so it's ok.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ummm..., yeah, that's what I meant. &nbsp;I guess &quot;non-commercial&quot; software would have been a better choice of words. &nbsp;Thanks, rburt3. &nbsp; :wink: <br /><br />Dan</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I figured that was what you were getting at. Since Harold is relatively new to the whole GNU/Linux/OSS thing, I thought it worth pointing out. <br /><br />This does sugguest an interesting (to me, anyway) &quot;workshop&quot; topic: &quot;The GPL and OSS licenses and what they mean in a nutshell&quot;. Prolly a bit dry, but since the *PL's are such a big part of why were able to do the things we're able to do with Linux, it may be something folks want to know about.</div>
