					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have just set up SuSE 9.0 on my Toshiba Laptop 5205-s705. &nbsp;I have everything working except my wireless and a buggy sound card setup. &nbsp;I have tried everything to get my integrated mini pci card to work with no luck. &nbsp;So I went out and purchased a Netgear ma111 based off a prism chipset. &nbsp;I still cant get it to work. &nbsp;I am new to linux. &nbsp;I have messed with it on and off for a couple years but I would like to really get involved with it now. &nbsp;Any help would be appreciated. &nbsp;<br />Thanks,<br /><br />Lee</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome to the group!<br /><br />Do you have a copy of Knoppix (http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-old-en.html)? If so, or you can download it, you might give it a try to just make sure that the combination will work with Linux. PCMCIA protocol is very well supported in Linux. I have had great sucess with any device I have used.<br /><br />If Knoppix detects it, and it works, then I would say it is possible to run down your problem with the information Knoppix will give. If it does not work under Knoppix, then chances are it won't work. That is not to say that it would be impossible, but Knoppix detects just about everything you could imagine.<br /><br />If you are not familiar with Knoppix, it is a &quot;Live&quot; CD. This means that you boot directly from the CD and your system runs in a RAM disk. Nothing is installed to the hard drive. So it can be used without &quot;installing&quot; and messing up your current setup. It also has great hardware detection. <br /><br />Again, welcome.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm guessing you got the USB MA111. It seems according to this (http://lists.shmoo.com/pipermail/hostap/2003-May/002556.html), granted from back in May, it does not work. I would suggest you search google for more information.<br /><br />For compatible hardware, I suggest checking your distribution for the list of devices that work with the version of the kernel that it comes with as well as searching google and checking the compatibility with the newest versions of the kernel.<br /><br />Oh yeah, David, the minipci devices are different than PCMCIA. They are cards like PCI, but meant for laptops.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I was trying to do my research before I went and purchased. &nbsp;I found that &nbsp;it was &quot;supported&quot;, so they say at http://www.linux-wlan.org/docs/wlan_adapters.html &nbsp;But I was unsucessful. &nbsp;I am a newbie so I could be doing something incorrect. &nbsp;I hate that I missed the last users meeting. &nbsp;I just found this group. &nbsp;I appreciate the replies. &nbsp;I am downloading the Knoppix iso as we speak. &nbsp; I had originally tried the SuSE live cd before I installed and I had already did a little reasearch and found that someone could not get the integrated mini pci wireless to work with knoppix. &nbsp;http://linux.toshiba-dme.co.jp/linux/eng/pc/memo2/sat5205.htm &nbsp;But that he could get other wireless working &quot;pcmcia&quot; based on the prism chip set.. &nbsp;I will keep looking though. &nbsp; Thanks for the help everyone.<br /><br />Lee<br /><br /><i>[2003-11-18 10:26 - Edit by crowe.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have last years model, I think the satellite 1415-s173. &nbsp;I'm running a 2.4.22 kernel under Fedora. &nbsp;I just threw out my modules list incase you're running the same hardware you can verify the same modules are loaded. &nbsp;I'm not sure what your laptop came with...<br /><br />BTW: You said your new network card runs on the prism chipset, well my wireless one runs on the prim II chipset and it seems to work, so yours should be supported...<br /><br />Nick</div>

&nbsp; It says the driver status: orinoco_cs is active.<br />Driver Activation Cmd: modprobe orinoco_cs<br />The strange thing is when I select it to configure it the card is listed as a pcmcia card.. &nbsp;Which it is not. &nbsp;Any Ideas anyone?<br />Here is the list of the modules loaded &quot;I guess lol&quot;<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">Module &nbsp;
