					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/08/26/1443201&amp;tid=88&amp;tid=136&amp;tid=123&amp;tid=1&amp;tid=106<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote"><br />4A6F656C writes &quot;In an article on LinuxWorld.com.au, Kieren O'Shaughnessy, director of SCO Australia and New Zealand, details SCO's plans for Australia, stating that they have 'prepared a hit list' and &quot;would approach Australian Linux users to ensure they had an IP licence.&quot; In closing, he adds 'Linux doesn't exist. Everyone knows Linux is an unlicensed version of Unix'.&quot; UnknowingFool writes &quot;IBM's lawyers have been busy the last few days. Groklaw has reported a number of different filings. On the heels of last week's motions (1) and (2) for summary judgement, they have filed more documents. First, IBM wants large portions of SCO's testimonies striken (removed) on multiple grounds. Deep in the motion, they call out SCO to produce the 'experts' that did the code comparison analysis. If IBM wins on most of these points, SCO will have very little left in the way of legal evidence. SCO answers on IBMs 10th counterclaim. IANAL but from I understand SCO says this copyright infringment that SCO has allegedly committed on one of IBM's patents is irrelevant to the case and the court doesn't need to decide on it. So SCO is saying that they can sue IBM for infringing on their Unix copyrights and patents but IBM can't counter sue on a specific patent. IBM also filed another memo to support summary judgement. As a matter of law, SCO has to produce evidence to backup its claims. This mountain of evidence SCO has claimed all this time: If they don't produce it, the court has to rule in IBM's favor.&quot;<br /></div><br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">thats pretty funny<br /><br />sco keeps on digging their grave deeper and deeper<br /><br />also something i still haven't come to figure out is why does sco.com run linux if linux &quot;doesn't exist&quot;<br /><br />http://uptime.netcraft.com/up/graph/?host=sco.com<br />http://sco.com was running Apache on Linux &nbsp;when last queried at 26-Aug-2004 21:16:47 GMT</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This is the funniest thing yet... cover your eyes and hope it goes away. Sure we've all heard the jokes about Daryl et al's sanity, but this takes the cake! Shhhhh, close your eyes, SCO; it'll all be over soon.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just out of curiosity, what IS SCO?<br /><br /><br />Linux doesn't exist? &nbsp;Well, um, what does my box say when I inspect the kernel? &nbsp;Fascinating, it says LINUX.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">From what I gather, SCO is an old UNIX corporation that is accusing the Linux community of stealing its code from UNIX, thus making it illegal. &nbsp;If it were true, then Linux does not exist--Linux would simply be a ripoff of UNIX. I don't think it is true. At least, I hope it's not.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm not sure, I think SCO used to be the name of a Unix distro / company or something and some new company is reusing the name and bought the Unix rights and is now suing anyone they think will pay them for using Unix / Linux technology. &nbsp;Is this right?<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The Santa Cruz Organization is and has been a Unix (notice the capital U) vendor for many years. A couple of years ago, the bought Caldera, a one-time well respected Linux vendor. Several years before that, one of them (I can't remember which) allegedly bought some Unix IP from Novell.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">To my knowledge, Linux is a Unix clone <b>written from scratch</b> by Linus Torvalds. &nbsp;I mean, written from scratch means no copied code. &nbsp;Even if there's similarities in implementation it's a totally different beast that just happens to look similar.<br /><br />If nothing else, the freakin' clone() function separates Linux from nearly everything else on the planet. &nbsp;All calls to fork(), pthread_create() and like calls are all made into clone() whereas in everything else those are all handled separately. &nbsp;The power and massive usage of clone() clearly defines a major area of usability and stability (for good or ill) from any other OS.<br /><br /><br /><br />This is like the people who tell me Linux isn't an OS. &nbsp;They tell me it's a kernel wrapped up with a lot of other applications. &nbsp;Pardon me, but where did their brains go? &nbsp;The definition of an OS as can best be described is &quot;a piece of software that interfaces with the hardware of a system and provides an interface such that the user may interact with the aforementioned hardware.&quot; Well, that's what the kernel DOES, which by definition makes it an OS. &nbsp;There's nothing about user-friendliness in there (man, if that was the issue I don't think Unix would've been around very long at all) or external apps, just that interface.<br /><br /><br /><br />This is as stupid as those people trying to patent software concepts over in Europe. &nbsp;You know, trying to say, &quot;Yeah, I came up with a 'scroll bar' so you can't do anything like that.&quot; Total BS.</div>
