					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey all I am Mike in Niceville... I know some basics but mostly using online sources and GUI based apps. I work for a Christian ISP based here in Niceville that has dialup and DSL connections across much of North America. I handle the phone based tech support.<br /><br />My distro of choice is Ubuntu but have also played around with Fedora, OpenSuse and a few others.<br /><br />My experience is primarily along the lines of hardware such as building and troubleshooting. I can do normal software related stuff but no programming related stuff.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome to the group Mike. We welcome any input you have. Particularly what kinds of common problems you experience with Linux users dialing into your system. Do you actually provide support for Linux, or is it taboo for the user to mention Linux?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">sorry always busy with work and the holidays... thanks for the warm welcome...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Particularly what kinds of common problems you experience with Linux users dialing into your system. Do you actually provide support for Linux, or is it taboo for the user to mention Linux?</div><br />almost all of our customers range of knowledge goes from barely knowing where the power button is, to at least knowing some windows basics... I think in the few years with this job, I have only heard linux mentioned by a customer 3 or 4 times. The most recent was us trying to get our internet filtering services setup on a new Acer Aspire netbook that uses a modified Linpus Linux setup just after Christmas. The proxy based setup did not work so we had to use the DNS based filtering which did work quite well. I ended up having wait almost 24 hours for the Lite version of Linpus to download, then use a VM in my Vista x64 testbed to find the placement of where to enter the proxy or DNS settings.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">btw which church are you related to?
