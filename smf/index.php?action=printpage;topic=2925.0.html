					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I thought I would pass this on. August 13 through 17, Auburn University Montgomery will be hosting the 2006 Air Force Information Technology Conference. It&#039;s free for active duty, retired active duty, local, state, or federal government employee, government contractor, college/university employee or student with valid identification. For everyone else, it&#039;s $100. <br /><br />Website here: https://ossg.gunter.af.mil/aq/AFITC/Default.aspx<br /><br />Wednesday, the 16th, Steve Balmer will be a keynote speaker! &gt;:D</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Because they suck... I mean, that&#039;s true to Air Force style. Everyone does the same thing at work in emails. They attach crap all the time as a Word doc or one slide PowerPoint presentation or one page Excel sheet. You can put all of that stuff directly into an email in Outlook! Anyhow, it won&#039;t be as technical as you might think.<br /><br />And from the crappy FAQ:<br />&quot;If you do not wish to participate as an exhibiting vendor and do not meet the criteria of an attendee, you may register as a non-exhibiting vendor for a registration fee of $100 payable to MC².&quot;<br /><br />So, yes, you can go, but it would cost you $100.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ah, OK.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t really want to visit an Auburn school anytime soon, anyways!&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />But, just curious, what kind of exhibits do they usually have at these?&nbsp; Have you ever been?<br /><br />Ian</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I went to one several years back when I talked my unit into letting me go.&nbsp; To me, it was basically like any other computer show/exposition.&nbsp; However, most of the vendors and their products were geared mainly towards military applications and standards.</div>
