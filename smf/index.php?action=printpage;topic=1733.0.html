					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I saw this movie at The Rave pensacola opening night. &nbsp;I thought it was really well done. &nbsp;Anyone else seen it and like / dislike it?<br /><br />It's obviously got some Bush bashing going on in it, which I always enjoy, but makes a lot of good points and raises some good issues for debate. &nbsp;Seems to work too, most of the people coming out of the theater seemed to want to talk about their views on the subjects. &nbsp;<br /><br />But anything that gets people talking about and being more active in the political process is good I think.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I saw it and loved it. Maybe because of my personal experiences within the past year, I found the movie stirring up emotions I didn't know I had. It was the last straw for me to stop putting off getting involved. Last night, I went to a MoveOn (http://www.moveon.org) meet up and met a lot of like minded people. Most of them had seen the movie and were also interested in helping in some way. Now, I'm helping head up the effort to organize these people so that we can inform each other about opportunities to volunteer and educate ourselves and others about the political environment we live in today so that we can all make a difference.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm not sure that P-LUG is the appropriate forum for politics, but since the subject has already been brought up, here goes...<br /><br />I haven't seen FAHRENHEIT 9/11, but I imagine that it follows in the footsteps of Michael Moore's other efforts (i.e., Roger and Me, Bowling for Columbine, Stupid White Men). &nbsp;The fact that the media and Hollywood can call his films documentaries gives a revealing insight into how far left they have moved.<br /><br />Webster defines documentary as &quot;Presenting facts objectively without editorializing or inserting fictional matter, as in a book or film&quot;. &nbsp;Propaganda, on the other hand is defined as &quot;The systematic propagation of a doctrine or cause or of information reflecting the views and interests of those advocating such a doctrine or cause.&quot;<br /><br />If you make the effort to compare Moore's representations to the facts available from many unbiased sources, you will see that his works are most generously characterised as propaganda--and probably more accurately described as fictional. &nbsp;Yes, they stir emotions. However, when you know the facts the emotions that are stirred tend to be the opposite of those who take Moore at face value.<br /><br />Ah, yes! &nbsp;MoveOn. &nbsp;Another of Billionaire George Soros pets. &nbsp;If you subscribe to Soros' view of a world dominated by a socialist government untroubled by such trivia as Constitutional rights, then by all means, go forth and exercise the rights that I spent my youth protecting for you.<br /><br />Soros provided most of the funding which supported the defense of the Campaign Reform Act of 2002 when it came before the Supreme Court. &nbsp;Thanks to his efforts, a major portion of our Constitutional right to freedom of speech has been removed. &nbsp;On September 3, 2004 and continuing through election day, you and I cannot take an Ad in the newspaper or buy a radio spot to support our candidate of choice or to criticise his/her opponent if it mentions either by name. &nbsp;To do so would leave you subject to a $25,000 fine while our obviously unbiased big media are free to say what they will. &nbsp;Freedom of political speech was the primary reason for the 1st Amendment. &nbsp;The dissenting opinions in this Supreme Court decision make intresting reading.<br /><br />In summary: &nbsp;Do not let others do your thinking for you. &nbsp;Be informed and make sure you read what the &quot;opposition&quot; has to say. &nbsp;When your emotions are stirred, &nbsp;make sure you perform a consistency check with your head. &nbsp;Make sure that the you know all of the agenda of the groups you support. &nbsp;Mea Culpa: &nbsp;I contributed to Planned Parenthood for almost twenty years before I discovered that they were one of the biggest proponents of abortion as a means of birth control. &nbsp;For twenty years I helped fund the murder of babies. &nbsp;May God forgive me.<br /><br />By the way, I didn't know about RightMarch. &nbsp;I appreciate the tip.<br /><br />&quot;When I was twenty and you weren't a Socialist, you had no heart. &nbsp;When I was thirty and you were a Socialist, you had no head.&quot; --Sir Winston Churchill</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The one thing I agree with tuxmoose on is that this probably isn't the best place to discuss these things. So that we don't hurt any feelings or detract from the focus of the group, I think we should keep politics, outside of those dealing with open source software and the advancement of it, to a minimum. There are other forums that are better suited for this subject. For that reason, I have locked this topic.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sorry guys I was really hoping to just get the responses of people who've actually <i>seen</i> this movie, and what they thought about <i>it</i>. &nbsp;I guess it's a touchy subject ;) &nbsp;<br /><br />Nick</div>
