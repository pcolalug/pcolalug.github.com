					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m using PCLinuxOS.&nbsp; I have a USB hard drive formatted in NTFS that I was hoping to share between my Windows and Linux computers.&nbsp; The USB hard drive will read files to PCLinuxOS, but I cant move files to the USB drive.&nbsp; I have looked on several support boards on the Internet, but nothing works.&nbsp; Konqueror lists the USB drive location as system:/media/sda1 </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I agree with Dan on this one, I would suggest formatting the USB drive fat and that would work quite well between both Linux and Windows.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for letting me know about the dangers of using a USB NTFS formatted drive in Linux.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t hear anything about this in any of the support forums that I have looked at.&nbsp; I have two USB drives, so I can format one of them in FAT32.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This is an interesting question to me. Did the drive come pre-formatted to NTFS? Or did you format it with NTFS?<br /><br />The reason I ask is that if it came pre-formatted to NTFS, wouldn&#039;t that make it a &quot;Windows Only&quot; USB drive? Why would they package it that way? Seems like they would want to hit the greatest audience and have the drive &quot;just work&quot; in Windows or Mac.</div>
