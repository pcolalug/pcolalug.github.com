					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Meeting will be this Thursday, June 18 at the usual location.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be doing a presentation Linux gaming, if anyone wants to they&#039;re more than welcome to bring their laptop and other appropriate equipment to set up a gaming network as part of the presentation.<br /><br />These are the games I&#039;ll be presenting that I think would be best for setting up a multiplayer demonstration:<br /><br />Assault Cube<br />Nexuiz<br />BZFlag<br />TeeWorlds<br />VDrift<br />Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory<br /><br />I will be presenting quite a few more games&nbsp; (at least 14 now, possibly more) tell me in advance so I can install the proper server files, or if you have a more powerful system (which is very likely) and would like to volunteer to host games, that&#039;d be even better.<br /><br /><br />Hope to see you all at the meeting.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Can someone bring some heat sink grease tonight? I need to install a new CPU in the morning and don&#039;t have any thermal grease with me. It&#039;s all at my other home near Cancun. Tough maintaining 2 homes.&nbsp; ;D</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">At the meeting tonight, we had a respectable 11 members in attendance.&nbsp; I snapped a few pictures for good measure!&nbsp; In attendance we had David, David, Wes, Doug, Shawn, Michael, Dan, Charles, Max. Lloyd, and me.<br /><br />(http://lh5.ggpht.com/_iL2DMGredwY/Sjr00sEcmOI/AAAAAAAAABk/gCn3mQhY1nE/s144/dscn2448.jpg) (http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/V6hUZYWQB-T2RZJFLAcriw?feat=embedwebsite)<br /><br /><br />(http://lh3.ggpht.com/_iL2DMGredwY/Sjr02vYq1nI/AAAAAAAAABw/w7USmRyXfdg/s144/dscn2449.jpg) (http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Y-USXFshM69HIcUe4U8iUQ?feat=embedwebsite)<br /><br />David (Yossarian) gave a good presentation showing off an array of fully native Linux games, opting to put off the Wine discussion for another time.&nbsp; After the presentation, there was some lively discussion going on.&nbsp; All in all, I would call it a good meeting, and am looking forward to next month!<br /><br />Ian<br /><br /></div>
