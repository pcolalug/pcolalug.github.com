					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey out there coming to live from Cluster Central......<br />Anybody know of any decent Linux wireless GUI's I am looking for something &nbsp;that will list all the surronding networks and allow you to pick which one to use. Presently I kismet for networks then command line access!<br />Any thoughts here.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The built-in network config tool in Gnome (Ubuntu) will do it. &nbsp;You click on the network icon on the panel, click Configure, and it has a drop-down list of available wireless networks. &nbsp;You can setup a network profile for each location you frequent and easily switch to set configurations. &nbsp;(Handles reconfiguring wired, wireless, and dial-up networking based on location profiles).<br /><br />Officially it's called &quot;Gnome Network Administration Tool&quot; in the help file. &nbsp;<br /><br />(http://www.cs.uwf.edu/~nsmith/gnome-network-administration-tool-ss1.png)<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The network profiles/config app in Linspire is really good. I think it will allow you to scan for available networks. You can also save profiles and switch between them on the fly as you travel from spot to spot. Don't know how hard it would be to hack in to whichever distro you're using atm and it will need the KDE libs and some other wifi stuff to work.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Wanted to point this little Gnome utility out. &nbsp;It's available for Fedora, Debian, Gentoo, SuSE, and probably everything else. <br /><br />http://people.redhat.com/dcbw/NetworkManager/<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">The desktop user should never need to use the command-line to configure their network; it should &quot;Just Work&quot; as automatically as possible and intrude as little as possible into the users workflow. The computer should use the wired network connection when its plugged in, but automatically switch to a wireless connection when the user unplugs it and walks away from the desk. Likewise, when the user plugs the computer back in, the computer should switch back to the wired connection. The user should, most times, not even notice that their connection has has been managed for them; they should simply see uninterrupted network connectivity. </div><br /><br /><b>On SuSE</b><br />(http://rlove.org/images/nm-applet-1.jpg)<br /><br />Nick</div>
