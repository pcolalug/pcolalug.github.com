					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I became interested in using Linux when Mandrake 9 first came out. &nbsp;I first downloaded the basic version, then soon decided to purchase a boxed set of CDs. &nbsp;That release came with several CDs which had lots of software on it. &nbsp;It was great; &nbsp;except that it wouldn't work with my DSL. &nbsp; <br />I reluctantly went back to Windows XP so that I could access the internet. &nbsp;I have since downloaded and installed Mandrake 10, but the 3 CDs that I burned have not much of the software that came included with the boxed version of 9....... and none of the Linux games.<br /><br />Is there a way for me to upload the software that I have on the version 9 discs?</div>
