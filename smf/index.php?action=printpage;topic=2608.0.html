					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just read an opinion piece (http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1861272,00.asp) over at Eweek (http://www.eweek.com/) that was sort of the same old Linux-is-going-to-dominate-Windows-because... piece. While I love to hear a tech pundit say how superior Linux/Unix is over Windows as much as the next Linux geek, I wonder if you guys think these journalists really have a pulse on the tech industry or if they aren't just putting a better spin to &quot;Linux is the R0x0rz!!!111!11!1111&quot;.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I disagree that Linux will be the MS killer. The more I have been playing with and talking to people about OS X, the more I think that is the next big thing. I never felt Apple was poised to do this until this move to the Intel processors (that is assuming we will be able to use OS X on the same hardware you can run Windows on). People will begin by dual booting Windows and OS X. Then they will start spending more time in OS X. Then only booting Windows to play a few legacy games. Soon, OS X will have the market share.<br /><br />The good side of this is that OS X will bring Linux right along with it. But, I am beginning to think that our biggest competition in 5 years will not be MS, but Apple. Honestly, I am very happy to see that.<br /><br />I have <b>NEVER</b> been an Apple fan because I did not like the hardware. (Much like my distaste for notebooks). But, if we can get OS X on Intel/AMD processors and run much of our current hardware, I think Apple has a shot to kill MS. And that would be just fine with me.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The only problem is Apple has no plans to allow OS X to run on non-Apple hardware. Even the latest developer build (http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/09/13/1957219&amp;tid=179&amp;tid=3) is working to avoid such &quot;piracy&quot;. So, OS X won't be the &quot;Windows Killer&quot; any more than when it was run on PPC. Even when a work-around is found to run OS X on any system, you won't have wide spread driver support except for those items that are in Apple hardware, nor will the average user go through the hassle of making it work.<br /><br />Makes me think of Windows XP x64 Edition. Despite huge sales of Athlon64 system, not many people are running WinXP x64 because they can't get drivers for their printers, scanners and other devices. Who wants to run a system as their main desktop when they have to switch back to Windows to make it all work?<br /><br />By the way, I deleted dpeach's double post.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, in all truth, Windows doesn't even support all combinations of hardware. It can be a challenge hunting down drivers for older hardware to run on newer versions of Windows or the opposite of that. Try finding drivers for the server versions of Windows...yet again, a choir. Linux's hardware support has gotten to a point that with the exception of a few areas (printers, scanners, wireless nics), you don't have to be too careful with your hardware choices.</div>

I slap in whatever card I have on hand. The only card I have ever had trouble with was a card that was borked (would not work in Windows either). I had no idea that there might be compatability issues with NICs.<br /><br />Ignorance is, sometimes, bliss.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have yet to see any compatibility problems with a NIC either (wired ethernet, anyway). &nbsp;Wireless is a whole 'nother ballgame, of course. &nbsp;On that front my only experience is with the Atheros chipset, which has worked great for me.<br /><br />Dan</div>

I would say alot of hardware is supported in linux now, but only some of it is supported *well* across multiple distrobutions </div><br /><br />The distribution doesn't matter. It's the kernel that matters and last time I checked, you can put whatever kernel you want on whatever distribution you care to run. If the kernel supports it for one distribution, then it will support it in every single other one.<br /><br />I do agree that shopping for support is a good idea, but the same goes for Mac, Windows, DOS, etc. My point is that it has gotten to a point that you don't have to worry about hardware support as much as you did a couple of years ago.<br /><br />I will say that my Radeon 9800 works extremely well with Linux. Have you seen the new installer that works almost exactly like the Nvidia installer? As long as you have the kernel headers installed and the typical build utils, you're good to go, exactly the same thing nvidia's drivers require. I haven't seen a sound card not work in recent times and almost all NICs are supported. Even the SATA controllers are getting supported.</div>
