					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi all,<br /><br />The LUG forums are about to be shifted over to new software. &nbsp;We have been using the &quot;phpBB&quot; forum software, and will be changing over to &quot;SMF&quot;. &nbsp;It is similar in looks, and has quite a few additional features that should be fun to use. &nbsp;One of the biggest reasons for the change is the fact that &quot;phpBB&quot; is often exploited with security flaws, and is kind of a pain to keep protected.<br /><br />Anyway, the change should be happening in the next day or two, when our SysAdmin and Webmaster get a chance to finish backing up and converting the database over. &nbsp;Thanks go out to Lloydr and Rugmonster for their hard work on this project. &nbsp;You will still use your same username and password to log in. &nbsp;It would probably be a good idea to go through the options/settings/profile to make sure things are the way you want them, and choose some things like your desired theme.<br /><br />The new software has been tested fairly thoroughly by the Steering Committee and seems to be working nicely. &nbsp;If you notice any strangeness or have any problems, please make a post about it so we can get it corrected. &nbsp;Enjoy the forums, and let's get busy posting!</div>
