					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have my Linux laptop, and thinking about getting an Apple Mac desktop system. &nbsp;The PowerMac is out of my price range but the new iMac is closer. &nbsp;I wanted to compare similar PC to Macs to see how the prices are.<br /><br />My only problem here is I have no idea how a 1.8ghz g5 compares to an Athlon 64. &nbsp;Also Athlon 64 is only available in single CPU configurations, so you have to go to Opteron to compare with the PowerMac G5 towers. &nbsp;But here's what I came up with anyway.<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"><br />&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$2,182<br /></div><br /><br />Some points to consider - you could drop the price of either system by using Linux and OpenOffice instead of the standard pay OS and Microsoft Office. &nbsp;(Unless you go to UWF in which case you are pretty much forced into MS Office by some of the classes).<br /><br />Also, the apple system comes with a 20&quot; widescreen LCD. &nbsp;I didn't include the price of a widescreen 20&quot; LCD with the PC. &nbsp;I was able to find them though, from BestBuy - a 20&quot; Apple cinema display is $1199 (which is supposedly the same LCD panel as the imac is using) or sticking with non-apple parts for it - a Samsung 21.3&quot; widescreen lcd is $2199. &nbsp;(see best buy (http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?id=1051384704926&amp;skuId=5344308&amp;productCategoryId=cat01013&amp;type=product))<br /><br />Another thing - I'm not sure which Athlon 64 chip would be comparable to the g5, but I went with a mid-range chip for pricing.<br /><br /><br /><br />Onto the more (much more) expensive PowerMacs...<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"><br />&nbsp;

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am a Mac owner and there are a couple of points to consider.<br /><br />1. &nbsp;Linux's desktop is getting better and better and better. &nbsp;Just following in the last year blows me away. &nbsp;Despite all of my advocacy for Mac, when it comes time to do the laptop thing again, I will compare hardware/software again like you did. &nbsp;<br /><br />2. &nbsp;You need to include the software that comes with OS X like iLife and a lot of the little utils; however, I would only include the utils that you are most likely to use.<br /><br />3. &nbsp;If you decide Mac, wait. &nbsp;Seriously. &nbsp;If you can wait, wait for OS X.4 or Tiger. &nbsp;The OS is $129 each time you upgrade, $99 for academic discount.<br /><br />4. &nbsp;You must include the APP. &nbsp;Do NOT buy an Apple without the warranty, no matter if it is a laptop or desktop. &nbsp;You are not buying something that you can jog down to Best Buy and replace the part necessarily. &nbsp;PCs are flat out more flexible over the long term.<br /><br /><br />2 cents from a guy that will have his Powerbook 15&quot; 1.25GHz and PowerMac Dual 2GHz pried from his cold dead hands. :)<br /><br />Scott</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I also own Apple and Linux computer (plus a Windows laptop just for UWF classes). I would never get rid of my Apple, if you want a computer that you just unpack from the box, plug in, and turn on. If you want a computer to upgrade and tinker with, then get a barebones desktop and install your favorite Linux.<br /><br />You can't just compare Apples and PCs-- it's like comparing oranges and, well, apples. Because the Apple uses RISC processors, clock speed is not as important as it is with PCs. Apples maintain their value longer. They have a small share of the market (there are only about three Mac owners in the universe, one of them is the CEO of Apple).<br /><br />I was sold on Apples when my friend let me play with his iMac for a day. But, if you still go to school (especially UWF), get a PC. If you take home work that requires PC software, get a PC. If you play games, get a PC. Otherwise, I would not say that Apple hardware is overpriced.</div>
