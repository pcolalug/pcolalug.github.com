					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks to the generousity of some of you out there. I am back up to full speed...well almost anyway. I do not have highspeed yet, But I am back up never the less and hope to be able to monitor the BBS and pass along helpful information. I am presently working on a Beowulf Cluster write up and a Single Cd Server Distro that would really be handy.<br />If anybody has anything they would like to see on the server Cd please let me know at bhofff@yahoo.com<br />Thanks, And it is really good to see that The LUG officers have been doing a great job at keeping the movement going that I started over a year ago.<br />Brett Hoff</div>

You'll steal my thunder! The single cd server is my baby. We can't have two server cd distros in one LUG (even though I'm not physically there to be a member...)!</div>
