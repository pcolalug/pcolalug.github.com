					Post by: <b>rugmonster</b> on <b>July 23, 2006, 09:08:46 am</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">With all of the rumors of AMD buying ATi, I&#039;ve been wondering what this will mean for both companies. Will ATi&#039;s products compete better against the nVidia? Will ATi&#039;s drivers stop sucking in Windows AND Linux? Will AMD, the company, suffer from such a buy out? I don&#039;t know. How do you think this will effect the two companies and how do you think the future of Linux support from these companies?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think some of the major changes we&#039;ll see is better compatibility between ATI&#039;s chipset and AMD&#039;s processors. More than likely there will be a lot more ATI integrated graphics with AMD mainboards. I think that AMD will push the issue of better performance support for Linux... this can make for some positive changes... <br /><br />Guess we&#039;ll see with time... </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">In case you haven&#039;t seen, it&#039;s confirmed and AMD and ATi are merging.<br /><br />ATi&#039;s motherboards and chipsets are already aimed primarily at AMD processors, so I&#039;m a little confused as to how that can get any better. There are no compatibility issues that I know of between the two. Also, AMD doesn&#039;t make motherboards. ATi does. I think we will now see the highest performing motherboards for AMD processors coming from ATi, thus pushing sales of crossfire enabled motherboards. <br /><br />Additionally, I would hope that AMD will push ATi to produce better drivers for their hardware, not only for Linux, but for Windows as well. I have always felt that all of the drivers that ATi has put out recently have sucked when compared to NVIDIA&#039;s on all platforms. Since AMD is a hardware manufacturer, I don&#039;t know if this will happen. ATi&#039;s graphics cards may benefit from better manufacturing, but that hardware can only go so fast with crappy drivers.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m actually curious as to what kind of hit Nvidia will see; seeing as though their NForce chipsets are among the most popular for AMD users</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m also interested to see how Intel will interact with ATI. Intel will probably be reluctant to exchange information with ATI due to competition between Intel + AMD. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I heard that as we move to multi-processors (quad dual-core) in the next 2 years, they will probably integrate the GPU into the CPU instead of having it on the motherboard. This would be for low end systems like on-board video is now.<br /><br />As for nVidia, it will be interesting to see how it affects the nForce chipsets and AMD. They were a good match.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I bought an ATI card once!&nbsp; I have a bad feeling about this.</div>
