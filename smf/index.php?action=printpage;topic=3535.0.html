					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just read about the release of Fedora 11.&nbsp; I have not tried it yet but intend to.&nbsp; Wonder if I will notice any difference with the ext4 file system?<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/06/09/fedora_11_review/</span><br /><br />sandspur<br />living and dying in runlevel three</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Downloaded the Fedora 11 live ISO and burnt it to a disk.&nbsp; Installed to a laptop.&nbsp; <br /><br />Installation was straightforward. Applications installed from the live DVD were understandably limited (e.g. no games and there was the lean-and-mean Abiword word processor instead of the OpenOffice suite.).<br /><br />Prior to the installation I read that Fedora 11 boasted fast boot times.&nbsp; They were not exaggerating --- it booted to the graphical login in thirty seconds.<br /><br />Connected to a home wireless LAN easily.&nbsp; Plugged in a 1 GB memory stick and it was recognized no sweat.<br /><br />No horror stories so far.<br /><br />sandspur<br />living and dying in runlevel three </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">My failure to communicate.&nbsp; I downloaded an ISO for a &quot;live&quot; version of Fedora 11 and put on a DVD capable disk.&nbsp; Booted it up and eventually elected to install Fedora 11 on my hard drive. <br /><br />Excerpt from a Wiki definition:<br /><br />&quot;The term &quot;live&quot; derives from the fact that these CDs each contain a complete, functioning and operational operating system on the distribution medium.<br /><br />While a live CD typically does not alter the operating system or files already installed on a computer&#039;s hard drive, many live CDs include mechanisms and utilities for altering the host computer&#039;s hard drive, including permanent installation.&quot;<br /><br />Hope that makes sense.<br /><br />sandspur<br />living and dying in runlevel three</div>
