					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks Chuck. It is good to know people are thinking about us down here.<br /><br />We are located at: 20°59&#039;N&nbsp; 89°39&#039;W. That will give you an idea of where we are in all of this.<br /><br />Here is a map of my state (http://mexicochannel.net/maps/mexico_maps_yucatan_roads_carreteras_sct.jpg), Yucatán. Wilma will hit Cancún which is in the state of Quintana Roo (http://mexicochannel.net/maps/mexico_maps_quintana_roo_roads_carreteras_sct.jpg). Quintana Roo is the state just east of the state of Yucatan.<br /><br />The storm will not be coming to me directly. At least that is not the projection at this time (http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/refresh/graphics_at4%2Bshtml/145344.shtml?3day?large). Things could turn and get ugly of course. I think it will be a matter of what it really does after it hits land on Friday morning. It is projected to make a 90 degree turn and head to the Keys, but we will wait and see. If it does, then it really means only rain and some wind for us. If it continues through Quintana Roo and into the main part of the Gulf just north of us, it could do what Isadore did back about 3 years ago and turn South to hit us from the North. Not a likely path, but Isadore was not likely either.<br /><br />Thanks for you concern. Keep track of this and I might be able to tell you in a few days how it turned out.</div>
