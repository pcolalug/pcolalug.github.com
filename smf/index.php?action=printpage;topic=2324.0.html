					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Very interesting...<br /><br />I am getting curious again about running Linux on the desktop. I'll have to see how SuSE is when this comes out. My main concern is throwing my girlfriend off completely with a new environment. I know my sister has a hard time sometimes when rburt3 installs a new distro or changes software around on her. I don't know what this says about things, but last I heard, she had given up on Linux and installed XP on her laptop. Anyway, perhaps I'll just do a dual boot on my desktop so I can finally take advantage of my Athlon64's 64-bit extensions. I'm very curious to see about getting Windows games working with Cadega. My main concern at the moment is CS:S and Half-Life 2 DM</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hahaha, <br /><br />Seriously though, you floridians don't get to consider yourself southern. &nbsp;The south ends at the florida line, (maybe with the exception of some border cities like jay).<br /><br />When ever I tell someone where brewton is, I say, it's just about as far south as you can go without hitting florida &nbsp;:wink: .</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think Florida has two types of people--native people actually from Alabama, or retired military and miscellaneous retired from Ohio, Michigan and other points North. So, technically, Florida is part of the South. Some of us are just transient, some of us belong in Alabama. <br /><br />I tell people I from L.A. They ask, &quot;Where? Compton? Oxnard? Beverly Hills?&quot;. To which I reply, &quot;Pensacola&quot;. L.A. = Lower Alabama. <br /><br />BTW, my family is originally from Chicago. All my neighbors are from Detroit, going back a generation or two.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">From what I've read online, paragraph 2 under Rights and Licenses of the SuSE 9.3 Pro EULA states:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">The Software is a collective work of Novell. &nbsp;You may make and use <br />&nbsp;unlimited copies of the Software for Your distribution and use within <br />&nbsp;Your Organization. &nbsp;You may make and distribute unlimited copies of <br />&nbsp;the Software outside Your organization provided that: 1) You receive <br />&nbsp;no consideration; and, 2) you do not bundle or combine the Software <br />&nbsp;with another offering (e.g., software, hardware, or service). </div><br /><br />If that turns out to be true (my copy hasn't arrived yet), I'll bring duplicates to the next meeting for anybody who wants to try it out. &nbsp;I'll let you know how it does when it finally arrives anyway.<br /><br />Nick</div>
