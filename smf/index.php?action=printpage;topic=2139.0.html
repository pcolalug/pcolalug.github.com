					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Alright, I give up, how do I compile the kernel in Debian? &nbsp;I get the feeling I'm just totally not understanding something.<br /><br />I cannot make xconfig because I get:<br /><br />foxx@anubis:~/Downloads/src/linux-2.6.7$ make xconfig<br />*<br />* Unable to find the QT installation. Please make sure that the<br />* QT development package is correctly installed and the QTDIR<br />* environment variable is set to the correct location.<br />*<br />make[1]: *** [scripts/kconfig/.tmp_qtcheck] Error 1<br />make: *** [xconfig] Error 2<br /><br /><br />Now I've been trying to get the QT runtime libraries installed with the package system but apparently to no avail. &nbsp;Also, when I tried to get libqt it told me it wanted to remove 223 packages, all of those pertaining to kde pretty much.<br /><br /><br />Now I'll admit that I don't exactly understand QT or what it's for, but that doesn't seem like a good thing if it's going to remove quite a few packages central to KDE.<br /><br />Please help.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Somehow I feel this will come up again, though. &nbsp;Surely the sole purpose of the QT libraries isn't only for xconfig, right? &nbsp;I mean, they've got to be used for something else that I might run into?<br /><br /><br />For the moment I suppose I'll have to, though.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Debian has their packages structured like this....<br /><br />Stable - The current main distribution. These are stable as stable come and are only updated beyond the release for security purposes. These packages are somewhat dated, but great for servers.<br /><br />Testing - These are packages that are newer than those in Stable, but can be somewhat dated. These are what are being considered for the next release and are considered stable enough to be tested by the large group of Debian users who are comfortable using this set of packages for their desktops.<br /><br />SID (Unstable) - Still in development... this is about as bleeding edge as Debian will get. These are the builds of the latest releases the package maintainers throw out there to the masses to test. Once they are found to be mostly stable, they go into Testing. SID can be quite hairy though.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yeah, the dev or devel means it is a package for development. It is to seperate it from the normal package that most users need. For instance, most people want trolltech's QT library so that KDE can run or whatever other QT apps you have can use it. But the normal QT library doesn't include all the things you would need if you are using QT to develop an application. So those who want to use it for development install the extra stuff they need(the devel package) and everyone else doesn't have to worry about extras they won't use installed on their system.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Not to grouse, but this is one reason why most binary based distros will never appeal to me. &nbsp;<br /><br />Why distrobutions continue to structure their librarys this way elludes me. &nbsp;Being able to compile just about anything from source is a MUST for me (though I don't have the time to compile everything). &nbsp;One thing I love about slackware is it has a small set of core libs which you can use to compile just about anything. &nbsp;<br /><br />When I look at the list of .rpm or .deb -dev packages it's overwhelming. &nbsp;Most bin distros don't even include the core libs by default. &nbsp;Of course you can install them individually yourself, but there's a bloody dev extension for just about every binary package out there. &nbsp;<br /><br />Of course, I'm sure for those of you who use bin distros you've learned the in's and out's of your particular flavor of linux. &nbsp;I try to learn a new distrobution until it annoys me...which usually doesn't take too long since I have my mothers patience.<br /><br />P.S. &nbsp;Merry christmas everyone! &nbsp;I gtg ...it's 11:48 santa's on his way :^p</div>
