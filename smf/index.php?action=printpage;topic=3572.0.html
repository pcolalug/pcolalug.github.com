					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Please plan to attend the September meeting on Thursday September 18 at 6:00 pm at System Specialists. All the details can be found on the front page: http://www.pcolalug.org<br /><br />Next month is election time. We will start taking nominations for our Steering Committee at the September meeting and continue to do so through the forums into the month of October. This is a great meeting to start your campaign for a position within the LUG.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I was very interested in some software that Ed mentioned (http://www.pcolalug.org/smf/index.php?topic=3568.0) the other day and asked if he would please give us a short presentation on it. He has agreed to do so. This is a VNC package that I think will be of interest to those of us who want an easier way to set up a VPN/VNC.<br /><br />The VPN is through Hamachi, which I talked about at a previous meeting (http://www.pcolalug.org/smf/index.php?topic=3426.0). Then the VNC is provided through FreeNX by Nomachine.<br /><br />I am looking forward to learning about the FreeNX software (http://www.nomachine.com/download.php) as I have a need to do the very thing he is doing with his setup.<br /><br />Thanks for agreeing to present this Ed.</div>
