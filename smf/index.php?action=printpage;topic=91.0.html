					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">OK. Now is the time to start proposing items to discuss at the 17 Aug. meeting.<br /><br />A couple of things I'd like to see discussed are:<br /><br />A. The status of the PcolaLug fliers. Do we have some ready? Can we start distributing them to the bookstores, etc?<br /><br />B. We have a lot of stuff that was gotten for the Expo. (I'm sorry to hear about it, but life goes on.) Anyway, what do we want to do with all the CDs that Mandrake sent, etc.? I suggest we see about putting them in the bookstores to give away. It'll help the stores sell books and we could put a small flier in each CD jacket about the club. This would need to be done fairly wuickly as Mandrake has already released 2 betas of the next version and we wouldn't want to be the user group that distributes out of date software.:)<br /><br />Anyway, that's about all I have. The main thing is to see the group grow to where we have enough regular members to distribute tasks and get things running smoothly.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think we may need to formalize some method by which folks can submit proposals for meeting presentations, get approval/sugguestions, and then have said presentations put on the agenda of some future meeting.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sorry I am going to miss this meeting. I like the suggestion of having people volunteer to give a presentation. It would not have to be something long. Just if you have configured or installed something and feel you understand it a little more now than when you started, you could let us know what to expect when we get ready to do the same thing.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I agree that we need to formalize the process for people to give presentations.<br /><br />We need to see where we are at on our flyers, also on possible sleeves for the MAndrake cd's we have to hand out.<br /><br />I would like to talk about getting more activity going out at UWF.<br /><br />And finally I have several books provided by O'reilly, What I was thinking was that we could have a central library. People could check them out and then bring them back at the determined time for someone else.<br />The books along with names would be posted on the board so everyone could see where the books are. O'reilly will provide more books about every three months plus if there is a book out there they will send it when I request it if wqe do a right up on it and send it to them to look at.<br /><br />Well that's All I got see you there<br />Brett Hoff</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I like the idea of a Library. &nbsp;We'd need to elect a librarian as well. &nbsp;Books could be &quot;checked out&quot; via the forums or even a small web app on the site. &nbsp;The books would be &quot;delivered&quot; at the meeting and due the following meeting (See, another great reason to be at the meetings!)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">While we're on the subject of O'reilly Books, Books-A-Million has a bunch of them on sale for around $10. So, bring some cash with you tomorrow.<br /><br />Steve</div>
