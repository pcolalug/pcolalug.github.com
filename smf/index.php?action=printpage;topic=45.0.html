					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I adjunct out here at UWF and this is the most Linux Free campus I have ever<br />seen in my life. I've been here for over a year and only know 4 faculty members<br />that use Linux and have only met a handful of students that use it. <br /><br />Anyone interested in doing something on campus to propagate the use of Linux?<br /><br />I'll try to get some fliers around the CS dept about this Saturdays meeting, but <br />there are not that many people around in the summer. <br /><br />Any UWF Students out there?<br /><br /><br />dale</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">My company has a contract to teach out at the Computer Science building. We teach the Navy Networking and programming classes. Maybe I can talk to some of the Profs and see if there is anything we can do.<br /><br />I did have a Linux firewall setup for the Navy Classes since UWF doesn't seem to put their network behind any kind of firewall, but the powers that be took it down because they didn't know Linux.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">There has been several attempts to get Linux out there but each time the powers that be shoot it down. I have several people out there right now in the master program that use Linux but the school does not like to use it for reasons Steve has listed.<br />Ignorance</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think that if Brett offered to buy a cup of coffee for any UWF student that shows up, we could have a few there at the meeting. &nbsp;:D <br /><br />I would offer, but I won't be there this month and I will be broke next month. So it is up to Brett to round up the money for the coffee.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">A year or so ago, JR Arthur and some of my fellow OS students tried to get one going. &nbsp;The time students and faculty had to devote to such a thing seemed to be a bigger factor than any sort of institutional support. &nbsp;Also, getting equipment to use was solely up to the members. &nbsp;As a result of theses issues (as well as a certain (former) UWF professor's refusal to allow mere students access to his Beowulf cluster...) the whole thing kind of tanked.<br /><br />Several months ago, I emailed JR, trying to stir up some more interest along with another former student, but work got in the way and I never followed up. Maybe he would be interested in helping to get the word out?<br /><br />By way of introduction, My name is Randall Burt. &nbsp;I graduated with a degree in Computer Science from UWF a year ago, August. &nbsp;I started using Free/Open Source software by happenstance when I was looking at building a firewall for my home. &nbsp;I installed FreeBSD on a spare machine at work and have never looked back. &nbsp;Currently, I am employed as a systems application developer with Dyntel. &nbsp;At work, I use Windows 2000 and Visual Basic, and I think it is slowly killing me inside. ;) &nbsp;I like web and db programming, long walks on the beach, Qt, and Apache modules. &nbsp;I run SuSE 8.0 at home with KDE 3.0.2. &nbsp;I'm really glad I found you folks (through SquishedMosquito.com) and can't wait for the meeting (*and* I'm bringing a friend!).<br /><br />&lt;rant&gt;<br />As an aside, why is it so impossible to get a shell account out there!? &nbsp;My wife is a Business major and wanted to use the Solaris machines, since we started running Linux at home and they said she had to be in one of the &quot;blessed&quot; CS courses. &nbsp;(Its not like the Unix lab is packed...)<br />&lt;/rant&gt;</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi everybody, my name is Liang and I am the guy who join the meeting after it was over. &nbsp;It is very nice to meeting all of you, finally I feel coming home. &nbsp;As rburt3 had indicated, I was one of the student who started the LUG in UWF for the same reasons the forum have mention -- lack of Linux/UNIX usage in UWF. &nbsp;In my opinion it is not matter of lack of resources, rather it is lack of interest. &nbsp;UWF has a unix lab with roomful of sun workstations. &nbsp;CS department has linux server (hermitcrab.cs.uwf.edu) for those who like to have shell account. &nbsp;Make inquery with Clif (the sys admin) for detail. &nbsp;However Clif is one of the person who strongly resist the idea of open source (linux) for security reason which is ligitiment as far as the university's policy concern. &nbsp;<br /><br />Liang<br />ps. would post more later. &nbsp;I am terrible at writing !</div>
