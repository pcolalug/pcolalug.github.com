					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay, now that I posted in my previous thread the wonders of gnome, I am beginning to get frustrated with it. Namely, this crap with GTK+ 1.2 and 2.0. You have one set of freaking applications which use the GTK 1.2 definitions which don't support antialiased fonts, including Evolution 1.2, which is a quarter of the applications I use. &nbsp;You throw in Phoenix, which I'm guessing doesn't use GTK+ at all, but not entirely sure on that one and it is easy to have three different fonts within three different windows. Yes, it is petty and small, but the more I deal with it, the more it grates at me. I hope this issue gets resolved by someone. This is one of those things that makes choice such a burden. ARGH!!!<br /><br />Oh yeah, I found out Metacity and Sawfish don't support multiple backgrounds (what a crock!), so I may end up going back to KDE and reconfiguring the UI as much as I can. Gnome just seems to be more responsive (as I'm typing responsive, I get lag on the screen &nbsp;:roll: )<br /><br />Today is not a good day for me and the linux desktop. It didn't help that I was having a bad day with my C studies. I say again...ARGH!!!</div>

Might I sugguest FreeBSD for a few days. Think of it as a break... ;)</div>

I guess it all came down to the fact that I didn't feel like learning emacs. I like vi and I was feeling lazy and I whine sometimes....<br /><br />The thing that was frustrating me was that I knew there had to be a better way to do this exercise, but my knowledge base is too narrow to implement what it is I wanted to do and then the whole desktop just added to that frustration.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: rburt3</div><div class="quote">Might I sugguest FreeBSD for a few days.

I'll be breaking out partition magic tonight to make some room for it &nbsp;:wink:</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Is there a way with Gnome 2.0 to not use the AA fonts? I don't know why this is bothering me so badly. <br /><br />By the way, I'm making my first hits to the forums with IE...I feel bad, but then again, I am installing FreeBSD on my laptop. I should at least be using Phoenix though...</div>

Or at least Mozilla. <br /><br />Thanks for the tip on Phoenix. I have enjoyed using it. Have you found any reason to make that your only browser over Mozilla? The only &quot;wow&quot; feature that I have found is the multiple homepages. Does it have anything else?<br /><br />David</div>

The only &quot;wow&quot; feature that I have found is the multiple homepages. Does it have anything else? </div><br /><br />My main reason for using Phoenix is that it is just a browser instead of a whole package such as Mozilla (with email, irc, dev, etc). I have Evolution for my mail, so I don't have a need for all the other extras. Also, Phoenix seems to me to just be faster than Mozilla. The search box next to the address bar is handy because I google quite often. The default theme is also nice. I hate having to go look for themes to make the menus, buttons and other necessities small and unobtrusive to what matters.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Good points. I use the Pinball theme in both Mozilla and Pheonix. I use the search function in Mozilla where you just type in your search words, then &quot;tab&quot; and it will search your engine of choice. My choice is Google. I like being able to google and type urls in the same box.<br /><br />David</div>
