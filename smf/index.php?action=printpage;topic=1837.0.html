					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This little discussion might be placed in the Recreational Paranoia area.<br /><br />I'll attempt to justify it by saying that security awareness is more a state of mind rather than reliance on specific hardware or software. &nbsp;Any tidbit is worth knowing.<br /><br />What we bang out on a keyboard is subject to keystroke logging software and hardware, video monitoring, TEMPEST attacks, and stuff of which I am unaware.<br /><br />When I generate text files I am going to encrypt I prefer to do it on a stand-alone machine. &nbsp;In this case a relic DOS HP palmtop computer. &nbsp;I save the file to a Flash Memory card in the palmtop.<br /><br />(Thanks to LUG members for teaching me to get a memory card reader working on my Linux PC. &nbsp;It started off as a technique to get photos off a memory card from a digital camera.)<br /><br />I take the memory card out of the palmtop and put it in the memory card reader on my Linux box. &nbsp;I'm running FC2 at the moment and the memory card is located at:<br /><br />/mnt/flash along with floppy and cdrom.<br /><br />At a terminal I'll type mount /mnt/flash.<br /><br />I can cd to /mnt/flash and type ls to see what is on the memory card.<br /><br />Among other things I may see the file I generated on the palmtop, lets call it note.txt. &nbsp;<br /><br />Here comes what I think is the cool stuff.<br /><br />With Linux PGP I used to copy the file on the card to some directory on the Linux PC and then encrypt and wipe the original file.<br /><br />Let us say the text file is in my /home/sandspur directory and I''m going to encrypt it for my PGP pal Mike and then wipe it.<br /><br />pgp -ew note.txt Mike<br /><br />Big deal. &nbsp;Here is what I have discovered. &nbsp;If I have the flash card mounted I can give PGP the absolute path to the text file like so:<br /><br />pgp -ew /mnt/flash/note.txt Mike.<br /><br />The file is encrypted and wiped on the memory card. &nbsp;Now I can copy the encrypted file to the PC and send it to Mike as an e-mail attachment.<br /><br />I'll not forget to type umount /mnt/flash when I'm done.<br /><br />SUMMARY<br /><br />The text file was generated by what I consider a secure stand-alone computer and when the memory card was on the Linux box the file was encrypted and then wiped on the memory card. &nbsp;THE TEXT FILE WAS &nbsp;NEVER ON THE PC'S HARD DRIVE!<br /><br />OK everyone. &nbsp;You can wake up now. <br /><br />&nbsp;:D <br /><br />Chuck<br />http://www.pcola.com/sandspur/</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I thought you might want to know about some tools along this line that I ran across in another life. &nbsp;<br /><br />Knoppix STD http://www.knoppix-std.org/<br /><br />I can't say enough about this cd. &nbsp;It comes with TONs of security related programs. &nbsp;(crypto, stego, pen testing, and much much more)<br /><br />Tinfoil Hat linux http://tinfoilhat.shmoo.com/<br /><br />Remember that standalone palmtop you were talking about? &nbsp;This is a linux distro on a floppy, designed to manage PGP keys. &nbsp;Before you say it's vunerable to hardware loggers, EM radiation detectors, Power consumption monitors, alien probes or a direct hit from a thermonuclear device read the README http://tinfoilhat.shmoo.com/readme.txt<br /><br />Honestly this guy is the god of paranoia.<br /><br />Brent</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just playing the paranoid part (sucks to work information protection), just mounting the flash disk opens up the possibility of it being read, should there be some malicious logic residing on your system.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Brent--- &nbsp;you are sure right about the tinfoilhat guy.<br /><br />Rugmonster ---good point about mounting the flash card being a potential vulnerabolity.<br /><br />Chuck<br />http://www.pcola.com/sandspur/</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Rugmonster --- my military background predates computer experience. &nbsp;I was a jarhead helicopter pilot who got out in 1972. &nbsp;Viet Nam service mid 69-mid70. &nbsp;The only encryption I was aware of then was when we got some device called the KY-28 used with air-to-air radios. &nbsp;The avionics guys changed the codes every day.<br /><br />When you used it &nbsp;sounded as if you were talking in a barrel.<br /><br />Chuck<br />http://www.pcola.com/sandspur/</div>
