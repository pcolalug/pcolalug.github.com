					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><b>Book Review<br />By: Brett <br /><br />Practical Unix &amp; Internet Securit</b><br /><br />&nbsp; Wow where to begin, First I would like to say that my forte is Network security and this book really covered it all.<br />Had nice presentation, easy to follow and was very detailed. From the opening line to the last page this book has <br />something for everybody that is interested in keeping there computers and network secure and safe!<br />&nbsp; I have tried several of the what-if's and scripts provided or recommended settings on my own network and they <br />worked as describe. There was a lot of research put into this book and also timely material so as to not be outdated<br />when it hits the shelves. The Appendixes very an especially nice touch with loads of valuable information and checklist.<br />&nbsp; I would not hesitate to recommend this book to everyone from Novices on there home computer to Network admins <br />running multi billion dollar operations.<br />&nbsp; Again very well done!<br />~Brett~<br />Pcolalug<br />www.pcolalug.org<br /><br /><br />Side note: this article has been posted to Amazon.com along with article for Unix Power tools under PcolaLUG.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Practical, indeed, and insightful! &nbsp;Loaded with security principles and procedures to enforce those principles. &nbsp;A valuable, lasting security guide for its principles alone; this is not one of those books that will be obsolete in a couple years. &nbsp;Very broad, covering all major aspects of computer security; it's like many books in one. &nbsp;Teaches the <i>what</i>s, <i>why</i>s, and <i>how</i>s of each aspect. &nbsp;Also contains some history as well as some humorous accounts. &nbsp;Descriptions and procedures are applied to the most popular Unix systems (focuses on Solaris, Mac OS X, Linux, &amp; FreeBSD, but discusses many more). &nbsp;Very educational, understandable, and practical--even for newbies like me desiring to lock down their system. &nbsp;Appendix contains a helpful security checklist summarizing each chapter's content. &nbsp;One excellent security resource!!<br /><br />This review was also submitted to amazon.com (7/19/03) and allbookstores.com (7/19/03).</div>
