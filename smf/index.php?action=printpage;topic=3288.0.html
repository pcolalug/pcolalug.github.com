					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey guys, I&#039;ve been busy working on a new project some of my old church members have been starting. <br /><br />The Red Door is an outreach ministry operating under Generation Impact Ministries, a recognized 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation. Our purpose is to meet the spiritual needs of Pensacola&#039;s youth/young adult culture with the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We will be open Thursday - Sunday until summer and then our hours will increase. Red Door will host youth rallies, independent film festivals, theme nights, comedy events (clean), open-mic nights, movie nights, lock-ins, music shows, girl&#039;s only nights, guy&#039;s only nights, and much more. We plan to provide leadership training, discipleship, peer counseling and events that will speak to youth and young adult issues. Eventually we would love to have a suicide prevention hot-line and provide crisis counseling.<br /><br />We are currently setting up our building and looking for live sound equipment, computers, network equipment, TV&#039;s, game systems, tables, kitchen equipment, chairs, sofas, benches etc. We are a licensed 501(c)(3) charitable organization. We currently do not have the funds to purchase equipment. We would hope you would consider donating to us as a tax write off. We would love to meet with you and answer any questions you might have.<br /><br />Give me a call guys 850-206-3557 (I might not answer, my phone min are low) Or email me (will get within 15 min and will respond) at andrew@reddoorvenue.org</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi Andrew,<br /><br />What minimum specs are you looking for as far as processor and memory requirements, etc.?&nbsp; I might have one or two PIII computers that I can contribute.<br />Are you planning on using Linux as the OS?&nbsp; If so, which distro?<br />What type of software applications will be needed?<br />About how many computers do you expect the outreach ministry will need?<br /><br />Thanks for making a difference!<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey guys, <br /><br />Really I need any boxes you can get me. I&#039;m going to go as small as possible with them, some simple internet cafe centered distro. I&#039;m currently looking at zencafe. Any suggestions are welcome. As far as network stuff. I need a 5-10 port router and hopefully a wireless router or access point. Also I need about 100-200 ft of cat 5 if anyone has it and some hardware for the cable. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi Andrew,<br /><br />Do you still need some computers?&nbsp; If so, how many?&nbsp; I&#039;ll check with my employer to see if they have any they can donate.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if they do, but it doesn&#039;t hurt to ask.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks guys that is awesome. I&#039;d like to have at least 8 computers for the actual internet cafe part. Also we need a few decent computers for the office/sound booth. (I&#039;m going to do a live audio feed from some of the shows.) I will also be setting up two servers and a firewall. Also if anyone has a decent wifi router sitting around let me know as we would like to provide free wifi. <br /><br />Guys feel free to call me and I&#039;ll set up times for me to pick up the stuff. 850-396-4195</div>
