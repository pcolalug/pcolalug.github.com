					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yeah. Not surprising, but the media used to at least TRY to conceal their bias. I love how they say &quot;Stop telling us we&#039;re mindless sheep under the sway of Microsoft&quot; under a big MSNBC logo... No, you&#039;re not mindless sheep under the sway of Microsoft; you ARE Microsoft.<br />Still, all the others were right on... and Zune should have been where Linux was.<br />Zune, for people who want an iPod but don&#039;t like Apple. Zune, for people who want an iPod but only trust Microsoft.<br />Yeah.<br />Yeah, there were a lot of digs at Apple, but the iPod accessories one was warranted, for sure. It wasn&#039;t about the iPod but about the silly boom boxes you&#039;re supposed to buy to plug them into (rather than running a patch cable to your hi-fi&#039;s aux port, eh?). And I agree that the thing about having one earbud hanging out is annoying as all get out!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I take offense to #7!&nbsp; My neck may be ugly but at least it isn&#039;t hairy!<br /><br />And the I think the reason they didn&#039;t include Zune accessories was because either a) there are no over-priced zune accessories&nbsp; or b) nobody owns a zune.<br /><br /><br />&lt;blasphemy&gt;<br /><br />I don&#039;t own either a Zune or an iPod, and I have to say, from what I&#039;ve experienced in when using those belonging to friends, I prefer the Zune (time-wise, the majority goes to the iPod, due to its market saturation).&nbsp; I also once tried iTunes, and after I fought a losing battle with it as it took over my computer converting all my files, I realised that WMP never tried to do that.&nbsp; Microsoft may be more open than Apple in this respect but it didn&#039;t convert my wavs and flacs into wmas!<br /><br />&lt;/blasphemy&gt;</div>
