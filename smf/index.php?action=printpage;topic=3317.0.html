					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for your input about external modems, I would be happy to go in that direction but I am finding they have little or no documentation regarding Linux. Or, do they all work with linux because of the nature of the beast ? I would be grateful if someone would recommend an external serial modem. Would a USB external modem work just as well?<br />Thanks for your help and God Bless,<br />Ralph..............</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It&#039;s been a LONG time since I tried a modem, but any external modem should work fine since it depends only on the built in serial port drivers.&nbsp; Of course you&#039;ll need an application or dialer (such as minicom or ppp) to get connected to anything.&nbsp; As far as brands, I always had good results with USRobotics modems.&nbsp; I would stay as far away as possible from anything using USB.&nbsp; Good luck.<br /><br />Dan<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ralph<br />&nbsp; I have a DIAMOND Supra Express 56k external modem with a serial nine pin connector. Yours, free of charge, if you want it. I can bring it to our next meeting.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Harold</div>
