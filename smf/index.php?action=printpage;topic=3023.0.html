					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">First, let me say, thus far into my testing of xubuntu, I have been really impressed.&nbsp; <br />See http://www.pcolalug.org/smf/index.php?topic=2993.0<br /><br />However, I&#039;ve run into a problem repeatedly that stems back to debian itself.<br /><br />For some reason, debian developers can&#039;t resist mucking around with packages that do not fit their definition of &quot;free software&quot;.<br /><br />For instance, don&#039;t bother installing anything that requires java from the package management system.&nbsp; Everything is linked and crosslinked with gcj (and it&#039;s multitude of dependencies).&nbsp; For that reason, your better off getting Open office, azureus and others from their respective official download sites.&nbsp; <br /><br />Another thing that I came across today, while trying to burn the latest version of Knoppix, is the fact they&#039;ve rewritten parts of cdrtools in their binary version, and introduced several nifty bugs in the process. <br />See http://cdrecord.berlios.de/old/private/cdrecord.html<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Warning: do not use Debian binaries as they include many Debian specific bugs and still do not run correctly on Linux-2.6<br />Be careful with cdrecord derivates from Debian, Debian seems to ignore the new constraints for<br />SCSI pass through on Linux-2.6. As a result, that they still incorrectly believe that it is possible<br />to use SCSI pass through as non-root on Linux-2.6, they created a cdrecord variant that tries to hide<br />the problems instead of dealing with the problems.<br /></div><br />To be fair, suse and redhat are also guilty of this to some degree.<br /><br />You all know I don&#039;t have a high tolerence for this sort of thing in distributions.&nbsp; I have to say, as nice as *buntu is, this is pushing it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">No, this should help.<br /><br />http://www.getautomatix.com/<br /><br />More of the non-free stuff is there. You have to realize that Debian is upholding <i>ideals</i>. I can&#039;t think of a single distro that does it all 100% right, but Debian and Ubuntu have gotten the closest to it for me. By the way, I&#039;ve never had a problem with cdrecord under Debian Unstable or Ubuntu. I don&#039;t know what he&#039;s complaining about.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, took the authors advice, downloaded and compiled the vanilla sources after uninstalling the debian binaries.<br /><br />I successfully burned my knoppix disc, after making two coasters from the previous tools.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">By the way, I&#039;ve never had a problem with cdrecord under Debian Unstable or Ubuntu. I don&#039;t know what he&#039;s complaining about.</div><br />Dude I included both a quote from the site, and a link to it.&nbsp; <br /><br />If a tree falls in the woods, and lands on my house instead of yours, don&#039;t say it didn&#039;t fall.&nbsp; Likewise, if I get bit by a bug that is documented to exsist in the software...well there&#039;s obiously a bug now isn&#039;t there?&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />I&#039;m sticking with xubuntu for now.&nbsp; Sure, I found a few rough edges, but it&#039;s nothing a subtle application of brute force won&#039;t fix.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">eh?&nbsp; The most annoying package screwup I&#039;ve dealt with from Debain completely obliterated my startup scripts, it was fixed within an hour and I just happened to be unlucky.&nbsp; As for the CDRecord thing, I&#039;m sure that&#039;ll sort itself out.</div>
