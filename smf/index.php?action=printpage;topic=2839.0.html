					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I use SuSE 10.0 and I have little problem. I&#039;d need something which would make quicktime-files from webpages working. Downloading is not an option, I need to hear and/or see straight from the page. So, does anyone have any idea what I should do? This is example, stupid one, but still example, I need to hear the music from this (http://vadersings.ytmnd.com/) and if that one works, I think every other file should work too. I&#039;m using Mozilla Firefox 1.0.7 finnish version.<br /><br />I&#039;ve found some instructions, but for ubuntu, and because I&#039;m not changing my os, I&#039;d like to find some help from here.<br /><br />And, apologies from my bad english, hope you&#039;ll understand.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Assuming you&#039;re not just a Forum-spammer (the IP does come from Finland...), and want to generate traffic on that &quot;website&quot;...&nbsp; It works just fine for me with Firefox and the &quot;mplayer-plugin&quot;.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure you can find an RPM of that to install on SuSE if you look around a little.&nbsp; Good luck.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have had problems with Quicktime files playing through Mplayer. Unfortunately, at this time, the newer Quicktime files are not supported by any product under Linux. Thank Apple and their closed format. My suggestion would be to contact the site administrator and request they use another format. If it is audio, then ogg would be the ideal solution, mp3 being next. For video, XviD video with ogg audio encoding is ideal (both open source and fully supported), but XviD with mp3 would work too. MPlayer does support a good deal of support for most video and audio formats, just not Quicktime.<br /><br />For SUSE packages of Mplayer (if they are not available in YaST), you can visit Packman&#039;s page (http://packman.links2linux.org/?action=index). He has some of the best packages available for multiple versions of SUSE. <br /><br />Mplayer (http://packman.links2linux.org/?action=128)<br />mplayerplug-in (http://packman.links2linux.org/?action=319) (for Mozilla/Firefox to use Mplayer)<br />w32codecs (http://packman.links2linux.org/?action=046)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I dunno if it exists in plug-in form -- but Sun has a license agreement with Apple to include QuickTime support in Java, so java based media players can playback quicktime content.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t know if any of them work as plug-ins.<br /><br />jmplay is one player you can look for.<br /><br />Nick<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hehe, no I&#039;m not generating traffic on that, it&#039;s just one random page that doesn&#039;t work with me.<br /><br />I installed mplayerplug-in and w32codecs rugmonster linked, it didn&#039;t help. Firefox still says that it needs plug-in.<br /><br />But, it&#039;s maybe lots of easier to try to get those work through wine? I already use macromedia shockwave-based pages with firefox and wine.</div>
