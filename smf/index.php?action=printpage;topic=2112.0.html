					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If &nbsp;you wanted to get into the admin market and get experience, this would probably be fine. &nbsp;Still, at $10 hour, even in a employer's market, they are simply taking advantage of people that do that job.<br /><br />Scott</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It's called business. The company pays what the job is worth to them. If no one applies for the job then they can either raise their rate or not hire anyone. If someone applies at the $10 rate and gets hired then both parties are satisfied. <br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Steve, you are correct. I was once an underpaid youth when I worked at the ISP. When I went there, I knew how to get around the file structure, look at files (didn't know vi yet) and I know how to reboot and shutdown the machine. That was the extent of my knowledge for linux and all of our servers ran it. I was also paid around $6.00 an hour.<br /><br />I eventually learned... and I learned a lot. The guy that I worked with (and kind of for) was an excellent teacher. He taught me the concepts rather than the applications and gave me a very broad foundation for all things computer. I left the company after two years with my A+ certification and a wealth of knowledge. I think I was making somewhere around $9.00 an hour.<br /><br />When I joined the Air Force and went to my first base, I was almost put into the telephone shop. Once I told them of my experience with the ISP, they changed their minds and swapped me for another person and put me into my current job of Information Protection. I was already ahead of the game compared to the people who had been working there for several years. My basis of knowledge reached farther than their's. With that foundation, I have been able to walk up to most anything and using a little intuition, figure it out. <br /><br />This year, I was awarded Operations Technician of the Year, not to mention winning Ops Tech of the Quarter twice this year. This may sound like me tooting my own horn, but I'm not. Had I not taken that low paying position at the small time ISP, I would never have learned all I did. I am the top Unix admin out of two combat comm groups because of that job. (I know this because I went to the other one to teach them a few weeks ago.) <br /><br />So even though a job may only pay a little, the experience and the potential for growth may be worth so much more. It could be a stepping stone into the admin business that so desperately wants experienced admins.</div>
