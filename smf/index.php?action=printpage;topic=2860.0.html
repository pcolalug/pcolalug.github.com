					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Nintendo&#039;s new console codenamed Revolution finally has an official name.&nbsp; It&#039;s called Nintendo Wii (pronounced &quot;we&quot;).&nbsp; Anyone else think this is the dumbest move Nintendo has ever made?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Dumbest move they&#039;ve ever made? No. <br /><br />(http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8e/Virtual_Boy_kit.jpg)<br /><br />The Nintendo Virtual Boy (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Boy) was the dumbest move they ever made.<br /><br />It&#039;s just a name. I mean, Xbox360 is a dumb name if you ask me. Why 360? It&#039;s not circular. It&#039;s not the 360th version. It is just a name. Game titles and quality are going to determine the sales.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I agree that this is not the dumbest move Nintendo has ever made. Nintendo has always been my console of choice and I agree that the name is stupid, but unless you are worried about people thinking you are kiddie because of the console you play, you will pick the console that has the games that you enjoy playing. Nintendo has never failed to make the best games in my opinion. Assuming that the new controller isn&#039;t a total flop, Nintendo continues to make great games, and that the Wii will be cheap(much cheaper than either the 360 or Playstation), then I don&#039;t think most people will care about the retarded name.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">While I agree the games are important, the name does play a part. To me, Nintendo has struggled in a good naming convention. NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, Game Cube and now Wii. Even though it is boring, at least Sony has at least stayed consistant with the PlayStation line. Though, they can be confusing too with the abbreviations: PlayStation (PSX), PlayStation One (PS1), PlayStation 2, PlayStation Two (PS2), PlayStation 3.<br /><br />But, the game console is all about the games. Like computers, you buy the one that runs the software you want to use. For me, Sony has me in their back pocket with the backwards compatability between PSX/PS1 and PlayStation 2/PS2. I did not buy my PSX until PlayStation 2 was already on the market. But I bought knowing that I would be able to continue to use my games from the original to the next generation of the console.<br /><br />But yeah, Wii is a pretty stupid name. I think they ought to stick with the name Revolution. That is a good name and with MS choosing 360 as their console name, maybe Nintendo can use the similarity (of meaning) to their favor. They did have the name first. Though, it would probably always be looked at as Nintendo trying to play catch up. Though they seem to be ambivilous to MS. They have their market and it is not the same as Sony and MS market.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">yeah, that was basically my point: the name Wii.&nbsp; Virtual Boy was Nintendo&#039;s worst venture i agree, but IMO, Revolution is a way better name than Wii.&nbsp; PS3 has a nice ring to it, and XBox360 just sounds cool.&nbsp; what does Wii actually mean anyway?&nbsp; i&#039;ll give &#039;em credit though.&nbsp; with a name like that, it will definitely get ppl&#039;s attention, whether it be positive or negative attention.&nbsp; of course if their new controller really will revolutionize gaming as they say it will, then i suppose the name won&#039;t really matter at all.</div>
