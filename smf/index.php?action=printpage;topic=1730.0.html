					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey Anybody out there interesting in starting a discussion on building your own wireless wan in the local area?<br />Would like to kick around the ideas pro's and con's, suggested ways to accomplish it and other associated topics.<br />I have been looking at it for a whil;e now and it is pretty easy to build a 2.4 gigahertz wireless good for about 10 miles.<br />Cons.....Need line of sight <br />Pros......10mps thru put.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have been reading where all over the country small communities have been building wireless networks to cover the entire area free to all.<br />My goals would to be draw out all the needed plans to do the same thing to the pensacola area. Pensacola is only 8 miles by 12 miles 16 miles if you count ensley. Would be interesting to have pensacola be the first city on the gulf to have an open wireless network...Initially I would want to set up for just the members of the group, But just think of the possibilities.<br />What would it look like...A freee and open wireless network stretching from Milton to Ensley and perhaps gulf shores!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">When you say line of site required, would you be looking at mounting antenna's on cell towers / building roofs?<br /><br />If it's doable I'll look into getting Gulf Breeze setup, should be able to get it sponsored by some companies, maybe Chamber of Commerce to get clearances for mounting hardware, and mediacom or bellsouth to provide bandwidth? <br /><br />Interesting idea if it can be done, let me know what else you come up with &nbsp;;)<br /><br />Nick</div>

					Post by: <b></b> on <b>June 27, 2004, 01:04:20 pm</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm going to play devil's advocate here. There are a massive amount of hurdles to overcome for a project like this. First you can't use a modified antenna that gives you coverage like that or the FCC will not be pleased, so that leaves using something FCC approved and already available for the purpose, that is going to be expensive.<br /><br />Second, one antenna and access point won't possibly be able to service all the people who would want to use such a service. Even though there aren't a huge number of technically inclined people in this area, say for example you have 10,000 people who want to use the network, that number far exceeds what a single access point is capable of handling. So then you need to find proper sites for setting up these antennas, that is a huge problem in itself and probably means you will need to ask cell companies or other radio related companies for permission to use their towers (You can bet they have the good spots or at least know where they are)<br /><br />Third, you would need the support of the various counties that the network would be available to. Getting more than one county to agree to something becomes exponentially difficult. This doesn't even consider the various clearances and other legalities that would have to be taken care of. Considering the greater community probably has a higher number of technophobes than computer geeks/nerds/enthusiasts I have a hard time believing that such a proposal would last very long.<br /><br />Fourth, if the idea of free internet is also a consideration that brings a whole new world of hurdles and issues to contend with, not the least of which is who will provide the bandwidth? Surely it would have to be a company, and probably an ISP. But whichever company steps up for that job has to contend with a network that would be very much like the wild west...No way to police it and thus cover their own legal liabilities. That is a situation that would be a nightmare for even users of the network. Who knows what sort of virus could be let loose or other malicious activity would happen? There's not really a way for average users to protect against that. Some kid could spend his afternoons trying to break in to any computer that is connected to the network. Yes these are all issues that exist in any other environment, but they are also all issues that will be raised when proposing such an idea to anyone.<br /><br />This is a long-winded post and I've only covered the tip of the iceburg. I personally think it is a great idea, but I'm convinced that it will take blood, sweat, and tears to make it happen, at least in any way outside of under the table.<br /><br />This is my first post, I've been to several of the meetings, just that I've been too lazy to register until now.<br /><br />Also this is the second time I've typed this post, konqueror died horribly on me when I tried to post the first time. That's the first time It's ever lost something I've worked on and it was irritating, but it's still my preferred browser. One time in several years isn't a bad record.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Shouldn't use Krappy software :)<br /><br />I wonder who would be able to provide bandwidth for something like this. &nbsp;One of the ISPs would be a natural choice - but they might not be ready to provide free internet access for everyone when they make their profits by selling it to the same people now. <br /><br />But we are just talking about bandwidth to browse the web / email / instant message so 10kps per user might be fine. <br /><br />Make it fast enough for people to use, but too slow to want to use it for downloading stuff.<br /><br />Hey bhoff could you provide some details on the equipment? &nbsp;Assuming it's not expensive I could setup a spot at my house to try out, I think a 10 or 20 foot pole off my chimney and I could have an antenna clear all the treetops on this side of the bridge. &nbsp;Only thing that scares me is that'd basically be a prime lightning rod :(<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It's a little different but a while back I read something about MIT putting up a large wireless mesh network which is basically what brett was talking about as far as getting a large area covered by wireless but if i'm not mistaken they ran 5.3ghz or 5.8ghz because it wasn't the common 900mhz, 2.4ghz, 5.0ghz used by normal home equipment(2.4ghz being probaly the more common for small wireless lans)....but their situation was slightly different since majority of the mesh network was on the school's campus, but not sure if it spanned outside of the campus and what kind of different laws they had in their situation<br /><br />if someone wants to research about it though, please do cuz I can't seem to remember where I read that information. also I've seen like 24dBi and such wireless mesh antennas for fairly cheap, they are basically wire parabolic dishes...add some amps and get the setup right and you can cover a broad area with them, but you run into FCC issues with amps &nbsp;:roll:</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Wow this is a lot of interest........<br />Right now this is just at the talking and planning phase.<br />I have found plans where you could use readily avalible materials and build your own dish and transciever..Very Cheap!<br />THey author is getting 12 plus miles on it will post web site here soon as I can grab it.<br />Yes there is numerous problems with making this fly..That is why I started a dscussion on it so I could see beyond my own scope. What I would propose initially is an intranet for the Members....Imagine having quick access to shared directories amongst our diffrent members. Suppose your Internet connection goes out using the Intranet you could ride on someone Else's connection to the outside world. Also point to point is not the only option. There is also Shortwave setup's I have seen to but not to fast on the bandwidth.<br />I am now putting together all the notes I have found on making this work and putting them together for your viewing pleasure.<br /><br />Note : what got me thinking about this is out at the Landfill we built and put up a wireless lan connection for them working fine at 2 miles with 2.4 ghz using a soup can for the directional plane.<br />Also we just finish setting up Okaloosa schools wiht some gear that is working over 18 miles line of sight no problem.<br />The only expensive part was the transciever.....</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Alright after reading my post maybe some of you concluded that I am building this as we speak. THat is not the case!<br />It takes months even years to get something like this just thru the planning phases. You have to find sites, Map geometetry, build test gear, so on and so on.<br />All I am doing at this point is talking taking notes from these discussions and incorporating them into my notes. I do have basic equipment plans and if person's are interested I can email tehm to them, But please remember this is just a Discussion.</div>
