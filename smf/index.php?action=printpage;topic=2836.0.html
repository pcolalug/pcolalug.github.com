					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey guys.<br /><br />A long while ago, me and patrick recorded a video of us trying to get to the top of this level in halo.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7831065241074189945&amp;q=halo+jump&amp;pl=true<br /><br />It was funny, we split the output cable so that it would go both to the tv, and to the pc in my room.&nbsp; We then ssh&#039;d into the pvr box to keep from having to go back and forth to start/stop recording it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, we took some clips from it, and encoded them with ffmpeg, then used avidemux2 to splice them together.&nbsp; Today I finally got done uploading it to google video so everyone could see it.&nbsp; It&#039;s not nearly as high res as the original, but it will do.<br /><br />So there you have it.&nbsp; Video captured, encoded, edited and submited all from linux.&nbsp; If anyone knows how to use this program to add a soundtrack and subs, it would definately be appreciated</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">By the way, do any of you know why gnome mutes the sound from google video and youtube?&nbsp; I tried it in xfce and it worked fine.&nbsp; I have a sneaking suspicion that its something to do with gnome&#039;s sound daemon (never been a fan of sound daemons for kde or gnome).&nbsp; I should note that all other programs play sounds just fine in gnome, with the exception of bmpx, which completely mutes my sound (and I can&#039;t unmute it).&nbsp; I also don&#039;t dare adjust the volume with gnome&#039;s volume control, as anything but its current setting will mute sound.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Interesting video. I loved the part about getting smashed by the jeep after blowing it up. :)<br /><br />I am not sure about the sound issues. On my machine (Mandriva/KDE) I always have to turn the sound way up to listen to the videos. It could also be the browser plug in. Try another browser to test the sound issue.</div>
