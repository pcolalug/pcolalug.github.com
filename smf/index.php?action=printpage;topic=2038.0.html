					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I finally have the NMCI experience. &nbsp;1 Hour (actually 55 minutes) on the phone to get my account on the PC activated. &nbsp;These cheap Dell's have 256mb of ram (2 x 128mb sticks taking the only 2 ram slots in the machine).<br /><br />The monitor is a non-trinitron dell, I guess 15 or 17&quot; maxed out at 1024x768. &nbsp;I'm used to 1600x1200, hopefully I can put the nmci box on my legacy monitor and crank it back up.<br /><br />And our development software isn't NMCI certified. &nbsp;So I don't know exactly what that means. &nbsp;Can I load our dev software on the dev-side of the NMCI box anyway? &nbsp;Or am I stuck coding in Notepad?<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hope you held on to your old box, imnes. There's no frickin way you can do any sort of J2EE development on such a pathetic machine. Love the forethought and planning that goes into these stupid desktop management fiascoes...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Not to mention that you don't have &quot;administrator rights&quot; to install ANY software whatsoever... &nbsp;NMCI has been a very painful experience around these parts.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well we do have admin rights on the box, so we can install anything we want. &nbsp;But we're supposed to stay within NMCI regulations, and if we do anything to circumvent security / procedures I guess we get sent to the principles office.</div>

Going to say hello to the Unisys folks Mon morning.<br /><br />Ahh, I didn't see sticker transference in the job descrip? :)<br /><br />By the way, what's traffic like getting there Monday morning. I'll be coming from Scenic.<br /><br />Peace.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Traffic is fine, once you get Downtown. Can't speak for the Scenic route, as I have to come from Milton. Though, if you don't get there fairly early (before 0730 or so), parking can be a problem in some areas around 603.<br /><br />So, are you the technician that's supposed to be visiting me between 2 and 4 Monday afternoon? If you could config that DMI machine to dual boot with SuSE or something, that'd be great.</div>

We're just the eyes &amp; hands on the ground, so just running pre-migration scripts to gather config info, then doing the data transfer. As far as the box setup, our masters are keeping it as config free as possible on our end. &nbsp;:)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Been scheduled to be switched 4 times now and denied all 4 times. Experiences from coworkers are a mixed bag, but frustrations, as expected, abound. Folks in my office haven't had too many problems of late, though.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">603, and its really just an old Penguin Computing advert cut out and taped to my desktop. Found out yesterday that they had me on the books as having been switched (which I haven't) and didn't know where my original paperwork is.</div>
