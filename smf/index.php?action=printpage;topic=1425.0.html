					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey guys,<br /><br />I have a bit of a delima on my hands. &nbsp;I have both the ati 9700 and the nvidia 5700 graphics cards, and I'm trying to figure out which one to sell and which to keep.<br /><br />My first hunch was to keep the 5700 because of it's better linux drivers, but then I read on toms hardware and the 9700 is usually a good 8fps faster in all the benchmarks. &nbsp;This leaves me wondering which one to choose. <br /><br />&nbsp;Note, I don't really care about an 8 fps difference right now but some time in the future it could make the difference between games being playible or not. &nbsp;The ati's rpm is a bit tricky to install under slackware, and winex doesn't support ati's cards that well atm.<br /><br />&nbsp;:? <br />Brent</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you plan on playing Half Life 2 when it is released, you may want to stick with the Radeon. There is something that HL2 does in it's rendering that make the Geforce series choke. NVidia says that new drivers will correct the problem, but it looks like the Radeon is going to own this game. This could of course have something to do with ATI and Valve's partnership on this game.<br /><br />Some info here (http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,3973,1264301,00.asp) and here (http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,3973,1265063,00.asp).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don't think 8fps will ever make the difference on whether a game is playable or not. &nbsp;If it does, that means it will still be right on the edge of unplayable and you'd want something better anyway.<br /><br />I'd stick with the nVidia. &nbsp;The newsgroups are FULL of people's problems with ATI cards and Linux. &nbsp;It's a no-brainer.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Features-wise, I would probably make the switch to ATI. &nbsp;In the desktops we have seen an incredible increase in reliability under Windows &amp; Mac. &nbsp;My friend at Red Hat is extremely hot over hte ATI devices right now because the community support has ramped up, but I also thought they were doing their own binary driver.<br /><br />On the other hand, I am extremely happy with my stock Xandros 2.0 running an included nVidia binary driver. &nbsp;(Nice touch.) &nbsp;UT2004 and Enemy Territory both came up fine and well, just worked.<br /><br />The reason I would make the switch is because I am mostly in Windows on my desktop as it is a shared family desktop and I have games buried where my 3 year old can't play them. &nbsp;&quot;No son, no gibbing today.&quot; &nbsp;Anyways, the reviews keep saying that support is kicking butt for the ATI product and my pal at RH has convinced me to make the leap of faith.<br /><br />I would say that if you are willing to put up with potential delays or issues in favor of raw performance, go ATI. &nbsp;If you want stability and just the usual desktop that just works, forego the 8fps and stay with the nVidia.<br /><br />Good luck, sounds like a touch decision.</div>

By the way, the reason I chose the Radeon 9800 Pro for my next system is for what looks to be significant performance advantages over the GeforceFX series in DirectX 9 games. OpenGL should be comparable, so for RTCW, ET and Q3, you should be fine with either one. <br /><br />Since I primarily game under Windows and that is what will be running on that system probably 80% of the time, the Radeon, from a price/performance standpoint makes more sense. <br /><br />Since you already have both, I would look at how these two cards are expected to perform with what you plan to play in the next 6 months or year. It all depends on what you plan to use it for.</div>

Most of the stuff I have been able to find has been very opinionated and not scientific.<br /><br />I have never owned a really nice video card until now. It is an nVidia Ti4200. I am very pleased with the driver that nVidia has supplied. I realize that there are arguments about whether it should be OSS or not. Personally I don't care as long as it works. Not being a coder, open source is the same as closed binary to me.<br /><br />I have read quite a bit about the promised features of upcoming drivers for ATI. But I have also read/heard for the last 7 years about how that &quot;next year&quot; Linux will take over the desktop world. I will believe it when I see it.<br /><br />Another appealing thing to me about nVidia is that they support older cards under Linux as well (not all features, but at least useable). I had a Radeon card (forget the number right off). It was a 32 Mb 3D card manufactured in 2000. I could not get it to do any 3D stuff nor could I get the TV out working. With my nVidia card (16 Mb 3D manufactured in 1997) I had full support from nVidia except for the TV out. But there is another driver that covered that for me.<br /><br />I realize that I did not have full support from either manufacturer, but I got more out of nVidia and then was able to find an add on driver for my TV out.<br /><br />At the moment, nVidia has me wrapped around their little finger. It would take a lot of work to convince me that ATI was better.<br /><br />So there is one more opinion, but still no benchmarks.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">ATI v nVidia (non-Linux specific):<br />http://www.clanbase.com/finger_cache.php?plan=johnc,John+Carmack<br /><br />A friend and I had an IM chat arguing ATI v. nVidia this morning. &nbsp;Here are some highlights:<br /><br />friend: with my NVidia on BZFlag @1024x768 I was getting 100-200 FPS. With the ATI I get about 65-90<br />friend: the reason the NVidia performs better is because they take hardware shortcuts in the binary-only driver<br />friend: OTOH, the binary -only driver produces a kernel that is unsupportable<br />friend: ask any kernel engineer<br />friend: some is off th4e cuff, some is SOP from working with the kernel team<br />friend: &quot;My kernel paniced with the NVidia driver loaded&quot; &quot;We can't debug the NVidia driver, call them&quot;<br /><br /><br />To which I am going to caveat this. &nbsp;I have been diehard nVidia for close to five years because of its reputation for rock hard stability under Linux. &nbsp;I have just not seen the issues he talks about. &nbsp;I suspect from prior postings that the majority of the group will maintain the same observation. &nbsp;I suggested to him that someone should do a benchmark between the two cards.<br /><br />friend: we aren't going to load the NVidia modules for a benchmark, because they taint the kernels<br /><br />Frankly, I could truly care less about tainting the kernels. &nbsp;Since I have stopped coding nearly 8 years ago, source code v. binary discussions are meaningless to me now. &nbsp;It is nice to have, but plays a very minor decision in what I choose for my hardware and or software.<br /><br />Would this constitute an interesting project? &nbsp;Perhaps the group could submit something like:<br /><br />Distributions<br />Kernel (stock v. compiled and version)<br />CPU<br />Memory<br />Motherboard?<br />Video Card (model, PCI v AGP, and memory configuration)<br /><br />Then perhaps the numbers for UT, UT 2003, UT2004, or Quake 3? &nbsp;Or both since Q3's framerate tends to be card bound and UT tends to be CPU bound.<br /><br />Have a good morning.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Guess I'll throw in my 2 as well. Based on what I'm hearing, I'd tend to stay with the NVidia card if Linux support is important to you. Though, as mentioned earlier, ATI is getting better supported via the community, I'd stay with a known performer for now. Maybe the next-gen cards will see me move to ATI, but that will be completely predicated on their Linux driver support. If I can't get the performance (2D/3D accel) from an ATI driver with the same ease I do with the NVidia drivers, I'll pass.<br /><br />BTW, thanks, Scott for all the good input. Sometimes its easy to forget that there are still people dual-booting out there :wink:.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I guess having started this discussion I should add something. &nbsp;From the posts I've read installing ati modules for slackware is a PITA. &nbsp;I'll be short.<br /><br />It involves alot of module compiling, modprobing, XFconfiging, etc.<br /><br />That makes the decision for me. &nbsp;I want a proffessional driver install, not some hack job to outfox the rpm deps.</div>
