					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Are runlevels similar to booting to &quot;safe mode&quot; in Windows?<br /><br />How do I find out which runlevel I am currently in? I know that my Mandrake system with X runs at runlevel 5. My Zaurus runs at runlevel 5 and 3 for the GUI, depending on whether you need a particular tool running. (But I cannot remember what it is). <br /><br />Could you set up runlevels to be able to boot the machine with only a certain set of programs/apps available? How many different runlevels are avialable? I have only heard of 1-6.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yes and no. Runlevels define a set of functions and services. When you boot, say into runlevel 2, that's typically &quot;single user&quot; mode, which means just enough stuff is running to call it a computer. Runlevel 3 brings in the networking services and typically any servers are started up. Not sure about runlevel 4. Runlevel 5 typically includes windowing services (X and the like). Runlevel 6 is reboot while runlevel 0 is shutdown.<br /><br />You can think of runlevels as &quot;stages&quot; in the boot process. Only with the Unicies, you have more fine grain control over what services get started when.<br /><br />A tip. You can change run levels from the command line with the <div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">telinit</div> command. See your fine man pages for details.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Actually, rburt3, runlevels are a little more distro dependent. Not all distros use the same scheme for their services...but otherwise, yes, you are correct. &nbsp;:P</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have been told recently by one of our Cali members that there are actually 10 run levels but usaully only 1-5 are used.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you look at the file /etc/inittab it will describe the runlevels used on your system, for mine this is (I'm just including part of it):<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"><br /># These are the default runlevels in Slackware&#58;<br /># &nbsp; 0 = halt<br /># &nbsp; 1 = single user mode<br /># &nbsp; 2 = unused &#40;but configured the same as runlevel 3&#41;<br /># &nbsp; 3 = multiuser mode &#40;default Slackware runlevel&#41;<br /># &nbsp; 4 = X11 with KDM/GDM/XDM &#40;session managers&#41;<br /># &nbsp; 5 = unused &#40;but configured the same as runlevel 3&#41;<br /># &nbsp; 6 = reboot<br /><br /># Default runlevel. &#40;Do not set to 0 or 6&#41;<br />id&#58;3&#58;initdefault&#58;<br /></div><br /><br />So if I were to edit that file, and change that last line to id:4:initdefault: my computer would boot straight into X Windows.</div>
