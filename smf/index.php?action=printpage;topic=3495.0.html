					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi everyone. My name is Shawn and finally got my login name to work. I am of course a huge geek, i work at a computer repair shop, love learning about computers, working on them, reading about them, and am in school for them. I go to UWF under the IET program. I currently use the slackware on one of my computers and an older computer running freebsd. I don&#039;t know that much about linux, but want to learn more.<br /><br />You may have seen me at the latest LUG meeting, and I look foward to going to more.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I work at tech advanced computers right now, hopefully I will stay until I finish college. I have also worked at gulf coast computers and 911 computer medics(worst computer place in town). <br /><br />But of course I never really get any linux machines at the shop. I have been there for about 8 months and I&#039;ve had one unix machine, it was for McDonalds. I just mirrored the failed harddrive to a new one.<br /><br />But man do I like fixing computers, of course MS making such a defective product that always breaks, and the average click happy user make sure I got a secure job.</div>
