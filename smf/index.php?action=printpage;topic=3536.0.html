					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Interesting article.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to comment on a few of the Starter Edition&#039;s &quot;features&quot;.<br /><br />*&nbsp; No Aero Glass, meaning you can only use the “Windows Basic” or other opaque themes. It also means you do not get Taskbar Previews or Aero Peek.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Makes some sense.&nbsp; Home Basic didn&#039;t have Aero, and people seem to want XP, which didn&#039;t have Taskbar Previews or Aero Peek.&nbsp; Give them what they want?<br /><br />&nbsp;* No Personalization features for changing desktop backgrounds, window colors, or sound schemes.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; This just seems silly.&nbsp; I highly doubt this will be in the final release.<br /><br />* No Multi-monitor support.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Looks like linux will be running on those dual-screened netbooks!<br /><br />* No DVD playback.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DVD is an outdated format.&nbsp; There will be however Blu-ray and HD-DVD support for your netbooks.<br /><br />* No <b>Windows Media Center</b> for watching recorded TV or other media.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is supposed to be a <i>bad</i> thing?<br />.<br /><br />* XP Mode for those that want the ability to run older Windows XP programs on Windows 7.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No more Word Perfect 3, Netscape Navigator, or MS-DOS gaming for you!<br /><br /><br /><br />Though they say &quot;the Starter edition of Windows is designed for entry level PCs and available only in certain regions&quot;&nbsp; I highly doubt it&#039;s going to keep excluding some of those basic functions.&nbsp; Microsoft already got rid of the 3-app limit, I imagine they&#039;ll fix those things as well.&nbsp; Windows 7 when I tested it was rock-solid and a very enjoyable experience, and that was just the Beta.&nbsp; I hear better things about the RC1 that&#039;s out now and expect even better things from them in the future.<br /><br />If not, more linux marketshare!<br /><br />And as the article pretty much stated, Apple doesn&#039;t know how to make a &lt;$1000 computer.<br /></div>
