					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If Best Buy doesn't have me working, I'll bring some copies of the latest Mandrake (Or whatever they're called by then) CDs.<br /><br />I've got a 50/50 chance on working that day. If they schedule me to close I won't be there. Otherwise it should be no problem.<br /><br />I'll try to make some copies up before then and get them to bhoff if I can't make it.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Definately want to use Fedora over RH9, IMHO. I'll grab the latest iso's for Fedora and Knoppix a couple of days prior to the installfest and burn a few copies of each. I can also bring my rig to burn more as needed. It'd be a good idea if a few folks could bring machines with burners in case we need 'em.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Tim also has two machines setup to burn also if we need them.<br />I would suggest that we stick to justtwo distros right now.<br />Mandrake and Redhat.<br />Why is RedHat 9 no longer supported?<br />Also Tim is going to supply sodas and hotdogs.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I took a stab at a flyer for the Install Fest. &nbsp;I don't want to step on anyone's toes, but unless it gets out there, the turnout may not be what the group was hoping for...<br /><br />If I missed something, then please ignore this posting. :)<br /><br />http://www.geekrooms.com/installfest.pdf.gz<br /><br />If folks can make corrections or suggestions by tomorrow night, I can probably generate an update late tomorrow evening. &nbsp;This is a variation on one that I saw at http://chuug.org/propoganda/.<br /><br />Is there perhaps anything else I can do to help out? &nbsp;No promises, but I sure will try.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>
