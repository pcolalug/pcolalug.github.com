					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I heard in passing from another student that Microsoft is going to be buying out Macromedia. &nbsp;Anyone heard of this? &nbsp;Is it true? &nbsp;I'm sure any plans of a linux version would be lost in the move :( &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />I haven't had a chance to try and verify the news, maybe someone else can, I have class, I'll check back later.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I heard the rumor, but it hasn't been confirmed. This was an old rumor anyhow. Also, there is rumor than MS might start making Linux software, so even if they did get bought out, doesn't mean they wouldn't port their software to Linux. Also, a MS buy-out isn't always bad. It depends on the original company really. Sometimes, it can mean very little in terms of what we see as consumers. Nothing says if they get bought out, that we will have Microsoft Flash or Microsoft Dreamweaver. They already have Frontpage anyhow.</div>
