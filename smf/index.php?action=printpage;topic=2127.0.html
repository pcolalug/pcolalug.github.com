					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay, it's been bugging me for awhile but now it's kind of important with my MX1000. &nbsp;I've been poking around in KDE and found the mouse settings for acceleration and such but can't seem to locate a catch-all &quot;sensitivity&quot; setting. &nbsp;Is there one or do I need to continue playing with these settings to hope for an optimal overall sensitivity?<br /><br /><br />Reason why is because I've turned acceleration all the way down to 1.0x and moved the pointer threshold up some (around 4) but it's still EXTREMELY sensitive. &nbsp;I'm talking you're in 1024x768 and you move the mouse roughly 1cm in order to traverse the entire screen. &nbsp;That's pretty [edit]darn[/edit] sensitive.<br /><br />Basically this new mouse is a LOT more sensitive to various changes in surface than an optical so I need to turn down a lot of my sensitivity settings in everything I use it with (still takes some getting used to in Doom 3 and HL2 but once you are [edit]DARN[/edit]...you can put the crosshairs on someone's left pupil at 100 meters with ease).<br /><br /><i>edited 10:11PM CST 12/20/2004 by Rugmonster due to profanity</i></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I haven't tried any of this, so can't say for sure that it works, but a quick Google search would seem to indicate you should check out the &quot;xset&quot; utility. &nbsp;&quot;man xset&quot; for more info...<br /><br />Also, perhaps check into the &quot;resolution&quot; keyword in your XF86Config (or xorg.conf) file...<br /><br />Google is your friend........... !</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Excellent suggestions, I'll check into it as soon as I get home.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay, there's no &quot;resolution&quot; in my XF86Config-4 file unfortunately but also this config file seems much more...spartan...than the xorg.conf I was using in Slackware.<br /><br />I checked into the &quot;m&quot; option for xset, basically the same thing that I've been messing with through the GUI in KDE. &nbsp;Oh well, maybe it'll just take more tuning.</div>
