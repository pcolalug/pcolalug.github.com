					Title: <b>FreeBSD Aims for Desktop</b><br />
					Post by: <b>rugmonster</b> on <b>May 13, 2006, 09:29:53 am</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">An article on ZDNet (http://news.com.com/FreeBSD+vows+to+compete+with+desktop+Linux/2100-1011_3-6071598.html?tag=nefd.top) with Scott Long of FreeBSD about their goals of reaching equal footing with Linux on the Desktop. In it, he talk *cough cough* complains *cough cough* of Gnome&#039;s gearing toward Linux development, as well as their goal to add a HAL to FreeBSD that supports hotplug devices.<br /><br />What do you think; should FreeBSD really be aiming at the Desktop, or should their focus remain the server and let the folks at PC BSD and that other one worry about the desktop? To me, FreeBSD is sort of a middle ground between Linux and OpenBSD, which seem to be on opposite sides of the spectrum of desktop usability and server/security focus. That&#039;s not to say that Linux doesn&#039;t make a great server, but OpenBSD certainly provides a secure, stable server platform while sacrificing on desktop usability.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">&quot;FreeBSD aims of Desktop ...and misses&quot;&nbsp; &gt;:D&nbsp; Sorry I couldn&#039;t resist.<br /><br />I might be wrong, but until I really get to know a distro, I judge it based upon my initial impressions on it.&nbsp; My desktop experiences with fbsd weren&#039;t exactly smooth sailing.&nbsp; Also, I really can&#039;t take it seriously until it gets current, timely java releases.&nbsp; If you do a broad range of software development these days, you had better have a current java SDK.&nbsp; <br /><br />On the server side, I&#039;ll admit fbsd does it&#039;s job fairly well.&nbsp; Then again, so does debian stable.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t recommend either for desktop use, but if you wanted a rock solid server setup, It wouldn&#039;t be a bad way to go.&nbsp; Some might recommend slackware.&nbsp; That&#039;s fine, if they&#039;re willing to do the extra work to maintain it.&nbsp; For me though, if I was a server admin, debian would be the way to go, as it would be the least work since they only update it once every 3 years or so.<br /><br />Of course obsd has it&#039;s place, but I&#039;m not sure how well it would handle special hosting needs...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Most of the people I&#039;ve spoken with who run FreeBSD on the desktop, claim it rocks.&nbsp; You can&#039;t let initial impressions run your life, man. :P&nbsp; There is a patchset available for the 1.5 JDK, and AFAIK, it runs pretty well.&nbsp; It just means you have to compile the JDK yourself (whee!)<br /><br />Debian also runs very nicely for a desktop machine, its derivatives, even more so.<br /><br />Ian<br /><br />P.S.<br />OpenBSD does *very* well for all my special hosting needs. xD</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have installed FreeBSD desktops based on versions&nbsp; 4.8, 4.9&nbsp; and 4.10.&nbsp; As a desktop it worked OK, although my recollection of it reminds me of Debian Stable for some reason, older packages, perhaps.&nbsp; Then I had nothing but problems trying to get the 5.x series to run, as I could never get X11 to work properly (I was missing an important post-install step: no .xinitrc file).&nbsp; Finally got 6.0 installed with X11 &amp; a KDE desktop, and sound to boot.&nbsp; It still reminds me of Debian or even Slackware but with a dependency-aware (sometimes) package management.&nbsp; FreeBSD tends to boot very quickly and it shuts down in a heartbeat,&nbsp; It also&nbsp; it seems to be very powerful, although that is just one of those gut impressions, that I couldn&#039;t back with an objective measurement if my life depended on it.<br /><br />Actually, PC-BSD really is FreeBSD with a slicker installer, which leaves one with X11 and sound fully configured &amp; other little niceties.&nbsp; Package installation is very easy with the .pbi system (as long as they work) and one can still use the traditional FreeBSD pkg_add and ports system.&nbsp; Be that as it may, for some reason, maybe because it was the first non-graphical install of any *nix I did that actually worked (or masochism?), I&#039;m really fond of the Old Red Mare, &amp; keep diddling with it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve downloaded install disks for FreeBSD 6.1 &amp; will probably dance with it some more later this month. </div>
