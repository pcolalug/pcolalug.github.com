					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Our July 2007 Meeting is forthcoming, so here is the obligatory announcement!<br /><br />This month I plan on getting us back on track, I have the next chapter complete for my series. It was originally going to be 2 short ones but merged them together and going to have one on spam next month to fill 2 tracking chapters. This months presentation is short so I put together a few other topics also for discussion.<br />I will have My new toy. The Nokia N770 with some cool tools loaded on it to show off and talk about, I will also have some handouts on adding 3rd party firmware to your wrt54g,wrt54gs and wrtsl54gs which are all immensely hackable. Will also have a quick tutorial on adding a sd memory card to your router to store more apps :) <br />All by way of the book I just bought by Larry and Paul of <span style="font-family: Verdana;">www.Pauldotcom.com</span> (http://www.Pauldotcom.com)..<br />And to finish up want to give update to earlier discussion in series on wireless mainly kismet and cool tools it comes with for gps &quot;gpsmap&quot; and the new fuzzy logic for detecting encryption type.<br />Sounds like a lot but wanted to hit on numerous subjects to get some participation back in.<br />Going to be fun and hope to see you there.<br /><br />#/Brett<br /><br />Also this month, we are considering doing a LAN Party, but are completely unsure of the interest level.&nbsp; I have put a poll in the General Discussion section for everyone to vote on.&nbsp; If we get 5-10 or more people interested in gaming that day, then we will try to LAN, otherwise, it will be a typical meeting.<br />Please cast your vote! (http://www.pcolalug.org/smf/index.php?topic=3191.0)<br /><br />Once the decision is made, I will reply to this post with the meeting details.<br /><br />Ian</div>
