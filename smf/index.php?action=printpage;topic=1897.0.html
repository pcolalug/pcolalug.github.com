					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Granted it's got a wait but I just found this, too:<br /><br />http://www.fileplanet.com/files/140000/146378.shtml<br /><br />Oh, lloydr, I'm glad you're here. &nbsp;Is there a 64-bit version of Slackware (see my gaming rig post for reason)?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hmm, something tells me I'm going to need to start up another thread asking about how to get 64-bit Linux up and running since I'm not entirely in understanding.<br /><br />I mean, the Linux kernel supports 64-bit, so what makes a 64-bit distro. a, well, 64-bit distro? &nbsp;What's different? &nbsp;What's better? &nbsp;What's worse? &nbsp;Can it still run the 32-bit stuff since I've got a Athlon64 coming which supports 32bit still?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It took a little work but I got it up and running on Linux. &nbsp;Most interesting was the lack of &quot;installation&quot; really. &nbsp;I mean, you just copy the pak files into base, boot it up, and only input your CD key on multiplayer. &nbsp;Otherwise I seem to be having some strangeness regarding framerate but I'm betting my system isn't optimized yet.</div>
