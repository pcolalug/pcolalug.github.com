					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Interesting.&nbsp; Has anyone here used ext4?&nbsp; I&#039;m hesitant about the upgrade.&nbsp; 9.04 so far for me has been a disapointment, as it lags something awful.&nbsp; :[</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am running ext4, but can&#039;t say good or bad about it yet.<br /><br />I remember there was great amounts of discussion back in the day about moving from ext2 to ext3 or reiserFS. I have not really seen much about why ext4 is supposedly better. I guess this is just one of those areas I trust the Ubuntu guys on. Other than running as root, they seem to have made conservative choices in the past.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I read this article today that talked about the virtues of ext4 and why it is better. It does not cover all the different FS out there, but it does explain what is different between the ext, ext2, ext3 and ext4 FS are.<br /><br />http://www.linux-mag.com/id/7271</div>
