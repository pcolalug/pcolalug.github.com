					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Penetration Tester&#039;s<br />Open Source Toolkit<br /><br />Syngress <br />ISBN 1-59749-021-0<br /><br />Well finally the first book I have run across that is a must read!<br />If you administer a network or even a single server, <br />Heck even for your own protection.<br />This is the one shop stop for learning how to hack successfully!<br />Anybody with a computer could read this book and tear up your network.<br />The book is well put together and walks you thru step by step. I read it and was shaking at the implications for the security field, And even more it gives you a live distro CD with all the hacker tools on it......<br />Yes I know we have to know how they did it to defend against it, But this book just opened up a whole can kick butt!<br /><br />I was glued to every chapter and even went as far to try the wifi attack with great success on my own network that I felt was atleast moderatly safe.<br /><br />Get it today before it is to late<br /><br />Posted to O&#039;reilly<br />http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/user/view/cs_msg/85561</div>
