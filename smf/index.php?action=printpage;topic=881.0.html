					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">OK. &nbsp;I noticed there is a listing of what's in the library on the web. &nbsp;I am not offering all of my books to the library pool. &nbsp;I have a decent collection I believe, but how does one either add their book to the library, where does the library reside. &nbsp;If a book is loaned to the library what happens if that person leaves the group? OR are all the books bought with funds of some such sort and they are the groups Just some questions.<br /><br />/lance</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">My understanding of the library is this:<br /><br />There are books that belong to the group (those registered to user 'librarian' in the library system). &nbsp;danc is in charge of those, and holds them in his possesion on behalf of the group.<br /><br />The other books (those registered to anyone else other than 'librarian') are owned by that person. &nbsp; The whole system works on a lending-library concept -- the books still belong to (and reside with) whoever owns them, since they are merely offering to make them available.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If that is true that would rock, I have many books that I don't look through much anymore, some are advanced some are not, some are classwork material for certification classes. &nbsp;I will be there after august 4th definitly, and will try to attend the following meeting.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That is the way it works. Good description crowe.<br /><br />I am sure danc can clear this up, but the only way that you used to be able to get a library account was to attend a meeting. This was to eliminate someone coming in that no one knew, just to rip off all our books.<br /><br />dpeach</div>
