					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Howdy Rick! One of our members is currently employed by Google. I think most of us are currently employed, but we do have several folks close to finishing school and may be interested. I, for one, would love to work for Google, but have two more years on my time with the Air Force and lack a degree, which I&#039;m sure you guys require. Thanks for stopping by and hope to hear from you again!</div>
