					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It's not Linux, but it's still worth mentioning that FreeBSD 4.7 was released (http://www.freebsd.org/releases/4.7R/announce.html) today.<br /><br />-Charles</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">No, definately not Linux, but SUPER sweet! OpenBSD (http://www.openbsd.org) 3.2 is also available for pre-order and should be generally available on Nov. 1st. &nbsp;Anyone want to get together and throw in a few bucks for a copy? &nbsp;I also have OpenBSD 3.1 if anyone is interested in borrowing it. I cannot make copies and distribute them because the CD format is copyrighted, but I can loan you my purchased copy so that you can install and play around.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just got 4.7 installed. &nbsp;<br /><br />I'm surprised actually, all my new hardware works fine, even the sound card (which is not working under latest versions of Linux).<br /><br />NVidia GeForce 3 Ti 500 video card is working great with the official NVidia drivers. &nbsp;(Typo in the manual, if anyone is trying to install these drivers you should update the driver line in your XF86Config files to read 'nvidia' not 'nv'.)<br /><br />I'm running WindowMaker right now, I still need to finish configuring things, but I like it so far. &nbsp;Using a file manager I stumbled across in the ports collection called &quot;Endeavour&quot; which is nice.<br /><br />Here's my current desktop in it. &nbsp;http://www.homeweb.org/~imnes/freebsd47windowmakerss1.png<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here's Endeavor in default setup. &nbsp;I haven't configured anything (not sure what you can configure yet, I've just used it as-is). &nbsp;<br /><br />Viewing a file with it's built-in viewer, in Hex mode. &nbsp;<br /><br />There's nice features such as: The device icons on the menu bar, click them to mount / unmount those devices.<br /><br />Also features a recycle bin, when you 'recycle' files they go to ~/.endeavor/username-recycle-bin/ or something like that, you can restore them from there if you like in the future, or delete them for good.<br /><br />I think you can go through and configure the programs you use to view all different types of files, like videos, mp3's, graphics, pdf files, etc.<br /><br />Anyway, here's the screenshot.<br /><br />http://www.homeweb.org/~imnes/endeavor_hex_viewer_ss.png<br /><br />Nick</div>
