					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Man, that took them <i>forever</i> to fix. The site's been defaced since last night/early this morning, from what I could gather. I heard about it from /., for cryin' out loud. ./, the Register, and other sites have screenshots and/or backups of the other things that were hit (the redhat case part of their site was hit too).<br /><br />[edit 11.29.04.12.37]Um, I just checked, and its still there. You think that web-caches/proxies are still showing the bad site or did realloc() go back again?<br /><br />[edit 11.29.04.12.47]Ah. The devil's in the details...<br />http://www.sco.com<br /><br />vs.<br /><br />http://sco.com<br /><br />WTF?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Usually, DNS admins set the default entry to the webserver, but nothing says it has to be that way, so http://foo.com and http://www.foo.com can be two different web servers/sites.<br /><br />Two beers to the hack!! &nbsp; :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just amazing. The www.sco.com address is still showing the cracked image. :roll:<br /><br />Wonder if this cracker somehow &quot;fixed&quot; the dns? I dunno, but hear that kids? Its the sound of admins being sacked. Though I'm usually not one to go in for the tinfoil hats on /., some are speculating that SCO is actually responsable for this in order to gain sympathy with the public and the courts. Sounds pretty fetched to me, but these folks aren't exactly known for thier sound decisions...<br /><br />Oh, and nslookup on both sco.com and www.sco.com show the same ip address. This prolly doesn't mean anything (I don't know a whole lot about this interweb thingy), but maybe it does.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Maybe *.sco.com goes to one IP address that acts as a load balancer and passes you off internally to different servers?</div>
