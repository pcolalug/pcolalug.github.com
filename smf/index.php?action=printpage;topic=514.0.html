					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I found out about this list from Randall Burt where I work. To give you a little background about myself I have been writing software since CPM was the well known OS and MSDOS was a new thing. <br /><br />I have worked on all different types of platforms from the CRAY down to the PC. I really like the power of Unix/Linux platforms because you can do more with the tools that are available.<br /><br />Currently I am working with Oracle products as a TPO for the project at work because it pays the bills. I have been working with Oracle databases for 14 years and I prefer them on Unix/Linux platforms. My first real involvement with Unix/Linux was when I wrote a user interface in perl for a bunch of database that were to migrate from a VAX/VMS to a Sun. Since then I have been hooked always looking for an excuse to play around with Unix/Linux.<br /><br />I have been doing web design since 1995 seriously and it keeps me busy (it's been growing at an exponential rate :) ). I prefer Linux platforms since I can use my perl skills. &nbsp;:wink: and the tools are a lot cooler. I have been working in MySQL, and PHP and have found that the latter looks a lot like perl.<br /><br />I look forward to meeting everyone.<br /><br />Mark Richards</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome aboard! <br /><br />And why is it that any time you talk about Oracle, it is a solution?</div>
