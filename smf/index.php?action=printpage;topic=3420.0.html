There was some confusion a while back as to whether the available files were the real thing or a dumbed-down version suitable for &#039;export&#039;, though it came from somewhere in Europe originally, if memory serves.<br />I&#039;ve been using GPG for a while, and I just use the package that came with my distro.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been messing about with Linux for a few years, now, and while I don&#039;t consider myself a wizard by any account, I like to think of myself as somewhat experienced... but hunting down dependencies is still rather intimidating for me. I usually don&#039;t end up getting things working that way, so kudos for getting your app up and running.</div>
