					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey bhoff and mall0ry - thanks for the welcome - all of my family had already moved here over the years and, when my wife died, they began banging me pretty hard to move, so I jumped -- We liked Pensacola a lot on all our visits and we had planned on moving, eventually anyway - maybe to NOLA instead but I guess this is fine -- hope I can figure out how to make a living here&nbsp; :D heh heh - little different than Houston&nbsp; :o<br /><br />I use linux for servers -- originally used bsd but switched to linux when I began using rackshack (ev1) servers for online stuff. I&#039;m really just an old programmer - I usually write cross platform - it&#039;s been years and years since I did any X (just for example&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Anyway - looking forward to meeting folks at the next meeting!</div>
