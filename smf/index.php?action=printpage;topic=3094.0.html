					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">absolutely LOVE this distro, (nearly) everything that was lacking in 10.1 (the difficulties accessing support through Novell and the indecision as to exactly WHAT update scheme they were going to settle on are just a couple of that releases&#039; problems) is gone in this release. It even has a whole new &quot;Start Menu&quot;. The one thing it doesn&#039;t have (on my particular laptop) presently is sound...<br /><br />Now let me say that the ONLY distro I&#039;ve been able to coax sound out of so far has been Ubuntu/Kubuntu 6.06 and I&#039;ve installed Fedora 6, Debian Sarge AND Knoppix 5, ALL from DVDs(!). Any you guys who&#039;ve met me know that I&#039;m NOT a computer expert by any stretch of the imagination, I just HATE MS WIndows and would LOVE to retire it for good. I&#039;ve posed the problem to some of the other boards and have gotten no response so far, I&#039;ve googled it as well with no result.<br /><br />My laptop is a Gateway MX6214, The Northbridge is Intel&#039;s 945GM and the Southbridge is Intel&#039;s 82801GBM. The Windows audio is provided by SigmaTel 9250.<br /><br />My onboard WiFi (GemTek Technology Co. BCM4311E) doesn&#039;t work either, as well the card reader (Texas Instruments PCI-8412, I THINK!) or the modem (Silicon Laboratories Si3080) BUT this is all gravy if I can get the sound up and running. I&#039;m using a Proxim Orinioco Gold WiFi card (Atheros chipset) to connect to the web so that&#039;s no problem...<br /><br />Anyone interested in helping me out can reach me via Skype (LATE at night as mentat.assassin) or by my email (same name as Skype except at gmail.com). It may be a minute before I can get back to this forum...<br /><br />Thank you and have a good (and safe) holiday everyone.<br /><br />- Kell<br /></div>
