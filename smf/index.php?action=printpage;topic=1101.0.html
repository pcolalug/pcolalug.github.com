					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey guys...I mentioned in my introduction thread that I was going to go all Linux on my laptop...well I've done this a little ahead of schedule...I'll spare you the story and just pick your brains for a few things.<br /><br />I installed RedHat 9...<br /><br />I had apt-get and synaptic installed on the new install then I uninstalled them using rpm -e apt-* rpm -e synaptic.<br /><br />I still have the original apt rpm and decided I wanted to put apt back on but now I get this:<br /><br />root@localhost jody]# rpm -Uvh apt-0.5.5cnc6-fr1.i386.rpm<br />Preparing... ########################################### [100%]<br />file /etc/apt/rpmpriorities from install of apt-0.5.5cnc6-fr1 conflicts<br />with file from package atrpms-16-1.rh9.at<br />file /etc/apt/sources.list from install of apt-0.5.5cnc6-fr1 conflicts w<br />ith file from package atrpms-16-1.rh9.at<br />file /etc/apt/vendors.list from install of apt-0.5.5cnc6-fr1 conflicts w<br />ith file from package atrpms-16-1.rh9.at<br />file /usr/lib/apt/methods/bzip2 from install of apt-0.5.5cnc6-fr1 confli<br />cts with file from package libapt-pkg-0.5.5cnc6-35.rh9.at<br />file /usr/lib/apt/methods/cdrom from install of apt-0.5.5cnc6-fr1 confli<br />cts with file from package libapt-pkg-0.5.5cnc6-35.rh9.at<br />file /usr/lib/apt/methods/copy from install of apt-0.5.5cnc6-fr1 conflic<br />ts with file from package libapt-pkg-0.5.5cnc6-35.rh9.at<br />file /usr/lib/apt/methods/file from install of apt-0.5.5cnc6-fr1 conflic<br />ts with file from package libapt-pkg-0.5.5cnc6-35.rh9.at<br />file /usr/lib/apt/methods/ftp from install of apt-0.5.5cnc6-fr1 conflict<br />s with file from package libapt-pkg-0.5.5cnc6-35.rh9.at<br />file /usr/lib/apt/methods/gpg from install of apt-0.5.5cnc6-fr1 conflict<br />s with file from package libapt-pkg-0.5.5cnc6-35.rh9.at<br />file /usr/lib/apt/methods/gzip from install of apt-0.5.5cnc6-fr1 conflic<br />ts with file from package libapt-pkg-0.5.5cnc6-35.rh9.at<br />file /usr/lib/apt/methods/http from install of apt-0.5.5cnc6-fr1 conflic<br />ts with file from package libapt-pkg-0.5.5cnc6-35.rh9.at<br />file /usr/lib/apt/methods/rsh from install of apt-0.5.5cnc6-fr1 conflict<br />s with file from package libapt-pkg-0.5.5cnc6-35.rh9.at<br />file /usr/lib/apt/methods/ssh from install of apt-0.5.5cnc6-fr1 conflict<br />s with file from package libapt-pkg-0.5.5cnc6-35.rh9.at<br />file /usr/lib/libapt-pkg-libc6.3-5.so.0.0.0 from install of apt-0.5.5cnc<br />6-fr1 conflicts with file from package libapt-pkg-0.5.5cnc6-35.rh9.at<br /><br />I saw on linuxquestions.org that someone thought this meant that apt was still installed but when I do rpm -e apt-* it says apt package not installed.<br /><br />Does anyone know how to fix this?<br /><br />The second issue is, when I install icon themes using the Theme applet they don't show up on the list to choose the icons. &nbsp;I see them in my .theme folder in my home folder but I can't choose to use them from the theme applet. &nbsp;I had found a fix for this the first time around but now I can't find it again.<br /><br />I'ld really appreciate the help!!<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Jody</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You may be able to get around this by &quot;forcing&quot; the rpm to install (I forget what the rpm flag is ATM, but its prolly -f or -F). The errors indicate that apt may indeed be removed from your system, but the libraries that apt and other proggies use are still there (libapt, for example).<br /><br />As for your theme problems, are you using the default Gnome or some other desktop?</div>
