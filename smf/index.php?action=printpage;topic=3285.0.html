					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Happy New Year everyone.&nbsp; I decided to purchase the Nokia N800 as a Christmas present to myself.&nbsp; I have been tinkering with it for a few days now.&nbsp; I have to say I am impressed with what you can do with it.&nbsp; Its very flexible.<br /><br />The first think I did was install OS2008 which will hinder it for a little while while packages get ported from the earlier OS releases.&nbsp; But overall its pretty cool.&nbsp; It is amazing how good the connectivity is.&nbsp; The N800 finds and connects to wifi very fast and easy.&nbsp; When I do not have wifi available, I have the N800 tethered via bluetooth to my cell which has unlimited internet usage (at dialup speeds until 3G is available here), its pretty quick though.<br /><br />I have a Wintec bluetooth gps logger that connected without a hitch for use with maemo mapper.<br /><br />The N800 has a little vga webcam that I have not really used yet.&nbsp; I think at this time the only service that is setup to use it is the gizmo project.&nbsp; I did set up an account, so if anyone uses the gizmo project and would like to do a test let me know.<br /><br />I have used google talk and skype messengers with it (less video) and it works really well.<br /><br />Lee</div>
