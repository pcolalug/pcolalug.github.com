Open source business models often focus on<br />charging for support and customization. Is there an economic model that<br />can demonstrate the true worth of a piece of software and the option for<br />support, maintenance, and upgrades? Robert Lefkowitz argues that open<br />source exposes the true value of software itself as, essentially, worth<br />less in comparison to support and maintenance.<br />http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/07/21/software_pricing.html<br /><br /><br />***Learning Lab: Save 50% on the Open Source Programming Certificate<br />&nbsp;Series<br />Our Open Source Programming Certificate Series will teach you the core<br />technical skills necessary to fully understand programming using Linux<br />or Unix operating systems, languages, libraries, and databases.<br />Completion of this series also earns you a Certificate of Professional<br />Development through the University of Illinois Office of Continuing<br />Education. &nbsp;For two weeks only, save 50% on all Open Source Programing<br />Certificate Series classes.

Kevin Lo uses his for didactic purposes, but this<br />is a good example for taking your desktop or firewall along with you.<br />Here's how to build and customize an OpenBSD installation on a CD.<br /><br /><br />***The Virtual Referral: Mitigating Risk by Hiring Open Source<br />&nbsp;Developers <br />Hiring a new employee is almost always a risk, and hiring the wrong<br />employee can prove a costly mistake for managers. Brian Fitzpatrick<br />suggests you hire an open source programmer. Find out why doing so<br />mitigates the risks involved in hiring. Meet Brian at O'Reilly's Open<br />Source Convention, where he'll be leading a Subversion tutorial and a<br />session on switching from CVS to Subversion. <br />http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/07/14/osdevelopers.html<br /><br /><br />***PHP 5.1's Killer Features<br />Learn about PHP Data Objects, perhaps the greatest new feature in <br />PHP 5.1.<br />http://www.sitepoint.com/blog-post-view.php?id=274359<br /><br />---------------------<br />Mac<br />---------------------<br />***David Pogue Photos from our recent MUG event at the Stanford Linear<br />Accelerator Center:<br />http://www.flickr.com/photos/16228484@N00/sets/625100/<br /><br />http://www.flickr.com/photos/wdn2/sets/625173/<br />(Special Thanks to Don Nelson of DVMUG for sending these along.)<br /><br /><br />***Programming with Spotlight<br />The API for Spotlight offers highly advanced search capabilities.

The best way to end<br />struggles is to redefine the goals of the work so that their roles can<br />be collaborative, not adversarial. In this article, Scott Berkun draws<br />upon his years of project-leading experience to provide some inside tips<br />for managing your development team. Scott is the author of The Art of<br />Project Management.<br />http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2005/07/08/dev_team.html<br /><br />---------------------<br />Windows/.NET<br />---------------------<br />***Unit Testing in .NET Projects <br />Now is a pretty exciting time for unit testing in .NET.

In this article, Amir Shevat shows how the<br />open source JUnit extension Pisces helps JUnit overcome this limitation.<br />http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2005/07/13/pisces.html<br /><br /><br />***What Is Business Process Modeling? <br />Business Process Modeling (BPM) is a set of technologies and standards<br />for the design, execution, administration, and monitoring of business<br />processes.
