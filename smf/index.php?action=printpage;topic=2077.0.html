					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I was thinking about changing the runlevel in Slackware 10 to something graphical, like runlevel 5 just to reduce time to start up X (I'm always going into X anyway).<br /><br />However, at LILO when I test it out, nothing happens. &nbsp;I forget the file, maybe it's /etc/inittab, but changing it there didn't seem to have any effect either. &nbsp;If I boot into 5 it hangs at trying to start up X. &nbsp;4 does nothing. &nbsp;Am I doing something wrong?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"># These are the default runlevels in Slackware:<br /># &nbsp; 0 = halt<br /># &nbsp; 1 = single user mode<br /># &nbsp; 2 = unused (but configured the same as runlevel 3)<br /># &nbsp; 3 = multiuser mode (default Slackware runlevel)<br /># &nbsp; 4 = X11 with KDM/GDM/XDM (session managers)<br /># &nbsp; 5 = unused (but configured the same as runlevel 3)<br /># &nbsp; 6 = reboot<br /><br />I think u should be using 4....but i don't know what's going on with ur install...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That's what I changed to 4, but at the end of the startup it would say, &quot;starting X11,&quot; and then the screen would go blank, a minute or two later click back to the console, go blank, ad infinitum. &nbsp;Real weird.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">But that's the thing, typing startx works perfectly, X runs like a dream. &nbsp;Still need to fine tune the refresh rate 'cause I'm afraid if I mess with it I'll fry my monitor but yeah, it runs perfect.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay then maybe you're set to use one of the login managers not installed on your system. &nbsp;Are you running Gnome or KDE or something else?<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">As I've never heard of a login manager, that sounds very likely. &nbsp; :lol: <br /><br />I'm using KDE 3.2. &nbsp;I'd use Gnome but...I dunno, it's cool but I just don't use it as much as KDE. &nbsp;I'd like to upgrade to KDE3.3 but I'm finding it difficult to find information on just how to go about that, just complaints about things being broken in KDE 3.3.<br /><br /><br />But yeah, tell me all about these &quot;login managers.&quot; :twisted:</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Slackware I think defaults to XDM which should be included by default. &nbsp;Login text mode and type <br />xdm<br /><br />See if it starts a login screen. &nbsp;If it doesn't then that's your problem. &nbsp;If it doesn't work, try<br />kdm<br /><br />If that doesn't work,<br />gdm<br /><br />Let us know what happens / which works. &nbsp;Maybe we can get this problem sorted out.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay, I tried to run all three, xdm and so forth, and all of them told me that only root would want to run that. &nbsp;So I su root and ran /usr/X11R6/bin/xdm and while I got a login now my sound doesn't work (see Hardware Section).</div>
