					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey guys I have done 3 upgrades now and it worked great and only had one small glitch that I am going to explain.<br /><br />First I did upgrade via the update manager over the internet vs a disk.<br /><br />It took about 45 minutes on cox and 1.6ghz machine...<br />Afterwords my settings and all were good. I did mess up and upgraded my wireless manager to wicd instead of that default one in Ubuntu.<br />Now I could not connect to my AP. would not get dhcp lease.<br />a little digging found the culprit it was the /sbin/dhlient3 script it is protected by apparmor.<br />to fix this do the following from command line<br />sudo mv /etc/apparmor.d/sbin/dhclient3 /etc/apparmour.d/disable/<br /><br />that will take care of your little issue now reboot to make sure the security permissions are set for dhclient.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I did an upgrade through the CD from 8.10 to 9.04. I was already running the new KDE 4.2 on 8.10 of Kubuntu.<br /><br />The night of the last meeting when I did the upgrade my system was not stable. I thought maybe it had to do with just a first reboot quirk. Ended up, I could not keep the system running well and I never found out what was causing the lockups. Through a process of over a week I got my whole /home file into a current backup and did a full re-install from scratch on the 9.04. This time I chose the ext4 file system. It has been rock solid since.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that machine is being used as my wife&#039;s primary machine since hers was stolen last month. I have not had any chance to play with it. I also have not gotten wireless working on it yet. I must get that done before the weekend.<br /><br />I plan to do a fresh install on my desktop later this week which is running 8.04.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I had KDE 4.2 running on Kubuntu 8.10 and when I upgraded my laptop it became very unstable as well.&nbsp; I ended up backing up /home and reinstalling like you.&nbsp; My two Ubuntu 8.10 desktops went to 9.04 just fine.</div>
