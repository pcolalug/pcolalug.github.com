					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I finally managed to do it! &nbsp;I got gentoo to build on a 486/33SX w/ 20MB RAM.<br /><br />Of course, this did come at a cost, ie, besides having to leave the machine on for a week and half straight throughout the entire build, I also had to build a boot/root floppy for this specific machine. &nbsp;That proved a bit of a hassle mostly in the way of having to actually build the disk from scratch.. turns out that this specific machine was very non-standard and rather quirksome in many, many ways.<br /><br />But the end result was quite nice, given the crufty old box it's now running on. &nbsp;I had to forgo many of the things such as having a GUI, etc.<br /><br />And now why did I do this? Because I'm a very studly geek. &nbsp;Oh yes.</div>

It takes me at least 45 minutes on my K6/200 and over an hour when it was a 486DX4/100. My P3/550 takes around 20 minutes. You can only imagine how long X, GCC and Glibc took to compile!<br /><br />Compiling from source has its advantages, but man does it take time...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That is something else.<br />I have been using 486 machines forever from everything from routers and Print servers to Nodes for my cluster. I am happy to see someone else putting these machines to use. Let me know how it's going.<br /><br />Hey Steve don't put down them commodore 64's with cassette tape I had one and a small blk/wht tv to boot.<br />Brett</div>

That did not sound right. I don't think a kernel recompile should take 4 years. Let's try this....<br /><br />About 4 years ago, I started a kernel recompile, but chickened out when it asked me about the 200th question that I was totally clueless as to how to answer.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Maybe someone will beat me to the punch before I get down that way for a visit, but if not, when I come home, we can have a big ol' kernel recompile event (because stock kernels sux0r!!!). Some distributions likes Redhat and Mandrake like to include extra packages like supermount and premptible kernel and O(1) scheduler and such, but you can always download their source. It does take time to figure out what your kernel needs, but that is why you always keep a backup of your stock or last working kernel. I always try to keep up with the latest kernel and most times, I recompile my kernel to take out all module dependencies and cut the crap that I don't need (ie SMP on a single proc box). Maybe I can put together a presentation for the meeting I attend in July!!! Or an article!!! Or something...</div>
