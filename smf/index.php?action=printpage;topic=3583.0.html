					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You guys familiar with Nerd Invasion? I am not totally sure what it is myself, though I have looked at their website. But, they are asking if we could do a Linux Install Fest at their event in November. They are expecting around 500 participants that weekend.<br /><br />Here is the email I got from them.<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">Greetings,<br />My name is Jason King and I am one of the co-chairs of NERD INVASION, which is a Nerd music and Gaming Event being held November 6-7 at the Silver Screen in Pensacola.<br /><br />We have a lot of interest in holding a Linux install fest the morning of Saturday November 7th. Would this be something you guys are interested in helping out with? I think our attendance is going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 500.<br /><br />We&#039;ve got a lot of people coming in from around the country. And I thought it would be great to get the local lug involved.<br /><br />If you think you may be interested in helping out, let me know.<br /><br />Thank you so much for your time.<br /><br />www.NerdInvasion.com</div><br />Anyone up for this? I will be in Tennessee that weekend, but this would be a great project for the incoming Steering Committee to kick off their reign.<br /><br />Let&#039;s kick it around and see who can commit to helping with an install. Typically we have offered to install anything the user wanted as long as someone was willing to bring disks. However, we have also tried to stick to just 1 or 2 standard distros if the person doesn&#039;t really know what they want.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Greetings,<br /><br />I am the Jason King mentioned in the above post. I appreciate you guys talking about helping us out with an install fest. Nerd Invasion will be loaded down with participants that are ripe for making the switch. A lot of them run nix already, but there is a lot that just need a nudge and a good environment to get their feet wet. <br /><br />Wired.com is running a 3 part piece on us. The second part just dropped...<br /><br />http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2009/10/nerd-invasion-2/<br /><br />My goal is to have them talk up a linux install fest in the 3rd part. With the exposure the article has got and what pre-sales are already, I think we will probably be looking at close to 1000 participants at Nerd Invasion. Out of that pool, we could get a good amount setup with a brand new linux box. <br /><br />I am up for helping you guys promote your organization however I can. And if you have any ideas, feel free to contact me at jason@nerdrockstar.com<br /><br />Thanks so much.<br /><br />Jason<br />Nerd Invasion<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yes, I would most definitely be willing to help set up an install fest for Nerd Invasion!&nbsp; By then the new version of Ubuntu, 9.10, should be out, so good timing I guess.<br /><br />I heard about Nerd Invasion about a month ago and kind of shoved it to the back of my mind as a &quot;three people will probably show up&quot; event.&nbsp; Boy was I wrong!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think if we have 3 or 4 definitely committed, then we can confirm that we will be there. If there are more who can attend and help run this, all the better.<br /><br />With you three committed, can I tell Jason that we are definitely on?<br /><br />I will find out about the tickets.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That&#039;s awesome guys!<br /><br />I will announce that we will be spreading the gospel at Nerd Invasion.<br /><br />As to tickets to the event. Of course you guys don&#039;t have to pay to get in. <br /><br />However, all proceeds from the event do go to a good cause, so if you wanted to pay your way in to the convention, I could probably make you guys up some custom shirts or something. I do own a shirt company :-)<br />For your information to tell others, pre-sale tickets are available at Nerdinvasion.com online, and locally at TBS comics and Homefield cards and games. <br /><br />Thanks you guys so much. I think this will be a great event. Now off to get distro sponsorship!<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Jason<br /></div>
