					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok I found that Slackware 9.1 already had XFCE4 installed in it. &nbsp;I gotta say, if you're one of us (few) that like Gnome you'll really like xfce. &nbsp;Very clean look, very quick response. &nbsp;Uses the xffm file manager which is very capable.<br /><br />You can get a look at it here:<br />http://www.xfce.org/en/screenshots.html<br /><br />Be sure to check out developers and users screenshots as well.<br /><br />Out of the box it has no apps really. &nbsp;It has a link to mozilla web browser, mozilla mail client, xterm, and xffm file manager. &nbsp;(The file manager button has links to konqueror and nautilus too if you like). &nbsp;So basically you get a clean system and tailor it to suit your own needs. &nbsp;I removed the mail and nautilus link and added my own apps for internet, balsa mail client, epiphany browser, xchat, gaim, and kazaa. &nbsp;For office apps I put in the latest release of OpenOffice, and ggv for PDF's. &nbsp;For multimedia apps I put in gxine for videos, xmms for audio. &nbsp;For developer apps I have Kylix, JBuilder 9, and Anjuta. &nbsp;For games I have Unreal Tournament 2003, Enemy Territory, RedFaction, Medal of Honor Allied Assault, and Quake 3. &nbsp;And those are the only apps I have to look at, I don't have anything else cluttering up the place :)<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It's very KDE friendly too. &nbsp;You can map all your KDE programs into it and use konqueror to browse files, and it even has a KDE icon theme. &nbsp;<br /><br />One thing I did on mine to get some more screen space is set both the taskbar (up top of the screen) and the menu bar (bottom of the screen) to auto-hide, so I effectively have the whole screen left for apps which is nice. &nbsp; I'm one of those people who typically maximize my programs and only look at one at a time, I don't like to use things in little windows usually.<br /><br />Nick</div>
