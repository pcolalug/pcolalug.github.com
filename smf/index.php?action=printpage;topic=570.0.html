					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi all,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I was selected to receive a trial Safari book service subscription from O'Reilly, through our Linux User Group. &nbsp;I wanted to write a brief description of the service, and my impressions.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The service allows you to read (online) any of the over 1000 books that O'Reilly publishes. &nbsp;You can have up to 10 books on your &quot;bookshelf&quot; at any one time, and can read them in their entirety. &nbsp;The available books cover all kinds of computer topics, including Linux, Windows, programming, security, and much more. &nbsp;They are well categorized to help you find what you want. &nbsp;In addition, there is a GREAT search capability which allows you to search for keywords in ANY of the books.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;As a beginner with Linux, I concentrated on books of that nature, and found a large collection of help and information. &nbsp;I was able to learn a great deal on the topics that interested me, currently firewalls and Samba. &nbsp;As a result I have my home network integrated nicely with Linux and Windows, using Samba. &nbsp;Also I was able to configure a Linux machine as a router/gateway. &nbsp;While these may seem trivial topics to seasoned Linux users, they are very challenging to newcomers, and I know I couldn't have done it without the aid of the books I read here on Safari.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Overall I have been very pleased with the Safari service and would recommend it to both beginners and experts. &nbsp;In fact you can give it a try yourself, for free! &nbsp;There is a 14-day trial subscription (http://www.oreilly.com/safari/ug) available just for registering, and I'd recommend you check it out. &nbsp;The website is: &nbsp;http://safari.oreilly.com. &nbsp;Go see it, and I hope you get as much from it as I have. <br />Dan</div>
