					Title: <b>Book Review - The Complete FreeBSD</b><br />

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><i>The Complete FreeBSD: &nbsp;Documentation from the Source</i>, 4th ed. by Greg Lehey<br /><br />Don't let the title of this book deceive you! &nbsp;Firstly, &#8220;Complete&#8221; does NOT mean it is an exhaustive, highly-technical reference of the FreeBSD operating system, containing tons of printed man pages (as previous editions did). &nbsp;Rather, it provides a complete overview of FreeBSD, focusing on version 5 (many differences from FreeBSD 4.x are noted). &nbsp;Secondly, &#8220;from the Source&#8221; does not necessarily refer to the source code: &nbsp;the author is and has been part of the FreeBSD team for many years and has written the previous editions published by Walnut Creek.<br /><br />This book is a great guide showing both beginner (like myself) and experienced Unix users new to FreeBSD how to get the system up and running. &nbsp;It covers not only system administration tasks, but also the setup and configuration of nearly all of the popular ports&#8212;whether you're trying to set up a workstation or server (web, mail, file, print, firewall, etc.). &nbsp;For each program, the author gets you on your feet and points you in the right direction for more details. &nbsp;He doesn't dabble with the volatile details that might change three months later&#8212;I appreciated that. &nbsp;He also gives you recommendations and warnings along the way. &nbsp;I found the chapter on configuration files the most useful. &nbsp;If deciphering *.conf man files isn't exactly your cup of tea, this is for you. &nbsp;Lehey discusses over 50 configuration files and recommends whether you WILL need to change it, MIGHT need to change it, or SHOULD NOT change it. &nbsp;Everything a new FreeBSD 5 user needs is covered and explained in plain English.<br /><br />(Review also posted to O'Reilly and AllBookstores.com.)</div>
