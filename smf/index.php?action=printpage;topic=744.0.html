					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Now that I have a few more hours a week to play games, I thought it would be interesting to see what games other members are playing. As for me:<br /><br />.hack for PS2 (http://www.dothack.com/game/page/frameset.html) - a MMORPG that's neither online nor multiplayer. Took me a few dungeons to get into it, but the unique story and play dynamic has me hooked. Who'da thought I'd like RPG's!? d**n you Final Fantasy X. d**n you to hell.<br /><br />Enter the Matrix for PS2 (http://www.enterthematrixgame.com/) - can't get enough of that bullet time! Great action. Its like The Matrix Reloaded part 1.5.<br /><br />Return to Castle Wolfenstien Enemy Territory for Linux (http://games.activision.com/games/wolfenstein/index.asp?section=et) - still suck, nuff said.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've got a PS2 in the house, but have never really played much on it. &nbsp;My kids used to, but even they don't seem to much any more. &nbsp;<br /><br />On the PC, I am also playing ET some, and need to play more. &nbsp;I still play regular RTCW quite a bit. &nbsp;Every now and then I still play Quake3 and UT2003 online, although my skills are not so great in them. &nbsp;I'd say they are both harder to play well online than RTCW or ET. &nbsp;Things happen /much/ faster in those games.<br /><br />On the &quot;back-in-the-day&quot; side, I fondly remember playing a LOT of Duke Nukem 3D online (via a shareware program called Kali). &nbsp;Hard to beat that game in sheer gameplay enjoyment. &nbsp;Fast but simple. &nbsp;And of course before that I was a diehard Doom/Doom2/Quake/Quake2 player, mostly single player though. &nbsp;Quake2 is also hard to play well online.<br /><br />Sometime this year (?) they are supposed to release &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot; and &quot;Doom 3&quot; which are expected to be blockbuster hits. &nbsp;I will buy both of them the first day they hit the stores. &nbsp;Not sure if there will be native Linux versions of them though...<br /><br />Keep yer heads down, and shoot first.<br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have been playing Enter the Matrix on the PS2 quite a bit. I absolutely love it. On the PC front, I am playing RTCW and ET, but not enough, like danc said. Speaking of which, when are we going to try the distributed lan party again?</div>

We just got our PS2 this past Christmas and its great. Playing FPS's on it took a bit of getting used to. What we like is that there are games for the whole family: racers for the wife, RPG's/Action for me, and kid-friendly platformers for the kids (though they really liked Final Fantasy X alot!). Also, I can get to play a lot of games that I otherwise wouldn't now that we're a Linux household. BTW, rumor has it that with Sony's increasing investment in Linux for many of their developing products, the next PlayStation will run with some flavor of real-time embedded Linux!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: In regards to Duke Nukem Forever and Doom 3, danc</div><div class="quote">Not sure if there will be native Linux versions of them though...</div><br />John Carmak confirmed late last year that Doom 3 will indeed be available for Linux. I had heard that id, and Carmak in particular, do most of their development *on* Linux. That's why id's games almost always have a Linux version now. As for DNF, I'll be surprised if we even see a Windows version! ;).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: Finally, Rugmonster</div><div class="quote">Speaking of which, when are we going to try the distributed lan party again?</div><br />The plan is to have a formal LAN fest once a quarter. Impromptu meets on various servers via the web is incouraged in the inerim.</div>

Let me know. I know two gamers that would love to spend a few days with one (myself and my 5 year old).<br /><br />Currently I have been out of the game loop, but this is what I have been playing recently. <br /><br />Roller Coaster Tycoon<br />Unreal Tournament<br />Need for Speed Hot Pursuit<br />Command and Conquer-Red Alert<br />Lots of Lucky Charms (http://www.moomoosoft.com/) on the Zaurus.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Guess I'll pitch in on this list too...<br /><br />As of recently, I've been playing:<br /><br />Enemy Territory<br />Uplink<br />UT2k3<br /><br />And that's about it &nbsp;:D Some of the other ones (Original RtCW, Alpha Centauri, and a few other others) I still have but don't really play anymore.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here is my 2 cents. &nbsp;I played a LOT of Duke Nukem 3D, even created a bunch of deathmatch levels for it. &nbsp;Made one that depicts the Moria Mine described in the Lord of the Rings. &nbsp;If anyone is still playing Duke, let me know and I will send you the maps. &nbsp;Duke is about the best game I ever played in terms of pure heart pounding fun. &nbsp;Danc and I must have played several hundred hours on-line together back then. &nbsp;If you want to get your butt kicked back into the stone-age, play Danc (Gamgee) on that game!!<br /><br />I never did like Doom, or Quake much. &nbsp;I played tons of US Navy Fighters in single player, it is an awesome flight sim. &nbsp;It is much better than Microsoft Flight Sim.<br /><br />I play lots of RTCW, and have a Linux game server up for it if anyone wants to play. &nbsp;Server is called &quot;Newbie Slaughterhouse&quot; at 24.117.85.58:27960. &nbsp;Very soon I will switch that server over to an Enemy Territory server.....as soon as I finish up the config files.<br /><br />Narsil</div>

Sure, its not that realistic as a &quot;hacking&quot; sim and the graphics are attractive, clean, but simple, but the gameplay is really addictive. I have been surprised how tense gaming sessions can get. Anyone catch themselves wondering if, while playing, you really *are* being used to crack systems? Maybe I'm just paranoid...</div>

The PS2 version, on the other hand, is considered a &quot;must play&quot; by some of the magazines I've read. I haven't played either version and wonder why the descrepency. What's it like, Nick, and what keeps you playing it?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don't know what it is about the PS2 version, but it seems to work well as a console FPS (controls are great). I didn't really get to play it much on the PC, but I have played it quite a bit on my PS2. I'm speaking of the original. There is a sequel out now, but I haven't played it. I'll give you my copy of the original when I come home if you want, rburt3.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Red Faction:<br /><br />The only portion I play is Capture the Flag. &nbsp;It's just a fun game, not as many hard-core players as there are in Q3 and U2k so after playing for a few days you can actually have fun (whereas new players in the other games end up getting slaughtered). &nbsp;<br /><br />The gameplay is good, I think it's easier to actually play than U2k3 when I tried that, but it may just be that I'm used to RF. <br /><br />I run 2 dedicated servers for the game. &nbsp;Their server software is really terrible, but it's enough to get by on.<br /><br />Other than that, who knows. &nbsp;It's just fun.<br /><br />Nick</div>
