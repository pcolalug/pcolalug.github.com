					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I will warn you of one company!<br />They do exclusive PHP/Mysql and often have ads for programmers.<br />I may be ranting here.........<br />But stay away from a company called InUSA company. They have a bad habit of offering cash bonuses for big php projects and then firing you as they wrap up and not paying......In my research to my last employer I have found 6 cases of this.<br />Just my advice........Use it as you will</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Don't know of any shops specializing in php/mysql, sorry. However, your cf skills should serve you well in this area. The shop I work for uses Java for our web-apps, but our stuff definately falls under the nebulous description of &quot;enterprise applications&quot;. That being said, there is a rumor going 'round that there's a PHP project in the works somewhere in the building. I'll let you know if I hear anything.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don't know what your situation is. &nbsp;If you're in school, PJC or UWF, then the school can get you a nice job using your skills. &nbsp;Talk to the co-op department. &nbsp;<br /><br />Just looking around most of the local shops are using coldfusion. &nbsp;I know PlugIt (plugit.com ?) uses different tools depending on the project. &nbsp;Some of their stuff is ASP. &nbsp;And they've done some PHP and ColdFusion too I think.<br /><br />There's another question, since there's like 20 shops in the area offering web development, are any of them making money or do they offer other services too, to make up for lack of income?<br /><br />Nick</div>
