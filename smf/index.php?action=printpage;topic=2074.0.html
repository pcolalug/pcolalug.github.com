					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I play this game religiously in windows every weekend even though it is several years old. &nbsp;I would like to get it up and running on my suse box. &nbsp;I have found a site that has a howto on getting it running under redhat and I am wondering if it will work for my suse box.<br /><br />http://www.princessleia.com/UT2.html<br /><br />Should the same installation work? &nbsp;Loki had a linux port but I had already purchased this game some time ago and didnt want to come of the money for the same game. &nbsp;Not to mention they are no longer in business. &nbsp;So if I could get it to work that would be great.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Lee</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am having trouble finding the directions I used to install the game. I bought mine about 2 years ago when I was first getting in to FPS games. I am thinking that there was a file on my CDs that told you how to install into Linux. Or maybe it pointed me to a website to get the information.<br /><br />Anyway, from what I have read today trying to find that information, I have found that it is supposedly difficult and that there are alot of pitfalls. Worked like a champ for me. Other than I just didn't like the game, I did not have any problems running it. But I also never got out of my second fight.<br /><br />If you don't get it running, post back here and I will see if I can dig up my CDs (assuming I brought them with me).<br /><br />Oh, something I remember from my install is that you did a full harddrive install and did not use the CDs.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I found my UT GOTY CDs. There were not any instructions on the CD for Linux. I didn't think there would be, but since I found instructions so easily before, I thought that there might be that possibility.<br /><br />Here is a page that might help.<br />http://faqs.lokigames.com/utfaq.html#41<br /><br />Whatever it was that I found originally just worked. Though it was a complicated list of steps to get it going.<br /><br />dpeach</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I found my disks but I have a problem. &nbsp;when I run the script it get to the point where it is supposed to copy files from the cdrom but I get:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">Please mount the Disc One CDROM.<br />Choose Yes to retry, No to cancel &#91;N/y&#93; y<br /><br />Please mount the Disc One CDROM.<br />Choose Yes to retry, No to cancel &#91;N/y&#93;</div><br /><br />My cdrom is listed as /media/dvdram so I created a symbolic link &quot;ln -s /media/dvdram /mnt/cdrom&quot; &nbsp;however it still does not work. &nbsp;Any ideas anyone?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Lee</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Lee,<br /><br />Found this in a Usenet post (after our IRC discussion), which I think will fix your problem. &nbsp;It references Suse 9.1 and UT2K4, but should be the same...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote"><br />I spent several hours last night working on a way to install Unreal<br />Tournament 2004 DVD Edition on SuSE 9.1 Pro. It had some problems, so<br />here are the fixes:<br /><br />First, submount and the Linux installer do not play well together. It<br />appears that the installer is set up to attempt to call 'mount' to<br />mount drives after each CD's contents are extracted, regardless of<br />whether or not you're actually installing it from a DVD or a series of<br />six CD's. It also doesn't care whether or not the media is already<br />mounted. So when installing from DVD you'll see a bunch of &quot;mount<br />failed: fstab shows media already mounted&quot; errors. I guess the<br />installer guesses that if it's already mounted, you'll get a harmless<br />warning and can truck on.<br /><br />But of course SuSE 9.1 does submounting by default, which means that<br />calling mount /dev/dvd will net you a big fat error code. And since<br />'mount' is returning an error code, the Linux UT2004 installer assumes<br />that you don't have a disc in the drive. *sigh*<br /><br />The workaround is to comment out your DVD/CD drive entry in /etc/fstab<br />and replace it with a conventional mount entry. For example:<br />/dev/dvd /media/dvd subfs<br />fs=cdfss,ro,procuid,nosuid,nodev,exec,iocharset=utf8 0 0<br /><br />Should be replaced with <br />/dev/dvd /media/dvd iso9660 user,ro 0 0<br /><br />Then things should install fine.</div><br /><br />Basically looks like you need to change the fstab entry for your DVD/CD drive. &nbsp;Give it a go.<br /><br />There might be some other useful information in the actual thread I got this from, the entire thing can be viewed here:<br />http://tinyurl.com/54asv<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for the info danc. &nbsp;I figured it out after a little research. &nbsp;I had to run:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">export SETUP_CDROM=/media/dvdram<br /></div><br /><br />And it installed without needing to manually mount and umount. &nbsp;Actually the Suse automount worked like a charm. &nbsp;I didnt have to do anything after running the code. &nbsp;When I eject it umounts and mounts perfectly.<br /><br />So I have it running but there is a issue I am trying to figure out with it being jumpy. &nbsp;Not like a network lagging issue its just like to fast and then it starts to jump. &nbsp;Any ideas. &nbsp;I am going to do some research on it.<br /><br />Lee</div>
