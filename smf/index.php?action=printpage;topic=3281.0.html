					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m getting back into Web design, and in order to do that, I need to be able to test site layout and scripting in multiple browsers.<br />I have FF and Opera, and I anticipate no difficulty installing Konq... but since it comes bundled on all new machines in the Windozing world, I need to see what kind of mayhem will be shown to users of the MSIE...<br />Looking around online, I ran across IEs 4 Linux. Does anyone have any experience with this, and is this the best method of testing, or what should I use instead?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have it and it works perfectly. I have no problem at all.<br /><br />I have Ubuntu 7.10, and I think I installed a deb for it.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thank you. I&#039;ll look into installing that some time this week. It&#039;s a dirty job, but Webmasters have to do it, don&#039;t we? :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">there is a website that shows you what your site looks like in different browsers. I can look around for it if that sounds like it would help.<br /><br />PS. I use mine for OWA.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">That sounds like it might help, depending on how good it is at emulating the browser.<br /><br />Re: PS, I use FF&nbsp; for that, but I try to avoid it as much as possible.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here is what I was talking about, but it does not let you interact with the page. Most of the problems I have had with IE vs. Firefox has been with layout and design, so it helps in that regard. I guess other than that, you would have to download every browser to be safe, unless there is a good firefox plugin for it.<br />Hum....<br /><br />http://browsershots.org/</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thank you. That&#039;s a cool site.<br />I&#039;m going to need something a bit more responsive, though, so I&#039;ll stick with the locally installable things.<br />I downloaded IEs4Linux and installed 6.0 and 7.0... They work, but they are, of course, hideous. I&#039;m going to have to boot my mom&#039;s machine into Windies and check against it there, but I think they are working correctly... um, I mean, accurately. IE does not render correctly at all. In some cases, it just says, &quot;No, I don&#039;t think I will show that DIV. You can&#039;t make me. I won&#039;t do it.&quot;<br />As though I needed any reminders about why I switched to FF and Opera. Oy.<br />I have my work cut out for me to try to make this thing render properly... or convince my clients that graceful failure is good enough. ;)<br />Thanks to everyone for the help.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">When I&#039;ve done web dev, I used a couple VM&#039;s, both XP, one with IE6 and the other with IE7. IEs4Linux is okay, but when you&#039;re needing to test production level stuff, I don&#039;t trust it to give an accurate representation of a Windows user&#039;s experience, especially when bringing in Javascript. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ll have to give that some serious thought. I don&#039;t have any experience, really, with using VMs. I&#039;ll just play it by ear for a little while and set that up if absolutely necessary. I&#039;m trying to stay light with my Web sites.. and I have a Windows partition on one of the machines here that I can do backup testing on.<br />Thank you all for your input.</div>
