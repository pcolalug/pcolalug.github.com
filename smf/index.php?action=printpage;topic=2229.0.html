					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well guys, I finally did it. &nbsp; I finally gave gentoo a fair shot.<br /><br />I spent 5 patient hour installing the gbr (plain ol binary install). &nbsp;Hand coded just about every config file known to linux (gpm wouldn't let me cp/paste out of links). &nbsp;Later had make.conf hosed by mirror select, corrected problem. &nbsp;Made stiff mixed drink, went to bed. &nbsp;Awoke 7am, &nbsp;walked through grub configuration and manual install, with the help of #gentoo (documentation in the massive handbook is lacking for alternate setups) . &nbsp;<br /><br />Moment of truth, reboot. &nbsp;Neither linux, or windows will boot. &nbsp;Spent the next several minutes uttering various expelitives. &nbsp;Roommate diagnosed problem as possible linux induced terets syndrome. &nbsp;Inserted slackware cd. &nbsp;Installed and running in 20 minutes. &nbsp;Priceless.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have had great Gentoo experiences. When I was testing out the pre-1.0 releases, I had rough times, but since then, I've followed the install manual everytime I needed to install and all went as planned. Any time I've had problems, someone else has talked about it in the forums (http://forums.gentoo.org). To be quite honest, I haven't had any more problems with Gentoo than I have with any other distribution.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Had a rough time of it my first go, but subsequent attempts went fairly smoothly. Not something you're going to get running in 20 minutes, though. Up and running, a Gentoo system can be a thing of beauty, no doubt, but you have to have time to learn what you need to learn and set up everything yourself. Seems the performance gap with binary/pre-configured systems is closing too.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I had a good time with Gentoo, right before I discovered Slackware. I am now a Slacker for life. I could not notice any difference in speed between Slack and Gentoo (I used as many cflags and use flags as I could find through Google and other Gentoo users' advice). I do not update enough to get the benefits of emerge, especially since it only takes a couple more steps with Sladkware using slapt-get or slackpkg. I am going to test out a Slackware version of portage at the end of the semester, since portage is the only advantage I see that Gentoo has over Slack.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Gentoo might become more mainstream one day, but there gona have to do some serious work putting together an installer. &nbsp;It doesn't have to be complex or fancy (look at slackware and debian's installers), but it has to be functional.<br /><br />Also I think they have to do a better job of integrating binaries into their package tree. &nbsp;No excuse for it to want to compile when I downloaded all those packages. &nbsp;Matter o fact I would like a system that behaves in a smarter way with the local file system. &nbsp;I would like it to go out and check things itself instead of you having to define them in some .conf file.<br /><br />My 2 cents<br />Brent</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You have missed the point of Gentoo all together. We've had this discussion previously (http://www.pcolalug.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1922). I'm not going to cover it again (http://www.pcolalug.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1300).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have Gentoo running on 3 computers, I had alot of headaches with it, but after you install it a few times, it really becomes quite easy, sure there isn&#039;t an installer, but that&#039;s no big deal really.&nbsp; I do however, miss the ease of just popping an installer cd in and letting it do its thing.&nbsp; Gentoo is the only distro I&#039;ve been happy with (minus FreeBSD).&nbsp; Alot of computers have weird problems with gentoo, some pcs it installs flawlessly, but other ones you have to tweak some stuff to get it working just right, but I think once you finally get it all setup, the amount of customization and stuff you can do to it is really worth it.&nbsp; That&#039;s just the way I see it.&nbsp; But hey, anything is better then Windows.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">ok I don&#039;t buy the Gentoo is only about installing from source....<br />don&#039;t try and argue this with me cause I spent a lot of time as a Gentoo dev and wrote the<br />1.4 install manual, yes there will be work into binaries at some point, and there is an installer<br />in progress now, in fact you can downlad the install cd with the beta installer<br /><br />there are many other advantages to Gentoo, one of the best being the init system and portage is for much more than building source files, it is a great tool for package management if you use source or binary packages.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I agree that it&#039;s not about the build from source. It&#039;s all about portage. I also use FreeBSD, so portage is a welcome sight to see in a Linux distro. I have even toyed with portage on Slackware and Fedora. It works fairly well on Slackware (my favorite Linux), and not too well on Fedora. It&#039;s a matter of preference. Some will argue that apt-get is better, or that the speed difference is not noticeable, etc. For me, I like portage and what it does for my system. I don&#039;t mind the crazy installation, since the handbook holds my hand throughout the entire installation. I don&#039;t mind the 10 years of compiling in the beginning, because I only have to do that once. Anytime after that, I just run emerge at night when I am sleeping, and it will be done in the morning.</div>
