					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I liked alot of what I saw with Slack 10. I have not tried running Slack as a desktop. I may give it a try. Was going to take a serious look at Suse, but I will do Slack first (it may make me like Suse a lot more :D )<br /><br />When I used Slack before it was with Fluxbox as my window manager. I am curious on the KDE 3.3. I have not moved off of 3.2 in my current install of Mandrake, so this should be a noticeable difference.<br /><br />I know the guys in the IRC channel will hear alot about this when I start running to them for help. But I will try to remember to keep the rest of you posted.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If I just change my swaret.conf to &quot;VERSION=10.1&quot; and the LinuxPackages.net line to 10.1 could I just run &quot;swaret --update&quot; and have my Slack 10 system updated to 10.1, or is it to where I'd need to reinstall the system?<br /><br />Sorry if it sounds moronic, just something I don't have a chance to try right now and can't remember if you can easily update. &nbsp;Also I REALLY don't want to reinstall the system since I've finally got just about everythine exactly how I like it.<br /><br />EDIT: &nbsp;nm, the LinuxPackages.net site says that almost everything under &quot;current&quot; is 10.1 so I suppose that might be better. &nbsp;Still a little wary about Current, but if that's how to easily upgrade I guess it'll have to do.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">current is a moving target<br />10.1 currently is identical to current, but soon there will be 10.1 -stable and then there will be -current and they won't be alike.<br /><br />and yes you can update to 10.1 by upgrading the packages using swaret or just &nbsp;doing things manually, I've done this from 9.1 to 10 without problems and it's the same sort of layout in slackware.....there might be a few things needing user changes but shouldn't be anything major.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've got it installed, which went uneventfully. &nbsp;Haven't done much with it yet, as I've been only partly successful getting my wireless (pcmcia) card to work. &nbsp;Should get it with some more twiddling.<br /><br />It comes default with the 2.4.29 kernel, with a 2.6.10 available on the CD if you want to install it afterwards. &nbsp;Don't notice any real differences yet, stay tuned.<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">OK, another update... &nbsp;I've got wireless working on my laptop with Slack 10.1. &nbsp;Was not as easy as I had hoped, had to do some editing of /etc/rc.wireless and /etc/rc.M and /etc/rc.inet1.conf (and modules.conf). &nbsp;Got the pcmcia NIC to come up that way, and then still had to manually fiddle with the default route and the like to get connected. &nbsp;Got some more searching and editing to do so it'll happen automatically on boot, but it's working (using it now). &nbsp;If anyone else is having issues with wireless, let me know...<br /><br />Almost hate to say it, but gonna take a quick peak at the (pretty new) KDE that comes with this... &nbsp; :wink: <br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have it up and running (nvidia drivers installed as my second official act, Firefox was the first). Having some LILO issues and can't get back to my main install. Maybe this will become my install of choice for lack of choice.<br /><br />So far I like what I see. On the one hand I don't like when distros highly customize the desktop environment so that you have trouble telling which window manager you are using. Slack has done a good job with this. This is just straight KDE from what I can tell.<br /><br />On the other hand, I do like when a distro cleans up what is installed by default and not give you every program known to man on the menu. Just the ones that Slack installed (I realize that many of these are KDE specific tools) I have 105 programs on my launch menu. This, of course, will not include most all of the command line tools available. 6 different media players!! And mplayer is not one of them. Not that it has to be, but Goodness Gracious! Why not!? If you are including all the others, what is one more? <br /><br />And no Firefox by default? What is up with that. The most popular OSS browser to come along and at a time that it is so popular. Seems like an odd thing to leave out.<br /><br />I don't want to sound too negative, but it is easier to say the few things I don't like rather than go through the whole list of things that make me say &quot;Wow!&quot; Since it is Linux, I am getting over that &quot;Wow!&quot; stage. I am very impressed with where Linux has come to. A tremendous change from several years ago.</div>
