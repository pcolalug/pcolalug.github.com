					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm not sure if anyone here is into MUDs but I just got back into them when I heard about &nbsp;Achaea (http://www.achaea.com) on ScreenSavers.<br /><br />For those that don't know what a MUD is, it stands for &quot;Multi-User Dungeon&quot;.<br />It's basically a text based RPG. &nbsp;You can find more info at The Mud Faq (http://www.mudconnect.com/mudfaq/).<br />They actually date back to 1978 as you can see on &nbsp;the Online World Timeline (http://www.legendmud.org/raph/gaming/mudtimeline.html)<br /><br />Anyway, I just got into Achaea and it's a pretty cool world. <br /><br />For those that are currently playing Muds:<br />Which ones do you frequent?<br />How long have you been playing?<br />What's the best Mud client for Linux? (Anything close to Zmud?)<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Steve</div>

I had problems with the font and it looked kinda basic. I like the Java client that Achaea is using. It's very good for a java app. I can also run it at home on Linux or at work on Windows. (Of course, I never play games at work. :D )<br /><br />I'd like to find a client like Windows' Zmud. It has mapping and a whole bunch of features that make Mudding a little easier.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Zmud for linux would be great indeed but its not gonna happen. &nbsp;I have a registerd copy of zmud that I used when I used windows but now I don't use windows at all and zmud will not work in wine or winex due to the elicense issue. <br />There is a mapping function in Gnome-mud but its realy not much and gnome-mud is buggy at this time. &nbsp;If you new to mudding you might tolerate the java interface but since it doen't have support for macros, that I am aware of anyway, I tend to avoid it. &nbsp; When you get into macros you will discover that tinyfuge has no equal but if you find one for linux that has all the features of zmud please let me know.<br />I emailed zuggsoft about zmud for linux or support in wine and they basicly said it was not going to happen. &nbsp;That was about a year ago so you might want to check again.<br /><br />Mitchr</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The Java applet client that the developpers of Achaea wrote does support macros, triggers, aliases, and other stuff. I've been told, though, if you have a lot of triggers it can lock up at the most inoportune times. (Can you say die? :lol: ) Anyway, I may still play around with TF. That's the nice thing about Muds, you can change clients as often as you wish without losing your character or game.<br /><br />Steve</div>
