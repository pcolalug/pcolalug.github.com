					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just got a chance to watch that since work blocked it, but that was awesome. You know how there are things in life where you have a feeling of wanting that time back once your done? Not here. That was well worth me running a few minutes behind for. <br /><br />Not to bash MS here, but they throw a ton of unnecessary crap on the outside of their packaging. I mean come on. If you are going into a store to buy something for &gt;$100, you would think you would do your research prior. It&#039;s like they think their packaging is going to be that last minute determination of whether to get it or something else. Store shelves are not the place to make decisions on big ticket software/hardware.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I saw this video about a week ago. It was great. Had to watch it again when posted here.<br /><br />Great for a laugh, but also is very revealing about 2 very different marketing styles. Apple is classy in its simplicity.</div>
