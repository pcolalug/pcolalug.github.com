					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey there. &nbsp;New to the Linux world. &nbsp;Have been using it some, but only enough to be dangerous to myself!!<br /><br />Wondering if any of you know about a Linux tool (RedHat, SuSE, Turbo, ... don't really care which right now) that will migrate all the accounts from a Windows NT Domain to Linux.<br /><br />I'm looking real hard at SAMBA to replace the every growing Windows farm. &nbsp;I don't really have that many accounts, but if there is something handy that could suck the life outta the Windows box, and propogate the accounts on the Linux box for me, that would be a big help.<br /><br />Know of anything?<br /><br />David.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Be careful about just replacing windows file servers with samba linux machines. &nbsp;I tried that with a real estate company, but the old (very old) dos-based BTrieve software they used wouldn't work well with samba. &nbsp;Unexplained lockups and dissapearing shares. &nbsp;I imaging it works very well with newer software, but this stuff was ancient. &nbsp;As soon as I took the machine back to being a windows server everything worked properly again. &nbsp;Oh well - I tried...<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay, after much googling and nashing of teeth, I found this (http://www.osopinion.com/perl/story/20673.html). If you look at the last paragraph on that page, you will see what you are looking for. The bad news is, this transparent migration they speak of is due to be released with ver 3.0. We ain't there yet, so tough cookies. Perhaps you can do a little more research and find something that might be an option for you. Funny that you say, suck the life out of the nt box and the new migration feature is called Net RPC Vampire :P<br /><br />Good luck!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Nick and &quot;Rugmonster&quot; -<br />Thank you both for the post. &nbsp;This is very early in the planning, &quot;can we do it&quot; phase. &nbsp;I have one RH8 Samba setup now, as a file server it's been ok.<br /><br />All of the company software (computing) is done locally. &nbsp;With the exception of the accounting, timekeeping package, they don't have any server based applications. &nbsp;Everyone just opens files, works on files, saves files.<br /><br />Thanks for the tip on the BTrieve, I'll be sure to test lots before pulling the trigger. &nbsp;We'll have to keep at least one or two W2K/W2K3 boxes in the mix, I'm just looking to reduce the number.<br /><br />David.</div>
