					Post by: <b>dpeach</b> on <b>June 27, 2003, 11:59:55 pm</b>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you have a winmodem that is made with the Conexant chipset, there is hope for you in getting it to work in Linux.<br /><br />Linuxant has been &nbsp;(http://www.linuxant.com/drivers/)given the blessing of Conexant to build Linux drivers for their hardware. Apparently they are getting quite a bit of help from Conexant. I have one of their modems (thanks bhoff) that I tried to get going once before. It did not work with the driver that they had built in December. But they have a new driver for my modem that was put out just a couple of months ago. It now works.<br /><br />I will caution you to get the right one. They have many binaries. You are asked to choose a binary based on your distro and kernel version. I don't know what it will do if you get the wrong one, but I don't think I want to find out. On the site they make it clear that you need to choose the right one.</div>
