					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Mviron and I have been discussing the possibility of making our next quarterly meeting a joint session with his C&amp;C group at UWF late July.<br /><br />Unless anyone has any objections, I&#039;ll be posting information regarding the meeting in the coming days.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">[bump]<br /><br />It seems nobody has either noticed (or nobody objects to) this topic. &nbsp;Our July meeting can take place either <b>this</b> Thursday at SSI (as per our regular schedule), or on <b>next</b> TUESDAY with the C&amp;C Society at UWF.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">So...........&nbsp; how did this meeting go?&nbsp; Did anyone attend?&nbsp; Any interest in the LUG from the C2JS folks?<br /><br />How come nobody posted any follow-on info here after the meeting???&nbsp; I was on vacation the last three weeks, but this place is even more of a ghost-town than usual.<br /><br />Is the LUG officially dead and gone?&nbsp; Is anyone at all interested in continuing it any longer?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Dan<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yeah.&nbsp; Only 3 people showed up, so it wasn&#039;t really the greatest meeting of all time or anything.&nbsp; We mostly sat around and talked about the status of the LUG and the possibility of holding more joint meetings at UWF.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t call the LUG dead exactly.&nbsp; More like... asleep on the couch at 1 am with the TV blaring.</div>
