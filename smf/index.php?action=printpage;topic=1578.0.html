					Title: <b>Microsoft vs GM</b><br />
					Post by: <b>imnes</b> on <b>April 28, 2004, 06:37:43 pm</b>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">At a recent computer expo<br />(COMDEX), Bill Gates reportedly compared the computer industry with the auto<br />industry and stated, &quot;If GM had kept up with technology like the computer<br />industry has, we would all be driving $25.00<br />cars that got 1,000 miles to the gallon&quot;.<br /><br />In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued a press release<br />stating: If GM had developed technology like Microsoft, we would all be<br />driving cars with the following characteristics (and I just love this part):<br /><br />1. For no reason whatsoever, your car would crash twice a day.<br /><br />2. Every time they repainted the lines in the road, you would have to<br />buy a new car.<br /><br />3. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason. You<br />would have to pull over to the side of the road, close all of the windows,<br />shut off the car, restart it, and reopen the windows before you could<br />continue. For some reason you would simply accept this.<br /><br />4. Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn would cause<br />your car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have<br />to reinstall the engine.<br /><br />5. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was<br />reliable, five times as fast and twice as easy to drive -- but would run on<br />only five percent of the roads.<br /><br />6. The oil, water temperature, and alternator warning lights would all<br />be replaced by a single &quot;This Car Has Performed An Illegal Operation<br />&quot;warning light&quot;.<br /><br />7. The airbag system would ask &quot;Are you sure?&quot; before deploying.<br /><br />8. Occasionally, for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out<br />and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle,<br />turned the key and grabbed hold of the radio antenna.<br /><br />9. Every time a new car was introduced car buyers would have to learn<br />how to drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in<br />the same manner as the old car.<br /><br />10.You'd have to press the &quot;Start&quot; button to turn the engine off.</div>
