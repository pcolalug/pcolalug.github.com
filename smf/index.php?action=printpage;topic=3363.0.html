					Title: <b>Laptop PS brick</b><br />
					Post by: <b>Skreyola</b> on <b>June 06, 2008, 08:38:13 pm</b>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have an IBM Thinkpad 600E that a very kind person gave me, and it needed a power supply/cord.<br />I called Lenovo and got the replacement part numbers, then hunted around. I don&#039;t recall for sure, but I think I found a PS that claims to be compatible with the part numbers Lenovo gave me (02K6545 or 02K3381), but now that it has arrived, I&#039;m nervous about using it.<br />The specs on the base of the laptop say it runs on 16V@2.6A (41.6W, if I&#039;m calculating right)<br />The replacement part numbers were for a 56W PS.<br />The PS that arrived is a 72W providing 16V@4.5A.<br />The rating on the brick is the maximum rating, right? This is safe to use with my laptop?&nbsp; :???:<br />I feel kind of silly, but I don&#039;t want to fry anything, so I figure it&#039;s better to ask and feel silly than to not ask and risk seeing the magic blue smoke.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am not an electronics man like Brett but I think as long as the voltage is the same you are alright. As for the wattage you just have more than you need which I don&#039;t think is a bad thing. Maybe Brett will happen along and give his 2 cents.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Actually those specs are not what it puts out default, But more what it can supply if load demands it.<br />It is like a house you put a 200amp service which gives you the ability to safely draw 200 amps of power to supply your house needs.<br />Where as if you had an older 60amp service and suddenly add a dryer, tanning bed and new super computer well then you are going to start kicking breakers.<br /><br />As for your brick as long as the power supply meets the required volts and the adapter matches up(meaning the - and + match up with the old one you should be fine. Now if you ever get a short or something in the laptop then you could have issues due to the fact&nbsp; that the power supply can supply a larger load. So I think you are safe ...that coming from a long time hardware hacker and Lic. Electrician.<br /><br />P.S&nbsp; how was that for timeliness </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks, Brett and Ed.<br />I&#039;ll give it a go. What&#039;s the worst that could happen?&nbsp; ;)<br />Don&#039;t answer that. hehe.<br />Well, so far so good. It seems to boot up fine. Thanks to you two, and thanks to the one who gave me the laptop. I can&#039;t recall off the top of my head which LUG member it was.<br />Cheers!</div>
