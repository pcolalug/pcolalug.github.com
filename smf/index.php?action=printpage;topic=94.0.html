					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">For all of you &quot;Drakies&quot; (and man, aren't there a *lot* of you around here!), there is a nice review (http://mandrakeforum.com/article.php?thold=-1&amp;mode=flat&amp;order=0&amp;sid=2371&amp;lang=en) of the MicroTel PC's offered via WalMart.com (http://www.walmart.com). &nbsp;Very positive review by a normal user. &nbsp;At around $US500 for a low end system (sans monitor), this seems like a great way to get new users turned on to Linux.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Good review rburt3. I enjoyed reading the posts after the review. They seemed to give as much good information as the review did. <br /><br />If I was ever inclined to buy a new machine I might look at one of these. I typically pick up someone else's junker and give it a good home. The last junker I picked up was an Athlon 1.4 with 768 MB RAM and a 40 GB hard drive. Not a bad junker for under $400.<br /><br />I know that Microtel has been around a while. What are people's opinions on them from the hardware end? Do they include solid hardware, or have they just slapped in cheap stuff that is all buggy? I have never heard opinions either way about them.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Dude! Where do you get your <i>junk</i>!!!??<br />Speaking of which, they new guy is looking for a laptop if you haven't seen his post on the swap meet. &nbsp;I'd love one myself for a decent price!<br /><br /><br />Seriously, though, I haven't heard anything too bad about the hardware, and from the review, support seems really good. &nbsp;In fact, these are the same folks who replaced the winmodem lickety-split when the Linux crowd bemoaned the fact that these things are lossy and don't work with Linux/BSD.<br /><br />You know, we could write them and see if we could get a test machine to do our own review of then ship it back when we're done. &nbsp;Just a thought. &nbsp;In fact, the main website needs some more *stuff* to it. &nbsp;You know, like transcripts of the presentations once that gets started, reviews, how-to's and the like. &nbsp;Brought to you from the friendly folks at the P'Cola LUG!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I really like the thought of being able to review an O'Reilly book for free. We could have a section of just reviews either in the forums or on the main site.<br /><br />One of the great benefits of travel is that you are in many places and can jump on many deals. So I pick up my &quot;junk&quot; at different places. Got this most recent computer out of Nashville. The guy did not like it because it was too noisy (with 7 fans I understand why). So he let it go for cheap.<br /><br />I have not run accros too many notebook deals, but I will keep my ear open.</div>
