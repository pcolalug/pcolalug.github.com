					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have a P3/550 with a Nvidia Riva TNT2 video card. I can run Quake 3 well and RtCW decently at 800x600. I want to try some more games, but would like to get some suggestions on what to try. I know with this older system, I will be limited. Also, what would you guys recommend short of a new mobo/proc to make this a little more game friendly? I'm not a big gamer and I don't have any other major motivating factor to make a major upgrade. Too bad you can't do a beowulf cluster to process your favorite games because then I would be set :P</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">As you probably know, the video card is important for a gaming machine. &nbsp;I think something like an Nvidia GF4 would improve your gaming ability. &nbsp;At least 256Mb of main memory is a good idea too. &nbsp;The GF4's have come down in price as the newer stuff is out (or soon to be). &nbsp;As for other games, the ones you listed are all I've used in Linux, although I'm struggling to get UT2k3 working, which I enjoy in Windows. &nbsp;It's probably the most taxing on hardware of the games I know.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Fix your TV and revisit Final Fantasy X! <br /><br />Really, though, I had a great time with the ERA linux demo for all of the 25 minutes I have a month to play games. It was originally concieved as a re-make of the Ultima series of games, but is now more of an omage, if you will (and you might!). Not a lot to do yet, but it looks pretty. I can't remember the url off hand, but you're sure to find it on the Linux Game Tome (http://www.happypenguin.org).<br /><br />You should also give the Neverwinter Nights beta a try.<br /><br />As for your upgrades, they'll probably need to be done before you give UT a try. I would sugguest that if money is tight, go with one of the GeForce 3 Ti graphics cards. They have plenty of power and run today's games fabulously. The N-Force based mobos aren't too bad, either, from what I've heard. You could probably do all of this (card, mobo, processor) for a couple hundred (assuming you used last-gen parts and went with AMD, that is).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think I am going to invest in a GeForce4 TI4200. I figure I'll save some money from this pay period and then buy it next pay period. Also, if anyone would like to help me continue the celebration of my 22nd birthday, which was on the 14th, I'm sure we could work out something...paypal, check or money order...<br /><br />Maybe I can buy a new component a month. In a few months, I'll have built a new system.</div>
