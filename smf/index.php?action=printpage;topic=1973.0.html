					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Nope, it's not out yet. &nbsp;=P<br /><br />Still, I figured I'd let you all know as they're shooting for a release pretty soon here. &nbsp;I think there's a beta available but I've been too busy to grab it.<br /><br /><br /><br />Oddly enough this is quite a bit like something I was going to start on last year, GPLing the Quake 1. &nbsp;Hmmm...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ah, double-checked the downloads page, they've got some ingame movies ready but no release files yet. &nbsp;Still, should be released by the end of this year, beginning of next year apparently after quite awhile in development. &nbsp;I'm kind of excited.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I checked out the two in-game videos and I must say I'm impressed for an OSD project. &nbsp;Pretty d**n amazing, really. &nbsp;I'm hoping they'll release their tools to publicly develop maps because to be brutally honest I think even I design snappier looking maps (not better playing perhaps, but definitely better looking) but I suppose I'd rather have a functional map. &nbsp;Still, I know some mappers who would love to port over some kick-*** maps they've made for something like this.<br /><br />Seems like a free Quake III...which is fine by me considering that Quake III is still the standard in terms of competition.</div>
