					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just installed freebsd 5.2.1 yesterday on my AMD k6 2 500mhz machine. &nbsp;The install went well (to my knowledge), after I bootup everything seems to be running fine except whenever a process needs to run I get this message on the screen: 'calcru: negative time of -582613 usec for pid 672 (sh)' , of course this is not the only one, there are many different ones, but one appears on the screen at a time. &nbsp;The time it's always negative, from what I understand, whenever the kernel sees something weird going on it will output that on the screen. &nbsp;I googled for a while, and found out many other people are having this problem too, but noone really talked about a way to fixing it.<br /><br />I did find this fix: 'sysctl -w kern.timecounter.method=1', after I typed that on the console it didn't help (I actually got some error, but I can't remember what it was, yes, I checked the syntax many times), I have read some posts saying that might fix it but with some performance lost. &nbsp;I would like try to fix it without any performance lost if I can avoid it.<br /><br />If anyone has this problem before and know a fix please let me know, thanx in advance.<br /><br />p.s I did the bare bone install using floppy and network connection, I'm always on IRC in #pcolalug, if you need to find me, that's where I'll be.<br /><br />Aaron</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would go back to the 4.x series, the 5 series of FreeBSD is known to have buggy timekeeper code in it. &nbsp;I don't think there's a fix yet.<br /><br />Nick</div>
