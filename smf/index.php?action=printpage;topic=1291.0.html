					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I thought I would say hi.<br /><br />It looks like there are a lot of new members in January! &nbsp;I recently moved here from California and stumbled across your site when searching the net for local Lugs. &nbsp;I was told the nearest was in Ft Walton. &nbsp;Glad to see my informer was wrong.<br /><br />I am planning on being at the meeting tomorrow. &nbsp;I am hoping someone can assist me with configuring my RH 9 system to recognize my Belkin wirless card. &nbsp;I have seen several posts on the web that say it is supported and have &nbsp;downloaded the instructions and drivers, they just involve compiling. &nbsp;I have not yet been brave enough to compile the kernal source.<br /><br />&nbsp;:? &nbsp;Michael</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">There were three people that I did not get around to personally meeting. I missed meeting you Michael. <br /><br />I agree to the recompiling the kernel business. I think that would make a good meeting topic. I compiled one this weekend (and it worked somewhat). Don't let anyone tell you it is not scary. I guess you eventually get used to doing it, but it is not something I enjoy.<br /><br />Did you get the help you need? Anyone in the group that runs Gentoo should be experts at recompiling kernels. It seems that to run Gentoo you have to be willing to recompile every couple of days.<br /><br />Start a thread in the hardware area and give us the specs on which card you have and your RedHat system. Also, post links to any helpful (although maybe confusing) sites that you have visited to help with the problem.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Now, David, that's not true. *If* you compiled it correctly in the first place... ;)</div>
