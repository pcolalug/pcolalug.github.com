					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">First and foremost, it was decided that with no accepted nominations for president, that we would postpone the elections until October meeting.&nbsp; We have one more month to think about and nominate more people, do so here (http://www.pcolalug.org/smf/index.php?topic=3389.0).<br /><br />We had 8 attendees to the meeting, which is much better than the last two months!&nbsp; I hope to see more in the coming months!<br /><br />The presentations from Brett were quite good, thank you for providing for us, Brett!<br /><br />Our next meeting is scheduled for October 16, 2008, same time, same place.&nbsp; Show up, and bring a friend! :)<br /><br />Ian</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I enjoyed the meeting. It was nice to get to meet everyone that was there and I liked the presentations. And I even learned a few things I can put to use on my linux systems. Looking forward to next month&#039;s meeting.<br /><br />Mike</div>
