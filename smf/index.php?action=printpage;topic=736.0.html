					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well guys forget about Beowulf clusters...Yes I am still going to write an article how to, but OpenMosix is where it is at. can be easily compiled into any kernel and you gentoo and debian freaks are a head up on us.<br />There are tar balls and rpms for the rest of us. <br />Here is the kicker...when setting up a beowulf it is basically useless unless you create software for it using either the PVM or MIR libraries to allow the clustering effect, But in OpenMosix you get benefits from the cluster without any programming. Yes that's right you heard me no Programming and the best part the more processes that are spawned from the app you are running from a web browser to webservers and database mining or Enemy territory you only get better response across the cluster.<br />Say you are running Mozilla which only spans one process...what's that you say no help..Wrong it will send the process to which ever node will give it the better boost. sound too good to be true read more at there website. http://www.openmosix.org</div>

I have downloaded the kernel patch and the RPM for kernel 2.4-18 which is the mandrake 8.2 kernel and plan on installling today. Will post here how it goes and if I get any noticable gain playing E.T...I have 5 machines all ready to get Mandrake8.2.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here we go I have downloaded both the patch for those of us who have tweaked our kernels and the default RPM also. I applied patch to my custom kernel and had no problems..also used RPM on other mandrake 8.2 machine and it worked even better.....created all the needed soft links so if I upgrade the cluster kernel already pointing to right area and modified my boot loader to give me options of kernels.<br />Way cool...............<br />Still have to load the tools package tonight......<br />So far have run gimp with noticable improvement...............<br />Soon as I can get copy of E.T I will try it ...................:(</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">bhoff,<br /><br />So, what you are saying is, if I set up one machine as an LTSP server,<br />and set up X number of machines as nodes, then I get 1 fast LSTP server?<br /><br />( aside from the power bill, this seems like a good way to put older machines to some good use instead of sending them to the landfill)?<br /><br />lester</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">OK..OK I went ahead and browsed over the LTSP+OpenMosix information.<br />What you basically get is a master able to run whatever app you choose better than before how much depends on how many child processes are created to be migrated to the nodes, next is how many nodes.<br />while the Nodes get to be used as x terminals like normal with all there extra computing power being used by OpenMosix.<br />Here is the kick thou.<br />OpenMosix likes to have room to swap on each node....so to play nice you need like a 500meg hd on each node or prefered is 128meg ram much faster.<br /><br /><br />(NOTE!) here you bet much better response from 100 vs 10 on your network so be sure you are using the proper switch or better yet use dual cards in each node and get true bi-syn communication between each node.<br /><br />Also note I am removing Mandrake from everything and putting RedHat 7.2 &nbsp;also gives performance boost....Really nice............</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well the RPM's will work with Mandrake, but they are built using plain jane RH kernels and not the Mandrake...So there is some conflict.<br />Plus the main development is towards RH,SUSE, and Gentoo as far as the add ons. It will work with Mandrake just better install and migation with RH I am using 7.2 because that is what I have........No 8.0 or better :(</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I now have a 4 node cluster up and running, but I've noticed that<br />some processes such as apache and mysql will not migrate because they use shared memory.<br /><br />It looks like OpenMosix is a good idea, but it still needs some work.<br /><br />If separate Apache and Mysql processes would migrate across the cluster, this would mean huge performance gains for web and database servers, hopefully causing big corporations to give a lot more serious thought to Linux.<br /><br />Now add the fact that a master node on the cluster can be set &nbsp;up as an LTSP server and now you have all sorts of old machines which would normally be scrapped converted to X-terminals.<br /><br />One machine to administer, one machine to install software on, one machine to back up. A client-server environment.<br /><br />Configure the same master node to run the most common Windows apps using Wine, and you have a recipe that would bring Microsoft to it's knees.<br /><br />An operating system tha can be made more secure than Windows will ever imagine...<br /><br />An operating system that is more stable than Windows will ever be...<br /><br />And you can run Windows apps on it...<br /><br />The only drawback I see is the power bill for running all those computers...<br /><br />Here's hoping that the OpenMosix, LTSP, and Wine groups get together and bring this vision to light...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am working on a better how-to that will show you how to ge the most out of your cluster. If you just have text based nodes set up then it is hard to see the diffrence but when you throw in a gui based node then you are cooking. also you have to use mosctl to let the processes migrate.<br />I had mysql migrate across the board on a database search and a php to mysql transaction. Also there is a memory patch for OpenMosix that allows for you to use the full amount of ram in the entire cluster. This would benefit Apache...Also note here I am running a perl script out of my cgi bin and everytime it gets a new hit it migrates to another node. Those of you out there that run system admin know what I am talking about. this is handy.</div>
