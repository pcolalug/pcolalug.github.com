					Post by: <b>Yossarian</b> on <b>December 11, 2009, 11:05:34 pm</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Our next meeting will be held on the third Thursday of January, the 21st, 2010. &nbsp;I know this is over a month away right now but I&#039;d like to remind everyone so they can keep their schedule&#039;s clear for that date. &nbsp;As you know meetings are now quarterly instead of monthly. &nbsp;With fewer of them the importance of these meetings increases, so try to think of attendance as mandatory.<br /><br /><br />Since this will be the first meeting of a new decade as well, I&#039;d like to see it more of as an event than a typical meeting. &nbsp;The last time we tried a LAN party was an utter disappointment (the details of which shall not be discussed). &nbsp;However at Nerd Invasion, me, Ian, and new member Fretsejaz were able to set up a 3-man wireless gaming session of Assault Cube, so I think we can make it happen again in January. &nbsp;I&#039;ll also be preparing a presentation of some sort for the meeting. &nbsp;If anyone else would also like to do a presentation (possibly on a new toy they end up getting for Christmas) that&#039;d be great as well.<br /><br /><br />Also, since Thursday is a weeknight this may pose some problems for certain members. &nbsp;If the LUG would rather see a longer meeting on a Saturday, please discuss it below.<br /><br /><br /><br />Also:&nbsp; If anyone ever wishes to talk with someone from the steering committee, both me and gree_dragon37 are in the IRC channel almost every night. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would prefer the meeting(s) be on a Saturday, myself.&nbsp; I cannot predict how late I may be working on most weeknights.<br /><br />I have a new Compaq Mini netbook that I will bring and demo if anyone is interested in it.&nbsp; Quite a handy little machine, these netbooks.<br /><br />As for presentations, I am willing to do one at most any meeting.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to discuss potential topics with attendees to see where the interest lies, and do one accordingly.&nbsp; I will probably dust off one of my old previous presentations (basic command line) and be prepared to do it in January if anyone wants to see it.<br /><br />If anyone has a specific request for a presentation topic, please say something now, and perhaps it can be done in January as well.<br /><br />Dan<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">January will be my first meeting with you guys, but depending on how long we are going to meet up and what talks are already prepared, I&#039;d be willing to do one... I don&#039;t know what I&#039;d do it on... <br /><br />Some ideas if anyone is interested:<br />In depth usage of find<br />ssh tunnels/gpg keys (we could do a key signing party?)<br />intro to git<br />vim + python<br />intro to django<br />intro to google appengine <br />intro to django on appengine?<br /><br />Let me know! I&#039;m excited to meet everyone :)<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok, So I&#039;ve decided (if there is time for me) to do a talk on Remote Desktop options in Linux, I will focus mainly on ssh with X forwarding and freenx but will also show vnc.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sounds great sontek!!&nbsp; It&#039;s great to see a new member willing to do a presentation!<br /><br />As for me, I&#039;d like to do a presentation on VirtualBox and some of its features, and possibly, if I get the chance, the web console.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">UPDATE:<br /><br />Join us in the IRC if you can.&nbsp; There&#039;s usually at least 3 of us on every night.<br /><br />As for the meeting we&#039;re discussing having the meeting on Saturday instead of Thursday.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I can hold off on the Wine presentation for the time being, though it&#039;ll still be available just in case.<br /><br />The main concern, as mentioned in the IRC about 20 minutes ago, is lloydr, the keymaster, being available on Saturday.</div>

Thursdays worked out better for me as it was about the time I was getting off work and I would just stay late. I&#039;m working normally 1-2 weekends a month and the other weekends normally are planned a few months in advance of crap I&#039;ve got to finish from months past. lol right now my weekends are being spent getting my dumbarse ex&#039;s crap out of my house. fun fun fun... anyone scouted a location that could be used for saturdays if the interest is there for moving days? <br /><br />The other problem you would run into with here at ssi is depending on the nature of the meeting, the conference room tends to stay cluttered now with plans and submittals, so anything much more than a normal meeting is difficult.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sorry to hear about the weekend crap, hope that gets sorted out for you real soon.<br /><br />As for locations, I looked into getting a venue at UWF.&nbsp; However, it doesn&#039;t look like we&#039;ll get one before the date of the meeting, as the CS and Engineering department is moving to a new building, and things aren&#039;t 100% finished yet.<br /><br />Another possible location is the Pensacola Public Library just down the street, however they close at 8 on Thursdays and 5 on Saturday.&nbsp; So, meetings would have to be on a time limit.<br /><br /><br />As of now the meeting date is slated for the original date:&nbsp; Thursday January 21, 2010&nbsp; at our usual location at SSI.&nbsp; If anyone has any questions please feel free to ask.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I was just told an hour or so ago that I&#039;m headed to panama city early in morning and need to be up by about 2:30am, so the meeting is going to need to be real short. How are the plans coming for finding a new venue? I don&#039;t mind opening the door but I&#039;ve gotta hit the sack early tonight so time frame for meeting is going to need to be shortened.<br /><br />Thanks</div>
