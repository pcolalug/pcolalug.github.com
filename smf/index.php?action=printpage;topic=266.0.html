					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ok i know you have to pay for lindows,or do you?<br />My point is this, i dont want support or membership from them as I can get it from anywhere. So I would like to get a copy of lindows 3.0 .I'm wondering does anybody have a copy or knows where I can get one?<br /><br />No, its short term a fix to have the Linux and its dabian after all.<br />suse is going desktop as of Jan. So I guess I want to see more . I more then likely will be getting that. &nbsp;Of course I give you a bad hardrive you turn it in and get a new one in exchange for a new harddrive with suse or mandrake on it . lol . k it was a pipe dream. as of right now I have to wait for stupid samsung to return my hardrive after I send it off. When I get to it . So you see time and space is the reason I want Lindows.<br />fell free to email. &nbsp;:D</div>

(If there are, I'll have to remove them. Sorry) <br /><br />With that out of the way, there are plenty of &quot;free&quot; Linux desktop distributions. Why not try some of them out before looking to pirate something that someone has decided to sell? Try here. (http://www.distrowatch.com/)<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Its not pirating . After all everything they are &quot;selling&quot; is freeware. They have admitted to it themselves. As i stated earlier its the membership and staroffice they are selling and heck there is hardly any differnce bettween staroffice and open office, except open is free and a few other minor differnces.<br /><br />This is why wine drop ther deal from them ,partnership. &nbsp;They said they where and are selling free stuff,but they claim they arent. So when I get this way i dont want hep or membership from them and im uninstalling staroffice as i have many other alternatives. &nbsp;:)</div>

That tells me that they are charging for a product. As such, it would be considered stealing in this country to try to get a copy of it without paying the authoring company. <br /><br />I think that sometimes there tends to be some confusion as to differentiating between opensource software downloadable for free and distributions using open source software for sale. <br /><br />You are not paying for the open source software. You can download it from the many sites making the software. (Most of it on sourceforge)<br />What you are paying for is the authors ability to combine multiple opensource software packages and write an install routine to install it in an easy to use manner. You are also paying for any proprietary software included. <br /><br />If you want the opensource packages used in Lindows then just go to sourceforge and download it. Otherwise, you should go to Lindows.com and pay them for the time and effort they put into developing their fine products.<br /><br />Opensource and GPL software is free. The time people take to write routines to make all that software play together nicely in a distribution often is not free. If no one payed for Mandrake, SuSE, RedHat, Lindows etc. then Linux would IMHO be a dead OS. It's the people willing to support the distros with cold, hard cash that keep Linux in the forefront.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If hard drive space is a problem, have you tried Knoppix (http://www.knoppix.net)?<br /><br />I think many of us have a copy of it, and it is freely distributable. Let us know and one of us can probably get you a copy.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">humm that is well I will accept that . Main reason was ease of use -desktop style. Beides nobody pays for any linux form unless you by the package deal. You can freely download suse and any other. Liek I said its &nbsp;the space. I will look into it send me a link or email me. Thanks again.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This link (http://www.knoppix.net) will get you to a page that has a whole lot about what Knoppix is and does. It is not the original site, but it is easier to read and understand.<br /><br />Here is a link (http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/)to the official site.<br /><br />The beauty of it is that it runs in a RAM disk and does not take any hard drive space at all. Can't beat that for a small footprint. <br /><br />All you need is a computer that will boot from the CD. Runs very fast based on everything being in RAM. If I remember correctly, it has over 2 GB of &quot;stuff&quot; on 1 standard CD. Not sure how they do it.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If ease of use is an issue, check out Lycoris (http://www.lycoris.org). Its free to download (just be sure to get all three iso's, and Sweeden's mirror isn't as throttled), and *very* user friendly.</div>
