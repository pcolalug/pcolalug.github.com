					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Every so often, someone will ask me about local providers of web design services.<br /><br />Does anyone here have any suggestions?&nbsp; A local company that can take a client from domain reg, to hosting, to design, to ecommerce implementation, to self management.<br /><br />On the radio, I hear about Global Business Solutions, and Coco Design. Coco Design, I&#039;ve seen their work at least.&nbsp; Anyone else I can point people to?<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Not to toot my own horn, but I do a bit of design myself. Domain reg and hosting is trivial. Self management is part of a good design. E-commerce is very broad, but once again proper design and an understanding of a companies needs is key. Most companies that advertise these things, I would say, offer cookie cutter solutions that leave much to be desired. Hiring a good, qualified, private consultants to build a solution is really the way to go and there are several of us around here that could help with that.</div>

It&#039;s not trivial by any means. :)&nbsp; A few years back, I was knee deep in trying to untangle the domains/hosting files of thousands of small business who had been duped by a company called Featurprice. Boy was that a mess.&nbsp; The 2nd/3rd tier $4.99 hosters are full of charlatans and wannabes w. a single colo&#039;d server sitting in a shed somewhere on a frac t. LOL.<br /><br />Sometimes the cookie cutter can work. No need to be l33t about it!&nbsp; I realize that peeps have to make their money, but there is something to be said for decent design, and good seo.&nbsp; Bottom line is, whatever works for the customer and helps them generate leads/revenue.<br /><br />Thanks for the info.</div>

Secondly, you shouldn&#039;t have to deal with your registrar any more than once a year...at the most. Go with whoever is the cheapest. I&#039;ve used Godaddy.com for three years and I&#039;ve never had an issue with them.</div>
