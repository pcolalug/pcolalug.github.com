					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have a 10/100 NIC that is attached to my cable modem from my router (this NIC is in the router). The cable modem only talks 10.<br /><br />On occasion, my Internet connection is down. I look over at my NIC and the light that tells me it is working in 100 mode is lit. I have to bring the NIC down and back up and get the IP served back to it. <br /><br />How can I force the NIC to only work in 10? This happens every few weeks where I have to reset it.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">KNE111TX. It is a Kensington NIC. It uses the Tulip driver.<br /><br />When I posed the question I expected this to be just a standard answer for all NICs, that is why I did not include that info. As I have done some studying about this card, apparently this card is known for this problem (or one similar, I really don't understand all the lingo).<br /><br />It still seems to me that there would be a standard something in a config file that could control this. Not that I know anything about how that stuff works, just my thoughts.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I had this problem on a realtek and I think the option was like:<br /><br />modprobe rtl8139 media=10<br /><br />But I think some cards can also be set through ifconfig so I'm not sure.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would recommend reading http://www.scyld.com/network/tulip.html. &nbsp;It has a nice table detailing the options to on the card, especially something like this for lilo. &nbsp;At the lilo/linux prompt on boot:<br /><br />lilo: linux ether=0,0,4,eth0<br /><br />Note the third parameter force the card's mediatype.<br /><br />I also found this in the newsgroups and although it is for RH 5.x, I suspect it hasn't changed too terribly much.<br /><br />C.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thank you very much. I will try and figure out what all that means and give it a shot.<br /><br />I hate having to restart my router, but if that will fix the problem, I will try it.<br /><br />The only reason it was restarted before was this same problem. The easiest way I knew to fix it was reboot. I like telling people when they are complaining about their Windows machines crashing that I have a machine that has been up XXX number of days. I am at 94 days right now.<br /><br />Thanks again.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here is the followup to this saga.<br /><br />Fortunately, the NIC was not hosed. The router hardware was not the problem. After several days of troubleshooting, I narrowed it down to a bad network cable.<br /><br />The good part of it is that I ended up with better router hardware, at least quieter anyways. My former router was my first pre-built computer. It was noisy, but a nice small package. My new router is a Dell that is very quiet. I stepped backwards in speed by 34 Mhz (now running 166 as opposed to 200), but it works fine and is nice and quiet.<br /><br />Thanks for your help. Fortunately (as is typically the case), it was not as bad as it first appeared. Though sometime it is much worse.</div>
