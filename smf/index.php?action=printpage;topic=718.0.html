					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm having a problem setting up Internet Connection/File Sharing between 2 Mandrake systems. &nbsp;My HP is running Mandrake 9.1 with an Intel Celeron 1GHz processor, 256 MB PC 133 SDRAM, &nbsp;RealTek 8139 10 Base T PCI as a rtl8139too module, and a Linksys EtherPCI II 10 Base T as a ne2k-pci module. &nbsp;My internet connection is through the RealTek as eth0 and the Linksys is eth1. &nbsp;My other system is an IBM running Mandrake 8.2 on an Intel Pentium 166MHz MMX with 16 MB of RAM, and another RealTek 8139 under a rtl8139too module on eth0. &nbsp;I want to setup basic Internet and file sharing network. &nbsp;I've tried the HOWTO's of http://www.tldp.org. &nbsp;It didn't work. &nbsp;Jesse I would say may be able to offer the most help (in my opinion) because of his quite impressive(to me) network he has setup at his home. &nbsp;But I will take any suggestions from anyone who may be able to offer some insight.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Not quite sure what you're asking here... &nbsp;Is the HP with 2 NIC's acting as a gateway/router to the Internet, and you want the IBM to go through it to get on the Internet? &nbsp;If so you'll need to play with IPTABLES for firewall/forwarding. &nbsp;Does the HP have good connectivity to the net? &nbsp;To share files between the two machines you're looking at using either Samba or NFS. &nbsp;More details please...<br />Dan</div>

I also want the File Sharing too. &nbsp;I really don't know too much about NFS or Samba..... &nbsp;I just need some help(tech and psych!!) lol</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I did this once (iptables), and it was extremely difficult for me. &nbsp;Not using it anymore as I've found a commercial router to be much simpler. &nbsp;But you'll need to do a lot of reading on &quot;iptables&quot; for you firewall, just do some google searching and there's a lot of info out there. &nbsp;Same goes for Samba and NFS. &nbsp;Samba's website is www.samba.org and it has the software and some good info.</div>
