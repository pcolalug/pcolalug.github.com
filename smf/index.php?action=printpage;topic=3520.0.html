					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just joined this group yesterday.&nbsp; I am brand new to Ubuntu.&nbsp; I recently purchased a Dell Mini with the Ubuntu operating system.&nbsp; It was actually by mistake.&nbsp; I meant to click on Windows XP in the drop down menu.&nbsp; So now I have a lot to learn.&nbsp; I am hoping this forum will be of help to me.<br /><br />My first question, is do I need anti virus and anti spyware programs?<br /><br />Thank you so much!<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi and welcome to the group.&nbsp; About your questions you don&#039;t need anti virus or anti spyware. There are no know unix viruses in the wild as they say that I am aware of and I don&#039;t know of any spyware that works on linux either. Clamav is an anti virus program that runs on linux to detect windows viruses if you have the need for that. The thing to remember about linux is to run as a user and not as root. Ubuntu is a good distro and a good one to learn the basics on. We have a security guru that will be at the meeting Thursday night so come join us if you can. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks, Ed.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what running as a user as opposed to a root means.&nbsp; I am a real newbie.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also don&#039;t know what distro is.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">In linux or unix (linux is a flavor of unix) you have an administrative account called &quot;root&quot; or &quot;superuser&quot; and user accounts similar to administrator and regular user in winxp. Linux users login with their login name to an account that does not give the user administrative privilages. That is part of the security model linux uses. As a regular user you can&#039;t change or delete system files. Root is the name of the superuser account.&nbsp; When login in as root you can do anything to your system even destroy it if you don&#039;t know what you are doing. I don&#039;t run ubuntu but I think the root account is disabled by default and to do administrative work you have to log in with a command called sudo. To learn more about Ubuntu please visit there forum where you can get better information than I can give you. A distro is short for distribution. Linux operating systems are called distributions. They are all basically the same but at the same time can be very different in respect to looks, desktop managers and included software packaging systems. Here is a link to the Ubuntu forums. This is the starting page that has a wealth of information for you. There is a learning curve to linux like all things so don&#039;t feel overwhelmed by it. Just start and learn at a pace that fits you. Ubuntu is user friendly so if you use winxp you can run Ubuntu just as easily.<br />Here is the link http://ubuntuforums.org/ (http://ubuntuforums.org/)&nbsp; </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome to the group. What Ed is saying is correct about the user account and the administator (root) account. The thing you need to know on Ubuntu is that any time it asks you for your password then you are going into root/administator/superuser mode (with the exception of the initial login when Ubuntu starts up).&nbsp; When it asks for that password I would recommend that you don&#039;t let it automatically sign in for you. That will make you think before taking the next step. I think it is a fair statement to say that there is nothing you can do as a normal user to permanantly mess up your system. Only as root can the real damage begin (and much of that can be fixed). Have few fears and enjoy the exploration.&nbsp; </div>
