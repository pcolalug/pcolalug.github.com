					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I guess Mandrake decided not to release another release candidate release of MDK10 but instead released Mandrakelinux 10.0 community. It is for download by club members now unless you want to order a DVD for 60 bucks. The download edition will be on the ftp servers shortly. This release is like a test release for everyone and the official release is to come in May. Here is the story. &nbsp;http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It doesn't seem to matter which version of KDE or which distro I use, KDE just doesn't like my computer. &nbsp;SuSE is most stable so far, but still I have had about 5 crashes in the 2 days I've been running it. &nbsp;(Not hard crashes taking down the system, just applications dying). &nbsp;So far crashes limited to konqueror and kopete. &nbsp;Is anyone else having KDE stuff crash on them (more than occassionally)? &nbsp;Do you just get used to it? &nbsp;;) &nbsp; I don't know what the deal is because KDE is apparently the most popular de going in our group (but I always have problems with it), and Mandrake is the most popular distro (I seem to always have problems with that too). We'll see if that mdk 10 can solve things for me at the installfest. &nbsp;For now - going back to my slackware gnome setup...<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've got Mandrake 10 Community installed and running here, and must say that I'm impressed. &nbsp;Everything seems to be working flawlessly right out of the box. &nbsp;Some highlights/tidbits:<br /><br />Uses kernel 2.6.3, Mozilla 1.6, Gnome 2.4.2, KDE 3.2.<br />Mandrake Control Center has been reworked.<br />Menus have been reworked.<br />Comes on 4 CD's, kernel source is included.<br /><br />Sound works, LAN works, mouse works.<br />Installed 2 network printers (using MCC/cups) painlessly and perfectly.<br />Installed latest nVidiia driver, works fine.<br />System seems to be very fast and snappy.<br /><br />Again, I'm pretty pleased with it, although have only been using it for an hour or so. &nbsp;Have not yet looked at KDE, but will soon. &nbsp;The ONLY weird thing I've seen is that my eth0 interface reports initialization &quot;failed&quot; during bootup messages, but in fact works fine. &nbsp;Gonna look into that some more. &nbsp;I will have these CD's at the Installfest if anyone wants to burn a copy... &nbsp;<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Speaking of crash... I mangled my /lib/libcrypt-2.3.3.so and my /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.7 from my 10.0 RC3 install. Could possibly send those my way please? I'm dead in the water right now without them.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I downloaded it last night, burned multiple copies for the Install Fest next Saturday and then did an &quot;Upgrade&quot; to my Mandrake 9.1 system. The upgrade took just over an hour and that included downloading and installing the Nvidia driver. It couldn't have been smoother. <br /><br />Well, time for bed. <br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I've been running mandrake 10 from the meeting on my laptop for a few days now. &nbsp; &nbsp;I'm having a weird problem in konqueror, sometimes when highlighting text in a text-box (to copy+paste) that knoqueror window will just lock up tight for about 20 seconds then resume like nothing was wrong. &nbsp;Everything else contines to function, just that particular window locks. &nbsp;<br /><br />So my question is, is there some way to do a system-update of mandrake, download patches or just get a newer version of kde for it? &nbsp;If there is an auto-update tool, what is the command to run it?<br /><br />Nick</div>
