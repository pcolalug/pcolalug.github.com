					Title: <b>The &quot;ONE&quot; Question</b><br />
					Post by: <b>Kevin</b> on <b>February 02, 2006, 06:28:52 pm</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">To destroy your mind:<br /><br />A plane is standing on a runway that can move (some sort of band conveyer). The plane moves in one direction, while the conveyer moves in the opposite direction. This conveyer has a control system that tracks the plane speed and tunes the speed of the conveyer to be exactly the same (but in opposite direction).<br /><br />The question is:<br /><br />Will the plane take off or not? Will it be able to run up and take off?<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ll post my reply and answer after a few replies.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">As a former Aerospace engineering student, I think i can answer your question.<br /><br />Lift is the upward force on the wings that allows planes to fly.&nbsp; Lift is generated by thrust.&nbsp; Thrust is generated via the air rushing through the turbines or propellers, creating an equal and opposite force.&nbsp; These are the things that allow a plane to fly.&nbsp; You must consider, the conveyor has almost no effect, as the wheels are free to rotate.&nbsp; The plane will take off.&nbsp; I would like to see a 747 on such a conveyor belt.&nbsp; LOL, after about 20 seconds the thrust from its beastly engines it will rip up asphalt, I can just imagine what it would to some flimsy conveyor belt.<br /><br />On a side note, consider this, you could VERTICALLY land an ultralight on an aircraft carrier, as you could easily match the speed of the carrier to the landing speed of the aircraft.&nbsp; Heck, you could even do it on a Big Rig!, though&nbsp; with the turbulence from the cab would be a hairy landing.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I disagree. True, the wheels on the conveyor belt have no effect per se. However, if there is no wind across the wings, the plane will not take off. A commericial aircraft&#039;s turbines can not generate enough thrust to takeoff from a stand still. The airplane does not need to roll in order to generate speed; it rolls in order to generate differential air pressure between the cambered edge of the wing, and the relatively flat edge, thus creating lift.<br /><br />I may be wrong; I am an electrical engineer, not an aerospace engineer.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I also disagree.&nbsp; The plane will not take off.&nbsp; As Kilar said, the only reason a plane takes off is the differential air pressure above/below the wing, created by the flow of air over/around the wing.&nbsp; &quot;Lift is created by thrust&quot; is absolutely false.&nbsp; The only thing the engines do in this case is move the aircraft forward (to create airflow over the wings) -- they do not lift the aircraft off the ground.&nbsp; The conveyor is most certainly relevant, as it prevents the aircraft from moving forward, thereby preventing airflow over the wings.<br /><br />Dan<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">i also disagreed at first.&nbsp; but u have to understand that the plane is not a car.&nbsp; while the conveyor belt is moving backwards, the plane, because of its thrust, is moving forward.&nbsp; the only thing the belt is doing is rotating the wheels.&nbsp; it is not actually pushing the plane backwards, because the wheels are not what&#039;s pushing the plane forward,&nbsp; so the plane is still going forward because of its propellor and/or engine, thus there is air flowing over the wings.&nbsp; the belt is completely irrelevant because it exerts no force on the plane as a whole, only the wheels.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m gonna have to go with Brent here.&nbsp; The plane&#039;s wheel rotation speed isn&#039;t necessarily tied to the speed of the plane moving forward, the only effect that such a conveyor belt setup would have is to double the speed of the wheels spinning.&nbsp; And that increases wear on the tires, yay for higher maintinence costs!<br /><br />-Ian</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don&#039;t think the conveyer belt would matter, it&#039;s the engines pulling the plane forward, reguardless of what the wheels are doing.  If the engines are pulling the plane forward at 60mph, even if the conveyer belt is moving 60mph in the opposite direction the plane should still move forward at 60mph (just the wheels will be spinning at the combined speed of the plane and conveyer belts motion).<br /><br />It&#039;s my understanding that the plane&#039;s engines provide the forward motion durring takeoff (the wheels just roll freely).  Not like a car where the wheels are doing all the work.<br /><br />I think it would go down the runway and takeoff just as if there were no conveyer belt involved.<br /><br />Nick<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Oh the irony, I have an electrical engineer and a life long navy man disagreeing with me! MUHAHAHA&nbsp; &gt;:D<br /><br />Ok, now that I&#039;ve dispensed with the small talk, let me explain further.&nbsp; The wheels are free to roll, they generate almost no friction.&nbsp; Therefore, they have no effect.&nbsp; Forget about the wheels for a moment.&nbsp; Picture the plane, magically floating on a cushion of air above a conveyor that &quot;matches the planes speed&quot;.&nbsp; Now do you see?&nbsp; As with the wheels, there is no force being excerted on the plane by the rotation of the conveyor.&nbsp; The only force being excerted is that of the aircraft engine.&nbsp; Therefore, it has the nessesary thrust to move forward, gain airflow over the wings, and take off. </div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I still disagree. Wheels, by definition have little friction, mu, but they have rolling friction, mu sub r. This is the nature of wheels. If the plane can not roll to the point where air is rushing past the wings, it can not take off. Only V/STOL aircraft take off without air rushing past the wings. Since we are not told this is a V/STOL aircraft, or that the aircraft has 80 kips thrust per turbine, we can only assume that the aircraft will sit in place with its turbines at full blast until all its fuel is consumed. <br /><br />There is no tranmission or drive axle in the airplane wheels, so anytime the engines generate thrust to propel the aircraft forward, the &quot;conveyor belt runway&quot; will oppose any forward motion of the aircraft. Thus, the aircraft can never propel itself to its takeoff velocity ~100kts. <br /><br />My answer may be wrong, but it is the best I can do with the information I have. In order for the plane to take off, I would need to make assumptions that are against my nature to assume. I still think the plane will not take off.</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thing is, the turbines connected to the engines aren&#039;t pushing against the conveyor belt, but the air above the belt.<br /><br />I understand where the belt could possibly come into play, if the belt rotated at a fixed speed, and the plane was stationary relative to it, the engines would have to bring the plane to a standstill relative to the land first, before it could move forwards.&nbsp; But, the belt and plane are stationary when it starts, leaving the engines free to pull the plane forward from the moment enough force is developed, as the plane speeds up in relation to the ground, the belt speeds up, in the opposite direction.&nbsp; Only effect here, still, is the speed of the wheels doubling.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You should have paid attention more in physics I.&nbsp; I understand though, it&#039;s very easy for our perceptions to get the better of us (thus the reason why david copperfield is still in busness).&nbsp; You must go beyond your basic instincts with this problem.&nbsp; You have to think in terms of forces acting upon the plane.&nbsp; As I have stated before, the rolling friction of the wheel excerts almost NO force on the plane.&nbsp; Here, I&#039;ll list the major forces acting upon a 747 at takeoff to help you out.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; THRUST 296 kN * 4 engines (woah)<br /><br />2.&nbsp; LIFT (derived from thrust) has to be greater than the force of gravity on the plane<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Weight (w = m * 9.81m/s^2)&nbsp; in this case 435.4 tons<br /><br />4.&nbsp; Drag&nbsp; Yes folks, at speeds above 60mph drag becomes a problem, which is why planes are aerodynamic, and why trucks have crapastic gas milage. <br /><br />5.&nbsp; (A *distant* 5th) would be the rolling friction generated by the wheels rotating at double the plane&#039;s takeoff speed.<br /><br />Now, I don&#039;t know the exact ammount of force exerted on the plane by friction, but considering it is rolling friction, it can never even approach significant levels in this context.&nbsp; The only way friction would come into play here, is if the plane were on skids.&nbsp; In that case, if the belt doesn&#039;t fail under the presure of 1184 KILO newtons of force generated by the engines, there is the possibilty that the plane would not make it airborne. <br /><br />Isn&#039;t (newtonian) physics fun? :D</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I retract my disagreement, not on the basis of the car versus airplane line of thought, but on the basis of what is being assumed. The intent of the wording is to get people to realize that an airplane does not behave as a car, but we are forced to make assumptions about the magical conveyor belt-- that it can detect the speed of anything rolling on it and match it without breaking down. If this were rephrased to say the airplane were on a frictionless surface, then it would be easy to see that the airplane would take off-- it would just slide down the surface until it reached takeoff speed.<br /><br />With the introduction of the magical conveyor belt, we are forced to assume that the belt can accelerate to inifinite speed, that the belt can accelerate before the plane can roll off, etc. <br /><br />The simplest solution, without playing &quot;what if that&quot; and &quot;what if this&quot; is that the plane will take off.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It seems that this question has been around for a long time, and highly debated.  Although I originally thought that the plane couldn&#039;t take off, I was corrected and now see the reasons why.  Here are a couple of links that reinforce what&#039;s already been said:<br /><br />http://txfx.net/2005/12/08/airplane-on-a-conveyor-belt/<br /><br />http://www.straightdope.com/columns/060203.html<br /><br />I&#039;m convinced that the plane will indeed take off...<br /><br /><br /><br />Now, with that said, I do have a couple of nitpicks with some previous comments:<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">2. LIFT (derived from thrust) has to be greater than the force of gravity on the plane</div><br />LIFT is not derived from thrust.  It comes from the differential air pressure above/below a wing, caused by airflow over the wing (the increased distance that air has to travel over the top part of the wing).  You can get that without &quot;thrust&quot;.  An example would be a model plane on the ground in a wind tunnel, tied by a string to the front of the tunnel.  If you start the wind blowing, the model will become airborne, even though it has no &quot;thrust&quot; of its own.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">4. Drag Yes folks, at speeds above 60mph drag becomes a problem, which is why planes are aerodynamic, and why trucks have crapastic gas milage. </div><br />Drag can be a problem at speeds much less than 60mph.  It is an issue at *any* speed actually, and affects an airplane from the moment it starts to move forward.  An example would be a very small single engine plane (such as a Piper Cub with a 60hp engine) which has a takeoff speed of less than 60mph.  I have actually flown one of these, and believe me, drag is an issue.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;:o<br /><br />Dan<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yes, I know how lift is generated, but since were talking about forces present, I thought I&#039;d simplify things.<br /><br />Also, I used the 60mph analogy because it&#039;s at that point where ordinary folks experience the effects of airflow in their vehicles.&nbsp; (I.e. spoilers don&#039;t really work before 60 mph.)</div>
