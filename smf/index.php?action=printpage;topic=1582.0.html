					Title: <b>Book Review: Networking CD Bookshelf</b><br />
					Post by: <b></b> on <b>April 30, 2004, 07:14:32 pm</b>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This what I posted on O'Reilly :wink: <br /><br />The title ?The Networking CD Bookshelf version 2.0? is a very accurate description. It is a bookshelf worth of networking knowledge on one CD. My only complaint is that the CD is not the same as holding an actual book and flipping the pages. Call me old fashioned, but I like the feel of a book. However, I was able to quickly get over that obstacle because there is so much information on the CD. If you had no networking knowledge but had the determination to work through these books on the CD you would gain a very solid understanding of networking. The group that will find this the most useful is the system administrator and network administrator that have not been around long enough to experience everything first hand. Also, this may come in handy for the administrators who have been around for a long time and have not kept current on every aspect of networking. They may want to consider picking this CD up. The CD makes it easy to quickly find a particular subject if you need a quick answer. This option comes in nice when you do not want to wade through a mountain of NIS information. I will use this CD very often. Great job O'Reilly</div>
