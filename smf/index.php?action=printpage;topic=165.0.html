					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, the rumors are flying. It sounds like the 9.0 final is on it's way out to the mirrors. So, keep your eyes and modems open. <br /><br />I also noticed it was very hard to get into Mandrake's main web site last night. This usually happens just before a release goes public.<br /><br />If anyone is interested, I would make a list of mirror sites now, because once it goes out, you may have problems getting to Mandrake's site.<br /><br />I expect to see/have it by the end of the week.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi everyone you don't know me but I am planning on attending your next meeting (if I can) &nbsp; Just wanted to say I love your forum. &nbsp;Now before you move my post(I hate people who post out of place for the topic don't you?) &nbsp;I actually posted here for a reason. &nbsp;<br /><br />The second almost literally that I got my email from mandrake that 9.0 final was availiable I went and started the download. &nbsp;It ran beautifully and setup in a alot less time then my &quot;other&quot; os. &nbsp;anyway I am running the gnome desktop and so far have had minimal problems although megatron wouldn't work and I don't know why. &nbsp;<br /><br />anyway look forward to posting more and receiving assistance from you experts on my MDK 9.0 <br /><br />thanks <br />Chuck</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome Wojo.<br /><br />Have you used the new Mandrake Package manager? I am not sure if there is really anything new to it, but my RC3 version is not working. I can't even get to the Package Manager. I have tried both from the K menu and from the Mandrake Control Center. Neither will start the PM for me.<br /><br />I assume that has been fixed. I did not submit it as a bug report since I installed RC3 after the final came out.<br /><br />Of course it could be a problem on my end.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I agree. Not very good. I can appreciate the fact that the guy had problems and told us about it, but if he had this many problems then I wonder if he has had these kinds of problems with other distros. <br /><br />This is supposedly an official review from Linux Orbit (http://www.linuxorbit.com). They should have tried it on another system to see if these are consistent problems or if he has flaky hardware.<br /><br />I am also a little frustrated about the wheel mouse not working. <br /><br />Did Mandrake really package Mozilla 1.1 beta? That just seems odd to me. Hasn't 1.1 been out a while? I went to &nbsp;Mozilla's website (http://www.mozilla.org) and could not tell when 1.1 was released. They now have 1.2 alpha out for testing. I would guess that 1.1 has been out for some time anyway.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think I was in the package manager just fine. and my wheel mouse works on mine. I will double check though since most of my time is spent in xp and only go to Linux to fool around so far.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I got my wheel mouse working. Just had to do the right combination of steps. The problem was that every time I selected the wheel mouse in MCC, it would flake out and do wiered things. This time it did the same thing, but I just logged out of X and then back in. Now all (most) works fine.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">dpeach: I am using 9.0rc3 and the package manager is working fine for me.<br /><br />My suggestion is to open up a console and run it from the command line, the program is &quot;/usr/bin/rpmdrake&quot;, watch for any error output and maybe that will help you track down the problem?<br /><br />Just a suggestion.<br />Nick<br />imnes@go.com</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I will give it a try when I get to that box. I have not been able to score a copy of 9.0 yet. I guess I could have downloaded it by now. <br /><br />I moved out of Mom and Dad's house where I had the DSL connection. Only over here to check mail and forums. Don't do much downloading right now.<br /><br />I believe I installed the Devel packages. I have learned that even if you are not a programmer and do no development, you still need those babies.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, in my opinion, if you have any USB devices, wait for the next version of Mandrake. They have really hosed up the usb section in 9.0.<br /><br />While my usb mouse and printer work, my usb CF reader and usb scanner don't work. Both of these devices worked flawlessly in 8.2.<br /><br />So, my recomendation is wait for the next version.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Imnes,<br />To follow up on the MCC not starting, I have done as you instructed.<br /><br />I did find the /usr/lib/perl5 directory.<br /><br />I had a few directories inside of that one. Among them, I had the two that you specifically mentioned. Inside of the vendor_perl directory I had a 5.8.0 directory with several files and directories in it, but nothing else directly in /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl. I had this 5.8.0 directory as well as the 5.8.0 inside of /usr/lib/perl5. <br /><br />I am still running RC3 on that machine.<br /><br />David</div>
