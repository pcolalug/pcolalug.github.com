					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Got a little bored yesterday and decided to give the new FC5 a look, mostly to see if Gnome 2.14 had anything exciting in it.&nbsp; The installation was routine (don&#039;t care for the partitioner wizard), and was very slow (2 hours).&nbsp; Things seemed to work fine, and I haven&#039;t seen any real noticeable changes in Gnome.&nbsp; Getting the Nvidia drivers loaded was quite a chore, due to a documented glitch in the highly modified FC5 kernel.&nbsp; Eventually found a fix with Google, but it was not a trivial task to install, and would probably not be accomplished by a newcomer to Linux.&nbsp; I expect they will fix this with a new kernel release &quot;soon&quot;.<br /><br />Anyway, it seems to run fine, and surely looks very nice.&nbsp; Default theme in Gnome is &quot;Clearlooks&quot; (modified), and things like icons and widgets, and especially fonts, are very smooth and pretty.&nbsp; It also ships with KDE 3.5.1.&nbsp; As usual with Fedora, a lot of multimedia stuff is not included (licensing issues), but can be found and installed fairly easily.&nbsp; The applications seem very much up to date.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t seen anything that really gets me too excited, and I won&#039;t be switching over to it, but it seems like a decent distro in most regards.&nbsp; If you like Redhat/FC, you&#039;ll want to give this a look.<br /><br />Dan<br /><br /><br /></div>
