					Title: <b>DVD Backup in Linux</b><br />
					Post by: <b>SiliconFOXX</b> on <b>November 05, 2004, 06:27:02 pm</b>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This thread was so I wouldn't hijack my own thread on video recording in Linux (which, by the way, I'm still playing with, no successes or failures yet).<br /><br />I'm looking to record DVD movies in Linux. &nbsp;In Windows it's pretty straightforward with programs like DVD Shrink but in Linux, until Imnes' port comes along, I don't notice us having the same &quot;easy&quot; thing to do (heh, ain't that the truth:) ).<br /><br /><br />So I've been playing around with it here and so far this is what I've come up with. &nbsp;You need to rip the DVD, transcoding, and then through this decrypted information you can size it down if need-be (the likes of DVD Shrink), and then rip the resulting files in some way (still working that bit out).<br /><br />To this end I've picked up the DVDread libraries (including the somewhat controversial one that will remain nameless) and using those and MPlayer I'm able to easily watch my DVDs now in Linux...well, with the occassional &quot;skipping&quot; but I think that'll just take a new firmware driver for the drive, I haven't updated it.<br /><br />I've also picked up two other interesting programs, though, for the transcoding. &nbsp;The first is &quot;transcode&quot; version .6 and to my understanding it's one of the more powerful ways but a bit unfriendly. &nbsp;This is where the second program comes in, DVD::Rip (sadly no Slack package yet) which apparently is a GUI for transcode.<br /><br />That all, to my knowledge, would cover ripping an exact image but as for down-sizing it such as to fit a DVD9 onto a DVD for instance or having the luxury of menus and other such features, I'm still a bit lost. &nbsp;Any suggestions on what to look for or how to go about searching? &nbsp;I'm just not entirely certain how to phrase the exact question I'm after or I'd be hunting it down right now.<br /><br />Finally, I'm assuming K3B can burn it as it supports burning DVD movies, but as to how to get whatever output I'm going to end up with from the transcode rip into a playable disk....well, haven't gotten there yet, still worrying about getting the right output first to work with. &nbsp;I'll worry about that later I suppose once I've got something to rip.<br /><br /><br /><br />So, does it sound like I'm on the right track or am I going at this totally ***backwards? &nbsp;The only guide I've found is for ripping movies to the hard drive in Linux, but doesn't discuss actually backing the movie up. &nbsp;Why go through all this trouble? &nbsp;Well for me I just love backups, to be perfectly frank. &nbsp;I'm overly protective of my CDs and DVDs and don't trust anyone, minus my wife, with them. &nbsp;To this end if someone wants to borrow, say, &quot;Fight Club,&quot; I'd much rather burn them a copy they can return than lend them the original. &nbsp;That way if the disk is never returned, broken, burned, etc no harm no foul, just $2.<br /><br />NOTE: &nbsp;I DID also get another program called VOBcopy. &nbsp;Kinda neat but I'm still not 100% positive how it fits into the &quot;big picture&quot; of DVD backup or if it fits into the jigsaw at all.</div>
