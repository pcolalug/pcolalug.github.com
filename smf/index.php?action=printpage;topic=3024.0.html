					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Greetings all!&nbsp; I&#039;m here in PCola with y&#039;all. I thought I would google Pensacola Linux Users Group and...there you were!<br /><br />I&#039;m a Linux noob, so I have a lot more to gain from y&#039;all than I have to offer. I have SuSe Linux 10.1 dual-booting with Windows XP on my laptop. After about two months, I&#039;ve figured out how to play my mp3&#039;s, wma&#039;s, DVD&#039;s, make Java work, get my 802.11g card working and get the right text size out of my print-server-connected photo printer!&nbsp; (And I just found new drivers for my ATI video chipset so Google Earth should start working better!)<br /><br />I feel like a friggin&#039; genius!!!!<br /><br />Now if I can get my cell phone to tether successfully under linux...<br /><br />Anyway, I have a schedule conflict that will keep me from making your meeting time, but if the opportunity comes I&#039;d love to meet you. <br /><br />Mark </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">lloyd,<br />verizon xv6600&nbsp; 1xrtt&nbsp; (I could do tethered with cable or bluetooth), for data access.<br /><br />And just to keep me from getting all proud of myself, I started my computer tonight and something I did yesterday broke my linux install.&nbsp; Arggghhh!&nbsp; &nbsp;Since I&#039;m command-prompt challenged, I figured out that I could get the graphics going by entering gdm. Then Nautilus wouldn&#039;t start. So I&#039;m using yast to force a reinstall of the nautilus and gnome components.&nbsp; If it doesn&#039;t work y&#039;all will be hearing from me!</div>

I don&#039;t have a bluetooth adapter so just used the usb cable<br /><br />here is my post on sprintusers forum that shows what I did to get it working using usb cable:<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">current kernel version I&#039;m running is 2.6.15.7 due to crappy ati drivers in the case of my laptop. But, built custom kernel for laptop and made sure to include USB ACM modem support (CONFIG_USB_ACM). with this and using the usb data cable that came with my A920, the phone shows up as /dev/ttyACM0 under dmesg.<br /><br />then setup the PPP by creating these 2 files:<br /><br />/etc/ppp/sprint.modem:<br />TIMEOUT 5<br />ABORT &#039;\nBUSY\r&#039;<br />ABORT &#039;\nERROR\r&#039;<br />ABORT &#039;\nNO ANSWER\r&#039;<br />ABORT &#039;\nNO CARRIER\r&#039;<br />ABORT &#039;\nNO DIALTONE\r&#039;<br />ABORT &#039;\nRINGING\r\n\rRINGING\r&#039;<br />&#039;&#039; \rAT<br />TIMEOUT 12<br />OK ATD#777<br />TIMEOUT 22<br />CONNECT &quot;&quot;<br /><br />/etc/ppp/peers/sprint:<br />noauth<br />connect &#039;/usr/sbin/chat -v -f /etc/ppp/sprint.modem&#039;<br />defaultroute<br />usepeerdns<br />/dev/ttyACM0<br />921600<br />local<br />novj<br /><br />Then, I simply ran the command &quot;pppd call sprint&quot; and watched my /var/log/messages for the modem status..... and at first, all was well, until after 2.5 minutes later, it&#039;d error out and disconnect with the message of no response to 4 echo-requests.....<br /><br />soooo, to fix that, I added these 2 lines to my /etc/ppp/peers/sprint:<br />lcp-echo-failure 4<br />lcp-echo-interval 65535<br /><br />and everything works flawlessly now. after fixing the echo-request issue, I stayed connected for around 30minutes before I disconnected the PPP session myself since I was done.<br /></div><br />this works for both 1xRTT and EVDO in the case of my samsung A920. in your case I&#039;m not sure if you will use the same #777 for data call out to use the phone as a modem. and in the case of my phone, I had to disable modem NAI since it&#039;s an EVDO phone, to keep it from showing that I&#039;m using it as a modem and not web useage just from phone (don&#039;t have tether web plan heh)</div>
