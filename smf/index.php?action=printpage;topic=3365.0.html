					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well guys I have always been a big believer in QEMU or XEN for Virtual boxes, But I am here to say that VMware server is awesome! <br />I still use QEMU and will continue to but I just installed VMware on my slackbox server which is also my desktop machine and started up Fedora8 and OpenBSD 4.2 and windows XP at the same time and each work great and can even connect to each.<br />My friend mark over at Triangle Academy is even running it on his laptop with 2 gig ram and runs great. Now most of you are probably thinking I don&#039;t need it but let me bring something up..... Security!!!<br />Start up VMware server you still have your main desktop also this is an App not an OS. Then start up your favorite OS Linux, Windows etc..... and browse the web from a secure and isolated area. Got the nieces and nephews over or the grandkids start it up and when they go just dump the image and your machine is as pristine as when you started. Need to set up an email machine for the in-laws that don&#039;t know squat real easy to reload the image! Not to mentions great place to test new live distros or even run things like servers in VM. Anyway I hope some of you will check this out and VMware server of desktop is free. Got to love that.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have been using vmplayer in PCLinuxOS for a long time now to run win98 and a few windows apps I still use. I tried an earlier version of the server and it worked well as you say. Vmplayer is free and the server used to be. Is it still free for non commercial use?&nbsp; </div>
