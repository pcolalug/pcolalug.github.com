					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">After discussing things with Marsee about a certain outstanding book that has yet to be reviewed, she suggested that we just place up a section in public to name that one person and maybe let them feel the heat of the members to get the review finished.<br /><br />So for the last string of review books, we only have 1 book not reviewed.<br /><br />Member: Mikegrb<br />received: April 16, 2005.<br />Programming ColdFusion MX, 2nd Edition<br />Creating Dynamic Web Applications<br />ISBN: 0-596-00380-3 <br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;:wink: get that review in</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just as a matter of record, I was able to contact mikegrb on the OFTC IRC network. &nbsp;I asked him if he could please post the review and he said he had it written but didn't have time to post it. &nbsp;However, he does have time to spend (all day) chatting on IRC. &nbsp;When I asked him again to please take the few minutes needed to post it, he put me on &quot;ignore&quot; mode, after some personal insults toward me. &nbsp;This all took place in a private &quot;/msg&quot; channel, which I have logs of to prove what was said.<br /><br />Several hours later, I asked him again, nicely, in a public OFTC channel. &nbsp;His response was to kick me from the channel, and ban me completely from being able to log on to the OFTC network at all (he's an IRC Operator over there). &nbsp;Again, I have logs of this.<br /><br />I think this kind of behavior is a little un-called for, since he did agree to write and post a review when he accepted the book (over 2 months ago!). &nbsp;His actions have made it so that the rest of the LUG cannot request additional review books from O'Reilly. &nbsp;Additionally, he has another LUG Library book checked out on loan, which has not been returned. &nbsp;I find this all pretty unacceptable, and am posting this in an attempt to get him to comply with his obligations. &nbsp;<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">OK, here's the log, below. &nbsp;You might want to note that I used the word &quot;a*****e&quot; AFTER you said &quot;lies&quot;, called me a &quot;psycho stalker&quot;, and put me on ignore mode. &nbsp;See that? &nbsp;Then a little bit later you call me a &quot;frik'n idiot&quot;. &nbsp;See?<br /><br />As for trying to contact you in the other channels, yes I certainly did. &nbsp;I asked if you were around, and you did NOT respond in any channel. &nbsp;So at that time I initiated the private /msg conversation you see below.<br /><br />I believe I asked nicely enough, and others have been asking you to post the book review also. &nbsp;You've had it for OVER two months, and another LUG book which is the property of the LUG Library. &nbsp;You agreed to do a review, and have not done so. &nbsp;Why are you so defensive about this? &nbsp;Why did you *BAN* me from the entire OFTC IRC network because I asked you about it? &nbsp;Huh?<br /><br />How about you post your review, which you claim to have written, but just can't find the time to post. &nbsp;Then return the two books you have which belong to the LUG. &nbsp;Then we can all move along. &nbsp;<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote"><br />Jun 24 13:09:38 danc3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mikegrb , have you checked the PcolaLUG forums lately?

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">And it amazes me that he has the time to come here and post a reply, but can't at least copy and paste the review.<br /><br />If you don't have the time to post it anywhere else, then just post it here and ask someone else to post it elsewhere. It doesn't really matter what you have going on in your life, you still have to &quot;go to work&quot; (sit on irc) and you still have to pay bills. Those are called responsibilities. You've ignored this responsibility, a simple posting of a book review that you say yourself you have written. Take the two minutes to just post it here and the group will stop bothering you.<br /><br />Oh yeah, I'm sure the other library book that you borrowed can be mailed to someone. Square up with us and we'll leave you alone. Until then, you're the one being the jerk.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, it certainly appears that Michael Greb (mikegrb) does not intend to post the book review that he agreed to do. &nbsp;I'm not sure why he's so defensive about all this, and I cannot converse further with him about it, as he still has me banned from the OFTC network (for no valid reason other than his personal grudges).<br /><br />It's a pretty sad reflection on your character and integrity, Michael Greb. &nbsp;I'm surprised that places like OFTC and Linode.com want to keep you employed with this kind of attitude. &nbsp;Perhaps that's what they like, I don't know. &nbsp;I will probably be contacting them with further inquiries.<br /><br />Anyway, it appears that you've stuck your head in the sand and won't acknowledge your behavior, and there's not much more anyone can do about it. &nbsp;You've gotten away with stealing 2 books from our LUG, I guess. &nbsp;I guess we'll be a little more careful who we deal with in the future. &nbsp;Enjoy the books, and when you look in the mirror, know that you are looking at a person with very low morals and integrity. &nbsp;It must be sad to be you.</div>

If your house is not convienent, then maybe we could meet somewhere. Also, if you have the review written, I will post it for you. Contact me by PM if you agree.<br /><br />&nbsp; Harold</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here's a little update on this situation...<br /><br />The previous ban on my ability to connect to the OFTC network was lifted, after I emailed the network senior staff about what &quot;mikegrb&quot; had done. &nbsp;I was able to reconnect to the OFTC IRC network. &nbsp;Then yesterday, things happened again. &nbsp;This time, &quot;mikegrb&quot; banned me from all the channels I was in, but not the network itself. &nbsp;Thankfully, the Linode.com company (http://www.linode.com) provides logs of it's IRC channels on it's website. &nbsp;The below quotations I make are from that publicly available log, which I will post a link to at the end of this post. &nbsp;I will be posting snippets of this log, along with comments, below.<br /><br />I would like to point out that I said NOT ONE SINGLE WORD in any of the IRC channels yesterday. &nbsp;I have snipped out the irrelevant comments by other people, and the following quotes were made by people after I had been booted out of the channel. &nbsp;This gives a pretty clear picture of the people involved here.<br /><br />Also, for reference, &quot;heidi&quot; is mikegrb's wife, &quot;caker&quot; is another OFTC channel operator, &quot;ElectricElf&quot; is a very senior OFTC staff member, and &quot;tizn&quot; is someone unknown to me.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote"><br />13:34 -!- danc3 [~danc3@ip70-191-208-195.pn.at.cox.net] has joined #linode<br />15:51 -!- mode/#linode [+b *!*danc3@*.pn.at.cox.net] by mikegrb<br />15:51 -!- danc3 was kicked from #linode by mikegrb [danc3]<br />15:58 &lt; ElectricElf&gt; I can't see any current reason why danc3 was kicked; he's said nothing in-channel<br />15:59 &lt; mikegrb&gt; this is a fellow on the network solely to harass me<br />15:59 &lt; mikegrb&gt; a fellow who I will be filing charges against<br />15:59 &lt; caker&gt; ??<br />15:59 &lt; mikegrb&gt; caker: same guy from other day<br />16:00 &lt; caker&gt; mikegrb: yeah, but he wasn't saying anything in here .. was he bothering you in PM?<br />16:00 &lt; mikegrb&gt; not yet<br />16:00 &lt; mikegrb&gt; he was waiting for me to talk</div><br /><br />So, here we see other staff members questioning why I was kicked/banned. &nbsp;Again, as you can see, I said nothing before he kicked me. &nbsp;Mikegrb seems to think I was &quot;waiting&quot; for him. &nbsp;Oh, and he's going to &quot;file charges&quot; against me.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote"><br />16:00 &lt; caker&gt; mikegrb: you didn't do your book report, huh? :)<br />16:00 &lt; mikegrb&gt; actually, I have<br />16:00 &lt; heidi&gt; a volunteer thing might I add<br />16:01 &lt; heidi&gt; and the group it is for is a hobby </div><br /><br />Here we see Mike admitting (again) that he has done the book review, but for some reason he just won't post it. &nbsp;Then Heidi jumps in with an incorrect comment that it's a &quot;volunteer&quot; thing. &nbsp;In fact, Mike agreed to do the review when he accepted the book.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote"><br />16:01 &lt; tizn&gt; mikegrb: lets find out who this guy is, I'm sure we have enough geeks in here with enough technical knowledge to get back at him<br />16:01 &lt; heidi&gt; tizn: we know him in person<br />16:02 &lt; tizn&gt; heidi: Really?<br />16:02 &lt; heidi&gt; yeah<br />16:02 &lt; heidi&gt; he is from the local lug<br />16:02 &lt; tizn&gt; hmm...

I have to send the reviews back to O'Reilly, as well as where they are posted. We will not request additional review books until all prior reviews are in.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay I give up -- what's an HRO? &nbsp;<br /><br />I'll agree with Mike on one point, these are technical books and doing a review can be tough. &nbsp;(Maybe I'm wrong, I don't know what book he got). &nbsp;But working through some of these books does take a while. &nbsp;<br /><br />If you do have the review done - good or bad - please post it here or email to someone in the LUG - or you can even post it to me on AIM or IRC or Yahoo or MSN, or on IRC gimp.net #mono sometimes. &nbsp;I've posted negative reviews, no big deal, if the book sucks let everyone know it :) &nbsp;One of us will be happy to send it out to other review sites for you, no big deal. &nbsp;The only issue here is that the LUG cannot request any more books until all the outstanding reviews are in (at least that's my understanding). &nbsp;<br /><br />I've been watching this thread and I have no clue how it got blown so out of proportion, all I hope is both sides cool down and we can move on. &nbsp;<br /><br />As far as having this thread removed - I'm not sure why that should be done, or what good it would do. &nbsp;As far as I know this site is crawled and indexed by Google, and web.archive.org, and other services. &nbsp;So it would be impossible to get rid of it completely. <br /><br />On the point of our members not knowing much about Linux - we've got a very diverse group, which I think is a positive thing. &nbsp;We have new users just starting out all the way up to coders working on device drivers. &nbsp;<br /><br />Since I don't know either side of the story personally except what's been posted here - I have no problem telling you guys, this reflects poorly on both of us, (us being Mike's group and the LUG's group). &nbsp;People are seriously threatening physical and legal action because someone didn't get a book review done on time? &nbsp;Worst case I could see someone doesn't do a review, just let O'Reilly know that someone got a book and is no longer a member for whatever reason and won't be posting a review, as long as it's not a routine thing I don't think they'd have too big an issue with it. &nbsp;<br /><br />Just my opinion, feel free to flame...<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">ok I will confirm that I received an odd box on my doorstep with no doorbell rang.<br /><br />Box contained both books that Mikegrb had, along with the review.<br /><br />Atleast that's all over with, but could have been handled a lot quicker if you just copied and pasted the review and even let someone else post it to other sites. A bit quicker than driving to milton.<br /><br />well, just confirming it arrived and the books are back in the LUG's possession.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I assume HRO is harassment restraining order, but that is just a guess. <br /><br />I have to agree with one thing though. I think in the future we should politely ask for the outstanding review(I know this was done) and if they fail to comply ask for the book back and be done with it. Someone else can always write a review and we don't have flame wars in our forums instead of linux knowledge. Like Nick said, if the member doesn't return the book or do a review I doubt O'Reilly would have any problem if we told them a member had left the group and we were unable to do a book review. Just have to be more careful who we let do book reviews in the future I suppose. Also, we should make sure anyone doing a book review completely understands when it is due and all of that. I don't know if that was actually a problem here or not, just a suggestion. <br /><br />I am glad to see that we got the book back and a review and hopefully this whole mess is over with.</div>
