					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi,<br /><br />My name is Darin Boyd. I'm actually not completely new. I went to one informal meeting over a year ago at Barnes and Nobel. I don't remeber much about it other than the fact that Rodney Landrum has an Atari tatoo.<br /><br />Anyway, I have used Linux for a while. I am an OK developer and a lousy admin. &nbsp;I am learning Qt / KDE at the moment. I also have an interest in PHP. I program in VB6 for my job. I am also familiar with C++ and Java. <br /><br />I hope to learn more about Linux admin and development from some of you. I have always been alone in my computer related endeavers, so I think it would be very good to have some sense of community.<br /><br />Anyone interested in any sort of development for Linux may feel free to contact me at any time.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yes, I'll certainly be there. I'm gaining some momentum with my Linux skills and I've been anxious to fill in the huge gaps in my knowledge. I'm hoping that the LUG will be a positive step in that direction.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome Darin. I was at that meeting you are talking about. I was there when the Atari tatoo was debuted. Let's see... I was there, Rodney, Newton, Brett, yourself and at least one other person. <br /><br />Look forward to having you at the meetings. I will not be there this weekend since I am in MI at the moment.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don't know. It depends. Did they contain a virus and hose your system beyond all repair? If so, then no I don't know what you are talking about.<br /><br />If you went home and installed Mandrake without a hitch and you are hooked on being a Linux junkie and never want to see another closed source project again in your life, then yes it was me.<br /><br />I believe that I did have a copy that I gave out that night. So it probably was.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It went fine, thanks. I'm using Redhat 8 these days, but I'll be migrating to something else in the future. I have been on the fence for a while trying to decide if I should consentrate my efforts on Gnome or KDE / Qt. I've pretty much decided on KDE / Qt since I can use C++ and the Qt environment actually works. I could never get my stuff set up properly to write Gnome Apps. Maybe after I'm a bit more Linux savy, I'll have the patience to set up that bug infested mess. Gnome 2 seems a lot faster than KDE, but it is just awful to code for and set up. I'm really weak on the admin side of things. Do you write code?</div>
