					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">A current discussion brought up an interesting point. Are Linux users in it for the free software? <br /><br />So, based on that question I've come up with a poll to see how many people actually pay for their OS and software.<br /><br />Remember to be honest. No one knows who voted and how they voted.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yes, I am interested in the free software, but I am willing to pay for good software. The problem is that I have downloaded tons of software that I would not consider good. I refuse to pay for Linux software until I get a demo version. I don't even care if it is &quot;crippled&quot; as long as I get a feel for how it works.<br /><br />On the other had I buy Windows software without demos. I expect it to work. Having said that, I realize that Windows is going to crash, but the software typically works as advertised.<br /><br />Linux is the oppposite. I know that the OS is going to work, but I am loosing hope for good (useable) software.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The only linux dist I paid for (and I don't know if this counts really) was RedHat 5, it came bundled with a book I purchased at BAM a few years back &quot;Linux Unleashed&quot;. &nbsp;I think I bought it around '97 or so. &nbsp;<br /><br />I would gladly pay for Linux if I could, but ya know - starving student and all.<br /><br />:)<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Likewise, the only Linux distro I've ever paid for is Redhat 6. &nbsp;Came in a boxed set, 2 CD's, a pair of books, and a couple of other goodies if I remember. &nbsp;Aside from that, all the Linux distro's I've used have either been downloaded myself or borrowed from someone else.<br /><br />There's a definate shortage of good quality Linux software, especially (if not (almost) entirely) for the desktop. &nbsp;Note the keyword here is 'good' -- there's plenty of crapware out there that I wouldn't pay anything for.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">My first experience with Linux was Red Hat 5.2 from a book called Using Linux. &nbsp;It really didn't like the hardware I was tiring to install it on so about six months later <br />I bought Mandrake 7.2 at Wal-Mart. It was then that I found out that Linux didn't have the best hardware support. &nbsp;Win-modems and Aureal sound cards. &nbsp;Since I got my cable modem I have downloaded several different distros. &nbsp;I also agree that it is not so much that I don't like paying for the software, some of it just seems, not ready. &nbsp;<br />I broke down and bought SuSE 8.0 in April or May of this year. &nbsp;I was severely disappointed. &nbsp;PCMCIA support didn't work out of the box. &nbsp;Customer support was poor also. All these things were fixed with SuSE 8.1, which was released in October I think. &nbsp;Which is my other problem with buying Linux. &nbsp;You buy it and the next version is out in just a few months. &nbsp;So even if it only costs me $ 30.00 for Mandrake 9.0. &nbsp;If I update every time there is a new release, Linux can get very expensive very quickly, Almost as much as that other OS. &nbsp; Don't get me wrong I think people should try it and see just what it can do. &nbsp;Sorry for the Rant. Just my $.02</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">There's a definate shortage of good quality Linux software, especially (if not (almost) entirely) for the desktop.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think pretty much everyone knows how I feel about this subject, but, just to get it on record.<br /><br />I bought RedHat 5.1, SuSE 5.0, Mandrake 8.2, Civilization: Call to Power, Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, Sim City 3000 Unlimited, and Railroad Tycoon 2.<br /><br />I also payed to join Mandrake's Club. <br /><br />I believe in supporting Linux and believe that the only way it will grow is by commercial backing. Without commercial backing there's no retail marketing and without retail marketing you miss 90% of the population. &nbsp;I would, one day, like to be able to walk into Walmart and see just as much Linux software as we currently see Windows software. This is not going to happen without financial support. <br /><br />Two of the biggest complaints I've seen about Linux are a lack of polished applications and a lack of usefull applications for the home user. This will not happen without commercialization. We have to get companies like Sierra and Broderbund and other big commercial software companies interested. This won't happen if they believe there's no money t be made in Linux.<br /><br />As you can see, I look at Linux as an Operating system rather than a link to tons of free software. Free software is the bonus but shouldn't be the decision behind running Linux. IMHO.<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, if it makes you feel better I guess I've bought one copy of linux, and I've only bought one copy of Windows (win95 when it first came out). &nbsp;<br /><br />I tried hard back then not to buy Windows, I bought OS/2 first, but it wouldn't work on my hardware so I had to take it back and trade for win. &nbsp;Oh well.<br /><br />Nick</div>
