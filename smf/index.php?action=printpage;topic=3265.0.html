					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello All,&nbsp; My name is Chance.&nbsp; I live in Panama City, this is the closest LUG I have seen online.&nbsp; Intend to be at the 15dec07 meeting. Nerd with math and science; retard with computers.&nbsp; I have been subscribing to Linux Format out of the UK for a couple of years so I get to try alot of different distros (and still have the disks and mags) if anybody wants to borrow/have any.&nbsp; My most recent blunder was disecting three OLD computers to make one better perfoming one. Now, I only have one NEW computer with an awful ugly OS(vista).&nbsp; Lots a parts around house.&nbsp; Been thinking about building my own from scratch.&nbsp; Problem is I want to build a good one and the hardware pieces are so expensive seperatly compared to the new bundles every where.&nbsp; I like Ubuntu 1 and XFCE 1, Gnome 2, KDE 3, then Fedora 2 Hotair Balloon edition (KDE or Gnome? I dont know.) The last compter I had working had ALL of these installed.&nbsp; I like variety for variety&#039;s sake.&nbsp; The main reason I like KDE the least is it is way to much like MSwindos; XFCE made my old as dirt hard ware run FAST.&nbsp; I keep getting in trouble for using OSS at work (OOo is not authorized!) I do need help with WINE I have some games I want to play but really cant do much beyond stick a new disk from Linux Format in and let it set up a partition and auto install.&nbsp; Well my email I sent to register is from work so please dont sign me up for joke of the day and junk like that.&nbsp; Bye for now.&nbsp; See ya Soon.&nbsp; --Chance</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well chance welcome to the LUG and don&#039;t worry about the emails they are kept in strict confidence.<br />Except for the occasional notice about upcoming meetings. You also get the chance to opt out of receiving them also.<br />Hope to see you at the meeting in Dec.</div>
