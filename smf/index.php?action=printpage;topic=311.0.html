					Post by: <b>rugmonster</b> on <b>December 17, 2002, 10:09:16 pm</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm using Mandrake 9.0, which I assume runs Gnome 2.0 and the window manager is the default Metacity. I have never really used Gnome because I always ran WindowMaker for my window manager, so I'm fairly lost at the moment. I am wanting to have a different background for each workspace. Is this possible?<br /><br />Also, I am guessing that some of my programs, such as Evolution, are using the older GTK+ 1.2 definitions and the Gnome font configuration tool only changes the fonts for the programs that use the GTK+ 2.0 settings. How can I change the font for those older programs? My desktop isn't very uniform...another reason why I don't really like Gnome. <br /><br />Thanks guys! And yes, I have googled for this for a few days. Please ejumikate me.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Don't know about Gnome, but KDE can have different backgrounds on each desktop.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, why Gnome instead of KDE (Mandrake's preferred desktop environment)? I am getting ready to install Red Hat 8.0. I am going to give Gnome a try for the first time in about 4 years. Since you apparently have not been using either one as your desktop, why did you choose Gnome?<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ah...this is one that is sure to spark some heated debate (if this were a different forum :P). Alright, I'll make this one short since I need to get to bed.<br /><br />I originally installed this version of Mandrake and I ran KDE, mainly because my goal was to learn a programming language and wanted to use KDevelop. I just assumed that it would run better under its native desktop environment KDE. Everything was swell, but it was so Windows-like and it just didn't feel good. Everything was too big (which is what KDE is likes...big icons, big text, big everything). <br /><br />I was working on getting domain authentication to work and decided to forget the hassel of figuring out how Mandrake had their pam setup and just did a reinstall (yes, easy way out blah blah blah). When it came time to choose a desktop environment, I initially chose WindowMaker...it was tried and true. The first time I loaded it up, it was worse looking than KDE (big bad) and I wanted more. I deleted my home directory (since it was freshly created) and then logged back in and chose Gnome...just for grins. <br /><br />Well, the way Mandrake has it setup was very pleasing initially. The layout of the panels was nice (no K menu/Foot menu or any other form of start menu wannabe). &nbsp;I was expecting the floating single panel at the bottom of the screen with everything on it, like the previous versions, but I guess Mandrake did things a little different than the norm. The pager and the &quot;task bar&quot; is at the bottom and then there is another panel at the top of the screen. Of anything, I would say it is a mix of the taskbar from windows and then the main menu bar from MacOS (prior to X). <br /><br />Overall, I have had to do less tweaking with Gnome (however somethings are just hard to tweak) and the gconf virtual fs crap sucks (wannabe registry), but the overall use seems much more fluid. If I could get my gtk 1.2 and gtk 2.0 to match up, then I would have a very nice, uniform scheme going (hence my original post). <br /><br />I have a screenshot if someone has a place I can post it so that you all can see what I'm talking about. I am very pleased with what Gnome/Mandrake has done. This setup is the best I have seen. I used to sort of scoff at desktop linux. On this laptop, I have 2k server and mdk 9.0. Before I reloaded, I was still primarily using 2k. Now that I am so happy with the desktop experience provided by Gnome, I don't think I've booted into 2k once in at least two weeks. Yes, I had to enable IMAP on our exchange server and play with the IIS permissions and Websense user authorizations to make this feasible, but it was very much worth it. <br /><br />Now, I have coworkers asking me how I got windows to look so nice...I just laugh. I have one guy in tech control who has mdk loaded on his laptop and is going through the Oreillys book Learning the Unix OS and constantly asking me questions because of him just seeing me play with it on my laptop. He has completely fallen in love with the whole idea of unix and is wanting to pursue unix admin when just two months ago was all set to go MS all the way. <br /><br />Well, this would have been short, but I always get carried away. Like I said, if someone has a webserver that I can post my screenshot to, if there is interest in seeing my desktop, I would be more than happy to email it to them.</div>
