					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I had thought about it, but looking at the screenshots, there's nothing there that isn't already available in my Mandrake/Gnome setup. &nbsp;In fact I like the way Mdk/Gnome have things set up better.<br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don't know about recent Mandrake Gnome setup's. &nbsp;It wasn't too long ago that RedHat gave you a great gnome setup and lame KDE and Mandrake gave you great KDE and lame gnome. &nbsp;I guess everybody's putting out good packages now.<br /><br />Anyone using newest Mandrake Gnome setup, post some info about it I'd like to know more. &nbsp;I haven't given Mandrake a chance in a few versions now. &nbsp;Last version I had I installed it, rebooted, and all my apps and menus were missing. &nbsp;I think most people here are using MDK so my experience must have been unique.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Nick,<br /><br />Have you recently updated Dropline at all? For some reason, my panel applet that checks for updates is always saying there are updates, but when I run the update utility it says I'm up to date. On my last update, it installed a new version of the installer, but I didn't know if I should submit a bug or not.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hey mine is doing the same thing. &nbsp;I think the applet isn't smart enough to know that your software has been updated, I think it just lets you know if new software has been released recently. &nbsp;I would give it a few days and see if it goes away by itself. &nbsp;It is kind of annoying though :)<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I dunno, anything you can tell me about it. &nbsp;Overall impressions. &nbsp;What do you really like about? &nbsp;Anything you really wish they'd change? &nbsp;Do you know if they've done anything to make it different / &nbsp;better than stock gnome 2?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, my overall impression is outstanding. &nbsp;I don't have a whole lot to compare it to, as I've used MDK for most of my Linux experience so far, but I can say that I like it MUCH better than Redhat 8/9 versions (Bluecurve modification). &nbsp;I also like it much better than KDE, which seems too &quot;busy&quot; to me and has too much clutter.<br /><br />One thing I do really like is the various setup utilities packaged by Mandrake, most of which are contained in the &quot;Mandrake Control Center&quot;. &nbsp;Very easy to use and they work. &nbsp;I do some of my configurations by hand with an editor, but for some things these tools are easier. &nbsp;I also like the Nautilus file manager very much. &nbsp;The other menus include the usual collection of apps, which I suspect is pretty much stock Gnome 2.2. &nbsp;Overall it seems fast, organized well, and it just works.<br /><br />I will try to post some screenshots of Mandrake Control Center if I can find some time this weekend. &nbsp;I'd recommend you try it if you are thinking about switching distros. &nbsp;The &quot;urpmi&quot; software function is really slick and makes upgrading things easy.<br />Dan</div>
