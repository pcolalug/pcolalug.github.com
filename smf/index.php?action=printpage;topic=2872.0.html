					Post by: <b>rugmonster</b> on <b>May 14, 2006, 09:37:26 pm</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I just saw today that Kororaa is being accused of violating the GPL (http://kororaa.org/index.php?entry=entry060512-160752) with their Gentoo-derived XGL LiveCD (http://kororaa.org/static.php?page=static060318-181203) by including the Nvidia and ATI binary drivers with the distribution. Visit the link, read the reasons listed and share your opinion. I&#039;m curious what everyone thinks.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This opinion piece at OSNews.com (http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=14616) puts some insight into the Kororaa/GPL debate. Read it over. I&#039;m seriously curious what everyone thinks about the binary drivers and proprietary code being introduced to our FOSS environments. Any purists around?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Beats me.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a lawyer or a developer, just a user.&nbsp; The first version of Mepis Linux I used (2003.10) automagically included the nVidia driver for my machine.&nbsp; In subsequent versions, it has not, and the nVidia driver has to be installed manually.&nbsp; Mepis, IIRC, was accused of a GPL violation on a separate issue, specifically, the source code of its installer.&nbsp; After reading up on it, that seemed like a dubious accusation to me. Opinions seem to vary. <br /><br />I notice that nothing&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried lately has ATI or nVidia drivers compiled in it, they have to be installed separately.&nbsp; The same is true even of PC-BSD, which is largely under the BSD liscence (some GPL, stuff-all apps, I think)-and that notwithstanding the nVidia statement cited on the Kororaa site.&nbsp; It&#039;s not much of an issue for me on an everyday basis.&nbsp; Most of my desktop use has no call for 3d accelleration anyway, unless you count the &quot;Euphoria&quot; screensaver which is a POS w/out accelleration.&nbsp; I installed the most recent beta of Mepis 6 last Sunday &amp; haven&#039;t bothered to install the nVidia driver yet. Don&#039;t know that I will as I may erase Mepis in favor of Ubuntu 6.06 (Dapper) when it is released (the betas have been buggy for me), and I&#039;m going to put FreeBSD 6.1 on one partition and and Open BSD 3.9 on a second--if I can get the latter installed &amp; working.<br /><br />Were I a potential Windows migrant, I&#039;m sure I&#039;d want them.&nbsp; Actually, I&#039;d like to see XGL/Compiz in action, but my older box doesn&#039;t support SSE instructions and the newer is AMD64, for which I&#039;ve yet to see instructions--not that I&#039;ve looked real, real hard.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think the bigger question has more to do with whether or not we should use non-free code on our systems. If we allow Nvidia, ATI or anyone else close off the code from us (the community), we are in reality facing the same thing we all face in Windows or other closed OS. We don&#039;t really know what&#039;s going on. This isn&#039;t to say we all look at the code of every program we run, but I have had programs break and I&#039;ve been able to track down the problem, fix it, recompile and submit a bug report. If something breaks, won&#039;t run and has a vulnerability inside these drivers, we can&#039;t do anything about it. We are once again opening the door to being at the mercy of a commercial intentity.<br /><br />I think anyone switching from Windows should understand that Linux and the vast majority of the software running on it is made under certain principles. You get what you pay for and I believe you level of expectation should be about the same. If Linux, or any other OS or software for that fact, fails to meet your expectations, then go look elsewhere.<br /><br />I say this and I run the Nvidia drivers right now and I plan to continue to. I&#039;m just exploring the idea of a potential slippery slope. A little tangent from the original topic, but I believe this is the core issue motivating the anonymous author of the notice to Kororaa. Whether she is correct or not, I don&#039;t know.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">An update from Koroaa (http://kororaa.org/index.php?entry=entry060521-200059) on where this stands. Raises some insightful looks at the GPL and the bundling of the non-GPL, binary drivers and whether or not doing so is in violation of the GPL. Well worth reading.&nbsp; </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You are right about the bigger issue being whether or not we are going to allw non-free code on our systems.&nbsp; IMHO, it is almost certainly a slippery slope, and we could end up at the bottom of the slope only marginally better off than Windows users.&nbsp; The binary blobs could contain anything, really.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t take a lot of Googling to see that it&#039;s the OpenBSD folks who are taking the most militant (or at least loudest) stand in this matter.&nbsp; &quot;Anti-Blob &quot; is sort of the theme of their 3.9 release. <br /><br />Link to an OpenBSD user blog (?) http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&amp;sid=20060519194122&nbsp; That post drew some interesting commentary (both pro and con) as well as this link to a hypothetical scenario at the bottom of the slope:. http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0512.0/0972.html.<br /><br />You may have also seen the Kernal Trap interview with Theo deRaadt who had interesting revelations and observations as to which h/w vendors supply documentation adequate to produce open source drivers and why: http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0512.0/0972.html.<br /><br />It is impossible to over look the big red swirl under your name.&nbsp; Debian, too, takes a highly principled stand against binary blobs, too, does it not?&nbsp; There was a bit of a discussion on blobs in Debian last year, with the conclusion that they belonged in non-free, from this thread: http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/04/msg00047.html.&nbsp; Actually, I got more Google hits on &quot;Debian + binary blob&quot; than &quot;Open BSD + binary blob.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Fortunately for me, nothing I do with Linux or the BSDs as a home user requres h/w accelleration.&nbsp; I have been using Sarge off and on since it was still testing, Ubuntu, for example, is flashier, but not substantively better than Sarge for me--except on this box (amd64), which I hope the release of Etch will address.&nbsp; <br /><br />With respect to expectations, I&#039;m not so sure many Widows users have very high expectations anymore.&nbsp; Most folks I know use their home boxes for e-mail, research &amp; surfing, all of which are just as easy -and much safer-on Linux or FreeBSD.&nbsp; (Personally, I consider the lack of built-in Flash support a plus when researching/surfing.)&nbsp; Most of my friends, who are in their 50s (like me) or older seldom bother with games anymore.&nbsp; Were it possible to persuade more of them to at least try an open source O/S, many of them could easily switch.&nbsp; My 2¢. <br /><br />Interesting topic. Bedtime, for me, though.<br /><br /></div>
