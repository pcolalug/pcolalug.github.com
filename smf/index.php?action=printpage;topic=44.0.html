					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well it looks like Mandrake has released an update kernel for it's distribution. The update is suppose to fix some problems including security.<br /><br />I was just wondering what everyone's thoughts are on installing this update.<br /><br />My personal opinion is that my system is running fine, this doesn't add any features I need, and I'm behind a firewall, so why bother? Everytime I've installed a kernel it's been a real hassle. You're altering a major portion of your system and it may or may not run back up. Personally, I'm waiting for 2.4.19 to be released so I can get the new Via ATA 133 drivers installed. <br /><br />So, any other opinions? Has anyone already installed this latest update?<br /><br />Steve</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">My machines sit behind a firewall, so I'm not really gonna gain anything by having the latest security patches. &nbsp;If your machine was a web server or something then I could see installing for that reason.<br /><br />If you aren't having any problems then I say do not update the kernel. &nbsp;Especially if you'd have to custom build the kernel (I don't know if the updates are pre-built or not). &nbsp;But building a modularized kernel on a redhat derived distro is a bit of a pain, usually takes me a few tries before I can get everyting working happily.<br /><br />So I would have to say, if it 'aint broke don't fix it. :-D<br /><br />Nick</div>
