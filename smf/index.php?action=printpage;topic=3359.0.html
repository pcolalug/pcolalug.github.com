					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don&#039;t know about you but one of the biggest annoyances to me in Linux has been a really good wireless connection manager that will handle wpa and allow me to see all the possible connections and even handle wired connections.<br />Well I have finally found it is called Wicd and I was first introduced to it in the latest BT3 live cd and fell in love with it.<br />the link can be found here. http://wicd.sourceforge.net/ (http://wicd.sourceforge.net/).<br />Let me know if you have any problems I had a minor issue with it in Slackware but was able to resolve it quickly with Google.<br /><br />Wow I am on a roll now I have also found Wireless Assistant that is the default manager on Back Track 3 and it works really well also.<br />I have installed it flawlessly on slackware as there is a slackpkg for it along with most other distros. the tool from command line is called wlassistant. IT can be found here. http://wlassistant.sourceforge.net/ (http://wlassistant.sourceforge.net/)<br />Hope that helps some of you.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Oddly enough,&nbsp; I have been having&nbsp; a problem with knetwork manager in kubuntu.&nbsp; From my research, I have found a lot of people are having problems with Knetwork manager and end up installing wicd.&nbsp; I believe I am going to install it as well.<br /><br />Lee</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I installed wicd this morning and it is working without a hitch.&nbsp; I did read where you needed to uninstall knetwork manager first.&nbsp; &nbsp; I installed wicd from the command line via apt-get and it automatically uninstalled knetwork for me and then installed wicd.&nbsp; I have been able to connect to the wireless access points that I was unable to connect to with knetwork manager.&nbsp; The problem I was having with knetwork manager was that when i had to set static ip&#039;s up It would never work.&nbsp; DHCP would work flawless.&nbsp; I am not having the problem with wicd.&nbsp; I did read where others were having the problem in mixed dchp / static ip environments.&nbsp; I recommend checking it out dpeach if you are having a problem with knetwork manager.<br /><br />Lee</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I used the instructions found at this page (http://wicd.sourceforge.net/download.php) and installed it for Kubuntu/Ubuntu hardy. The one network I have connected to worked fine. I am curious to try it out as I travel and hit all kinds of hotel configurations. I mostly use a wire if available though.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">As long as I was in a dhcp environment I was ok with knetwork manager.&nbsp; If I was in a situation that I had to use static, I would always have a problem.&nbsp; I have not had that problem at all with wicd.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I tried the wicd but with my Realtek 8187b USB wireless, even when the driver is loaded in ndiswrapper and hardware present, it still refuses to see any wireless network, and I know in Windows it shows at least 4-7 from my computer room.</div>
