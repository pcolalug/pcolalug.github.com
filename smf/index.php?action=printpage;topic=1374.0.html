					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hola,<br /><br />Is there any cost effective local MCSE training in Pensacola, or should I just do Smart Certify? I'm finally going to hunker down and get certified after all these years. :)<br /><br />Regards,</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don't know anything about PJC's program, but I have a friend that is taking the courses there. He is not the sharpest knife in the drawer, but they let him into the program. So I would imagine that they make it pretty easy. He says that it is a 5 week program with 9 hours of class time each week.<br /><br />Again, I don't know any more than what I have just written. Just wanted to let you know that they have something going there.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just out of curiosity, how hard is the MCSE series of tests? I have resolved that in the next couple of years, I will get the MCSE for no other reason than to have it on my resume. My tuition assistance will pay for one certification including training and I was thinking about using that on the MCSE since I have little doubt I will need classes for the CCNA/CCNP, Solaris or LPIC, all of which I plan on getting before I get out.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Many thanks Dave! I'll check out PJC's site. &nbsp;I think I'll sneak into the Pensacola Dot.Net meet coming up, get some insights.<br /><br />Respectfully yours,</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Our MCSE program is college credit and consist of 6 courses that must <br />be taken in sequence. &nbsp;The courses are in an accelerated format of 5 <br />weeks: &nbsp;during the fall or spring term you take 3 classes of 5 weeks each. &nbsp;<br />This enables you to complete in 2 terms, less than one year. &nbsp;If you <br />are only wanting the MCSE training for the certification, you need to <br />have a good background in computers and networking to be exempt from the <br />prerequisites.<br /><br />This fall (August 2004) we will offer the first three courses in the <br />morning and the second three courses in the evening. &nbsp;Then in the spring <br />the first three courses will be offered in the evening and the second <br />three courses in the morning. &nbsp;If you are able to go in the morning from <br />8:00 to 9:50 Monday thru Friday, you could start in August. &nbsp;However, <br />if you have to work in the days, you could start the evening courses in <br />the Spring (January 2005).<br /><br />One of our advantages, other than the courses being college credit, is <br />the cost. &nbsp;Our courses are $55.70 per credit with a $25 lab fee per <br />course. &nbsp;The total cost of our program is $1,152.60 plus books. &nbsp;<br />Additionally, you get hands on lab training in loading, configuring, setting up, <br />etc. the various operating systems.<br /><br />This looks very good to me, esp about the college credit, the price, and the hands on, which online wouldn't give me. I think the camaraderie of other peeps being in the same boat would also help w. future networking opptys in the future, as my previous college experience was able to provide. &nbsp;What do ya'll think?</div>
