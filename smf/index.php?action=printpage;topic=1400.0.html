					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I use Mandrake as my primary desktop but I still would not recommend it to most people I know. I just don't think it is polished enought for main stream windows users. Linux needs a home user database application and multimedia is too complicated for most windows user to install the necessary addons for playing regular DVD's and playing windows media and realplayer files on the internet. A lot of the applications need polish. An example is ximian evolution mail program. The windows open up with parts sticking off the moniter screen and some of the urls in an email don't work for lack of knowing what the protocol is. Also gnome and kde both have to be install to use the &quot;better applications&quot;. Right now for most windows users I would recommend mac ppc's.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">hmm, with slackware and dropline gnome all video types just work out of the box. &nbsp;I was missing some windows codecs, the video player downloaded and installed them as needed. &nbsp;Real player installs and works fine. &nbsp;I also don't have a problem of apps starting off the screen. &nbsp;I only have gnome installed, no kde apps or libs at all. &nbsp;The only thing I'm missing is a nice burning program, but dropline is working on that too. &nbsp;Until then I can burn regular data disks from the file manager just like win XP users.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">i would also have to agree with imnes on this one...... I use slackware 9.1 and dropline gnome on 3 main p4/p-M systems and slackware with fluxbox or normal gnome on a few other systems.....slackware+dropline is a winning combo as far as things working straight out....the only thing was cd burning but because I have kde libs loaded, i use K3B which blows nero away....and if u want something for extremely simple drag and drop burning, nautilus cd creator is about as simple as you get &nbsp;:lol: <br /><br />but as far as things requiring both kde and gnome to be installed to work.....no, the only app that loads with kde libs for me is K3B and we use all the systems heavily.... and I also have xine and mplayer loaded as far as video playing and i thats only because i like expirementing with each...but both work great for any video type whether it be realplayer, wmv9, mpeg, or any other type..... and for email, i've always used mozilla mail and never had a problem in all the years i've used it....ximian evolution i've seen and used but mozilla mail works just fine for me and never had problems with it.....<br /><br />for me it's gotten to the point where I only can really stand linux apps and much more adjusted to using the apps on my slack systems....including running a linux live distro for school when i use the systems....and i've noticed it's rubbed off on a few friends who are now running either mandrake, suse, or currently using a live distro until they get more adjusted to the environment.....but the good thing is these people have been using windows the entire time they had a computer and are impressed with the apps and everything in linux</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, my view on multimedia for linux has changed. I just installed mplayer and got dvds to play, windows media and a whole host of other video files. I was very very impressed. I still don't think linux as a desktop is ready for my Grandmother, who has a hard time with MacOS X, but it is coming along.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The article was about linux being ready for the average windows user. You guys are experts and can setup a good system and install the codecs and libraries that are required to get things working. That is not the case with a windows user who has just installed a linux distro for the first time. There are a lot of little tweeks that you do to get things working and don't give it a second thought. It would be a good experment to have a windows only user come to one of our meeting a have him/her set up a distro or do several different one to see which is easiest to do.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">imnes, you make a good point to this whole discussion:<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">But I guess it doesn't matter, most non-techie people won't like having to install windows any more than they would like having to install linux.</div><br />Your average Windows user that would not like running Linux has never even installed Windows. And that would be the sticking point. My Grandmother would not run Linux (neither of my Grandmothers really know what a computer is, so this is just an example) because she would not know how to install it. <br /><br />If it was set up, like most people receive their Windows machines, then it would be much easier for her. Until people can easily buy Linux pre-installed on a machine, then it will not hit critical mass in the home market.<br /><br />I think the important area to start is getting businesses using Linux. As users have it at work, then they can start taking it home and making it their home system.<br /><br />All in all, I don't think Linux is ready for the home user just because the average user has never installed an OS. Not that Linux itself is not ready (which I don't think it is), but because people don't want to have to install thier own OS.<br /><br />I had a question about mplayer, ruggy. Does it play the DVD menus? I was told that it does not, it just plays the movie. I have not tried it as a DVD playback program, I have used Ogle, which does handle the menus just fine.</div>
