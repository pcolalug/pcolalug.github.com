					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay now that I have two working window managers of the same vintage (latest version of each) I can fairly compare them.<br /><br />I gotta say, first impression is Gnome has gotten a lot faster. &nbsp;And KDE has gotten a lot slower (or maybe it stayed the same but just feels slower now compared to gnome).<br /><br />Not taking any distro specific customizations into account, KDE has tons and tons of programs included with it and the menu structure is kind of a mess. &nbsp;On the other hand Gnome continues to strip down their apps offering to the essentials.<br /><br />Their respective browsers (Konqueror and Epiphany) get the job done equally well. &nbsp;As said before, gnome's epiphany starts a lot quicker than konqueror (which isn't exactly slow either). &nbsp;But once loaded they both perform equally well. &nbsp;Konqueror still has some rendering issues on sites I frequent but the situation is improving thanks to apple porting their work back to kde.<br /><br />File managers, again gnome's nautilus starts faster than konqueror file manager. &nbsp;To me that's amazing because when nautilus first showed up it was the slowest thing on my computer (next to Netscape 6). &nbsp;Nautilus starts instantly on my machine, it throws up a display with generic icons quickly then works on generating thumbnail previews of everything in the background - but you have something to work with instantly.<br /><br />I'm using only KDE right now trying to get a feel for the apps that come with it. &nbsp;Gnome Office officially is baiscally Open Office plus a few more apps. &nbsp;We all know open office is big and slow, but works great. &nbsp;The minimal office apps that come with gnome are AbiWord and Gnumeric, both very fast and work fine (for me). &nbsp;I haven't gone through KOffice yet but I hope to this week and post my thoughts on it later.<br /><br />I use 3 PDF viewers in linux. &nbsp;Official Adobe Acrobat, Gnome PDF, and the KDE offering (KGhostView I think). &nbsp;Adobe is good when the others don't rendering something correctly but is ugly to look at and doesn't support scrolling with a wheel mouse (although it does do antialiased fonts well). &nbsp;Gnome PDF looks good and supports the wheel mouse, but won't scroll to the next page, you can only scroll within one page, then you have to hit the &quot;NEXT PAGE&quot; button on the tool bar. &nbsp;True pain in the but. &nbsp;KGhostView works exactly as I expect they all should, scrolls continuously through the entire document. &nbsp;I like it.<br /><br />Games? &nbsp;All the games in KDE and Gnome suck. &nbsp;What can I say. &nbsp;If you're a big fan of Solitaire then maybe they're good for you... &nbsp;<br /><br />One of my favorite features of gnome seems to be gone. &nbsp;The ability to burn CD's from the nautilus file browser. &nbsp;It worked great for me so I don't know why it dissapeared. &nbsp;(Maybe it's still there just hidden away). &nbsp;There's no other real CD Burning apps for gnome which is kind of strange. &nbsp;Lots of choices for KDE though. &nbsp;I used k3b (didn't come installed but I downloaded it since you all seem to like it). &nbsp;Worked fine, very easy to use.<br /><br />And just to flip tables for the other side, there's no good instant messaging software for KDE. &nbsp;Gnome has gaim which is just great at what it does. &nbsp;I'm not a big fan of mixing apps, I tend to want to use gnome apps in gnome and kde apps in kde, but that's one I'm using in both places.<br /><br />One thing which the linux desktop's seem to have (finally) agreed upon is a media player. &nbsp;Of course KDE in it's typical style has about 5 media players to chose from, but they're going with xine as their main player now (which gnome previously went to). &nbsp;In KDE you get the regular xine, gnome has bundled a GTK specific interface with it (in the typical style of gnome, stripped-down and free of 'features' that are not usually needed.)<br /><br />And one very important issue (since I'm only have a laptop right now). &nbsp;I get 3+ hours of batter life in Gnome, and only about 2 hours in KDE. &nbsp;Why the huge difference? &nbsp;Wish I knew. &nbsp;My CPU is at 100% idle when I'm sitting in gnome not doing much, but doing the same in KDE I only idle about 92%. &nbsp;<br /><br />That's it for now I gotta go to class, <br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have always preferred Gnome over KDE, but that is mainly for the fact that it has always seemed cleaner. I don't like large cartoonish icons and window managers. I know there are simple themes for KDE and wonderful things like Karamba, but Gnome just seems to work more. Also, KDE does seem slower. When I get my new system put together, I think I'll be using Gnome again.<br /><br />Oh yeah, Randall, I don't want to hear your crap on how QT is so much better to code for. :wink:</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Don't worry ruggy, you won't :P. But I will say that while Gnome is nice and all, I'll stick with KDE. The version (straight from the horse's mouth save for some backgrounds and icons) that you get with Gentoo is clean, fast, and featureful (especially with prelinking). One thing that keeps me comimg back is the configurability of KDE. There's just more stuff to play with, I guess.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm with ruggy. &nbsp;I tend to stay with gnome for the same reason - nice clean interface. &nbsp;What's with all the gradients in KDE? &nbsp;And why does konqueror need 18 buttons on the toolbar :)<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">OK I have them all loaded and you are tight KDE is so slow and why look in the background it has twice as many jobs going on as gnome.<br />As far as buck for the bang Gnome is the way to go...<br />I myself use Sawfish which is a gnome version and it runs even faster than default gnome.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The &quot;nice, clean interface&quot; argument is a valid one, I guess. Personally, I think KDE is just as clean, and if its too cluttered, well you can always change that. Besides, clean is one thing, but some stuff in gnome (like the file dialog) are a little *too* sparse for my tastes.<br /><br />Ininit great we have all of these choices? If you really want to get lean and clean, the new version of xfce (http://www.xfce.org) looks pretty nice too.</div>
