					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well guys day three here at SANs in Pensacola. Nice turnout 15 people for the class.<br />Really enjoying it. Learning a lot about digital forensics. Great set of tools and tons of case material. <br />BTW it has been found that now that one pass with zero&#039;s is enough to make data non recoverable from harddrives.<br />This is the new mil spec standard. I will still use three wipes but so far we have been unable to retrieve files after wiped.<br />Today we actually pulled deleted data from our test images. We are using vmware workstation for our test labs.<br /><br />More to come later need to get back to class.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi Brett, Are you saying that the pros can&#039;t retrieve any data off a hard drive if you wipe it with zero&#039;s on one pass. What about doing a low level format not the quick format does that not make the old data unrecoverable. I hate to see good hard drives destroyed because of the data they contain. I like to recycle and destroying good hard drive seems such a waste to me.<br />Ed </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am saying the FBI who is here with me can not recover after writing the entire HD with zeros once.<br />We are using all the top tools and have been unable to recover a single byte of data. Once the data is deleted but allocated it has been written over.<br />So yea I will be letting our clients know that also just for you.<br /><br />btw Mr. Ed did you get one of those small form factors working?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well last day of SANS. I look forward to putting together a little presentation for the lug!<br />Perhaps next month since we have a lan party this month.<br />I can go over some&nbsp; of the open source tools available to delete and recover data.</div>
