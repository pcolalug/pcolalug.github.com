					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This lost all its formatting when I pasted it in, but you can get the formatted version at the first link below.<br /><br />Basically it is a program where you can get ebooks and videos for free from O&#039;Reilly in exchange for a review. We have not done much with the free books for review program lately. I thought this might be of interest to some of you so you can deal with O&#039;Reilly directly instead of going through a mediator.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">If you cannot read the information below, click here. http://post.oreilly.com/rd/9z1zdbggap1bcomud10lqj7r1pp30tfq3bjgas2krr0<br /><br />O&#039;Reilly.comUser Group Newsletter<br /><br />Nov 2010 Issue<br /><br />New Releases:<br /><br />iPod: The Missing Manual, Ninth Edition<br />By J.D.
