							<div class="post">Well, now that I have spent 4 days of my life totally frustrated with Gentoo again, I thought I would air my comments. I know that I have mentioned all of this before in different places, but maybe we can keep it together and teach me something.<br /><br />I have to start by saying I was prejudiced against Gentoo the first time I tried it. Therefore, I did not really give it a fair trial. This time though I was very excited about it and wanted it to work.<br /><br />(If you are not familiar with Gentoo or my previous rants, skip to the ** section below.)<br /><br />I checked MD5sums, so my discs should be fine. I followed the guide that the installation pointed me to both on the CD <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoo-x86-install.xml" target="_blank">and the net</a>. <br /><br />My first problems came when I was to edit /etc/make.conf and /etc/fstab. nano would not work. By this point in the installation you are supposed to be chrooted into the new system. From the chrooted system I could not run nano. From another console on the RAM drive, I could use nano just fine. But I did not know how to save the file back to the real system.<br /><br />A couple of phone calls later and I had a brainstorm. We had tried to emerge nano onto the system and it still would not work. So, on my own I actually figured out how to emerge vi. I was able to emerge that and edit my files. So after that little snag I was on my way again.<br /><br />Time to compile the kernel. I know that genkernel is both experimental and controversial. But I thought I would give it a try anyway. When I emerged genkernel I got version 3.0.xbetax (x meaning I don't remember the exact number). The instructions tell me how to use genkernel versions 1.2 and 1.4. Version 3 is quite a few versions after 1.4, at least I would assume. Needless to say, it did not work as it was advertised. I could not get anything to work with genkernel the way the instructions said. Tried doing some figuring out on my own and it seemed that doing genkernel all from my kernel source directory was the way to go. It seemed to do something, but in the end (I forget how much time later) kernel compile failed with no messages. <br /><br />Start all over, again.<br /><br />I tried everything up to doing genkernel one more time. Still failed without messages.<br /><br />Then it was time to compile without using genkernel. I used the cd &quot;/usr/src/linux &amp;&amp; cat /proc/config &gt; .config &amp;&amp; make oldconfig&quot; method. There were alot of questions that it asked that I had no clue about. I answered no to most of them unless I knew that they needed a yes. I missed a yes one time so had to go all the way to the end and start over. Went through the compile and everything worked. Finally something worked the way it was supposed to.<br /><br />I then finished up the installation and rebooted to see if it all worked. It did! Woohoo!<br /><br />Then I tried to install Xfree86 using the <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/desktop.xml" target="_blank">instructions from the web again</a>. I did &quot;emerge xfree&quot; as instructed and went to bed. I woke up the next day to &quot;failed without messages&quot; (or something like that). I then tried it again just to make sure. Same thing. I ended up trying 2 more times that day. Same results. I thought maybe the Windows way would work. You know, never expect the same results twice. So I thought if I did it enough I would finally get the results I wanted.<br /><br />After talking with rburt3 I tried doing &quot;emerge -u --deep world.&quot; According to him it would &quot;just take a few minutes&quot; since it was a &quot;fresh install.&quot; Well, it tried to emerge 35 programs. Needless to say, I went to bed again hoping to wake up with a new start on Sunday. I woke up to &quot;failed without messages&quot; again. It was on some unimportant program named gcc. I don't know alot about compiling, but I do know that you go nowhere without gcc. So I tried the --deep world again and it said 23 packages to emerge. Well at least it got 12 of them the night before. I left for a few hours and returned to &quot;failed without messages.&quot;<br /><br />I tried compiling gcc by itself. No success.<br /><br />I then tried doing emerge --deep x, but it asked me x what. So I did the xfree again (was told by rburt and cntlz that x by itself should get it). Still failed with no messages.<br /><br />What are all these &quot;failed without messages&quot; supposed to do for me?<br /><br />**I understand that Gentoo has some great advantages. Briefly, as I understand them. You compile your own custom kernel. You don't have extra junk cluttering up your kernel. When you compile all of your software (as opposed to precompiled binaries) you get software that should run on your system optimally. You have no unnecessary bloat and overhead (unlike Windows which is mostly bloat and overhead). So you are getting a custom system all the way around.<br /><br />The downside of this? Add new hardware, recompile your kernel. I guess some people like to do this every couple of days anyway, so why not? Everything is compiled from source. You don't just decide you want to install something to check it out. It could be a several hour process depending on many factors. Something that will take me 2 hours to compile might take you 6. Not everything takes that long though, I have compiled individual programs in 20 minutes or so.<br /><br />My two main complaints with Gentoo are these though. I don't like <b>having</b> to compile everything. I would like a choice. And secondly, I do not like the dependency on the Internet to install the system. With the final release of 1.4 they have made it possible to download a 2 CD set and get everything you need on them to get you going without having to download more from the Internet. I have not personally tried that since I have broadband now. But for the millions of people who can touch the Internet and get their hands on Gentoo or other Linux installation CDs, the vast majority do not have broadband connections. Which is really the only feasable way to use Gentoo.<br /><br />Gentoo is very appealing in theory, but in practice it seems to have a long way to go. I could have installed Mandrake 9.2 30 or more times in the amount of time it took me to finally get frustrated enough with Gentoo to move on (I may give it one more shot, but don't hold your breath). And with my 30+ installations of Mandrake in this time period, I would wager that 28 or more of them would install without problems.<br /><br />I have known compatable hardware. Everything in that box works with Mandrake 9.2. I expect it to work with Gentoo as well. Especially since Gentoo has positioned itself to be bleeding edge.<br /><br />Gentoo reminds me of my early days of playing with Linux where I would spend a week trying to install a distro, before moving on to something else. That is so 90's. You know, the dark ages. I am done with those days and ready to move on. One thing that keeps Linux out of the mainstream is distros that make it difficult to install. <br /><br />In defense of Gentoo. Not everyone has to run it. Nor does it advertise itself as a Newbie Distro. I realize that. Therefore, for you people that like to recompile nightly snapshots of your favorite software every day, Gentoo is for you. For those of us that would just like to use our box to get stuff done, I think I will look another direction.<br /><br />With flame suite on and well prepared,<br /><br />David, &quot;The anti-Gentoo&quot; Peach</div>

							<div class="post">Fair enough, dpeach. Sorry your experience wasn't a good one. Just wanted to correct some things (no flames intended).<br /><br />Gentoo can and is used as a binary distro. In fact, the default settings create binary packages for everything you emerge (so you could just install the packages on similar hardware without having to re-compile). I believe you can install most software for Gentoo from binaries.<br /><br />Just because we &quot;can&quot; compile all of our stuff every hour of every day doesn't mean we have to. I can't tell you how much time I spend every week compiling software because it really doen't register. Once a week I switch over to a terminal, enter 3 or 4 short commands (should really write a bash script) and then switch back to my desktop and forget about it while the system updates the nessesary programs (from source, too!).<br /><br />Yes, Gentoo is geared towards the &quot;roll your own&quot; mentality. It is because of this that the documentation for things like binary package management is so sparse. It really is a great system if you want to learn how a distro is put together and want to know everything that went into making your OS, or you need to roll a special purpose install with only the features you need.<br /><br />Oh, and as for having to recompile the kernel every time you add new hardware, this is true if you compile stuff into the kernel instead of as modules. Now, I do compile into the kernel and only the things I need for my system, so I would indeed have to recompile my kernel to add new hardware. However, this is just because of how I choose to build my kernels, not because its the &quot;Gentoo Way(TM)&quot;.<br /><br />dpeach, I'm sure if we could coordinate a time, I (and probably a few others) would be more than happy to give the install a try.</div>

							<div class="post">Well, I feel better now that I have aired that. I actually have trolled around the Gentoo forums some this afternoon. I think one of the answers to some of my problems is to not use the Athlon-XP ISOs. Though, you would think that having an Athlon-XP chip would prefer that. Some have suggested getting the i386 ISOs and doing a stage 1 install. That would be very generic and should run on anything x86. <br /><br />I went to look for i386 ISOs and do not find them. But I do find an x86 set. I wonder if that or the i686 might be better. Any suggestions? I am willing to try stage 1 (one time) if that is more likely to work.<br /><br />For my purpose Gentoo seems like the answer if I can get it going. I have already been on this project for 3 weeks trying to get the software installed. Whatsa couple more days of banging the well calloused head against the keyboard?</div>

							<div class="post">Ok, I am in the process of trying again.<br /><br />The problem came from trying to use an Athlon-XP LiveCD when I was just running an Athlon. This was confusing to me because when I did searches on the Gentoo forum to find what I needed, they pointed to the Athlon LiveCD. Apparently they no longer make this LiveCD (though there are several references to it). Since I could not find an Athlon LiveCD, I decided that the Athlon-XP must be the closest to it.<br /><br />It makes sense to me that if you are running an Athlon AMD chip, you would use the Athlon(whatever) Live CD as opposed to the Intel CD. I know that the Athlon and Anthlon-XP are different chips. But I thought they would be closer in architecture than AMD and Intel.<br /><br />What clued me into this was when I tried to run nano I would get &quot;Illegal Instruction.&quot; That indicates something like &quot;you are running a compiled program from the wrong platform. Apparently you would get this same error if you tried to run nano that was compiled for a sparc system on an Intel chip.<br /><br />So I finally got my kernel compiled at 4:00 this morning. Then it was the next big one X. It compiled fine and I am up with that. Currently I am 4 1/2 hours into compiling KDE (there were 104 programs to compile). We shall see how it goes.<br /><br />I still stick to my ** from above.</div>

							<div class="post">I am compiling kde at the moment with help <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/desktop.xml" target="_blank">from this Gentoo page.</a> I am also digging around in the Gentoo forum. <br /><br />When I do &quot;emerge kde&quot; it starts churning away happily. You can imagine my surprise when it said that there were 104 peices to install. (I had already done &quot;emerge -p kde&quot; to find this out, but since all of the information that tells you how many programs are going to be installed is at the top, I don't know how to go back and look at that.)<br /><br />So here I am 10 hours into this and only on number 67 of 104. Just 30 minutes ago it was working on 36, therefore it is moving along quite rapidly now.<br /><br />My question is, does this sound reasonable? I realize that this is a fresh install and therefore there are hardly any dependencies installed on my system. I am following the <a href="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=126152&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;highlight=stop+emerge&amp;start=0" target="_blank">KDE 3.2rc1 thread at the Gentoo forum</a>. People are talking about having the new installed in 2-6 hours. Someone with essentially the same hardware that I have has done it in 4 hours. <br /><br />In my /etc/make.conf file I have:<br />USE=&quot;qt kde alsa opengl lircd&quot; (and a couple of others that I don't remember right off).<br />The instructions say to have this line:<br />USE=&quot;qt kde -gnome -gtk&quot;<br /><br />Does having the -gnome and -gtk mean something different than not having them at all? While compiling I saw some gnome and gtk stuff flash by (at 152 thousand MPH).<br /><br />Athlon 1400 (not XP)<br />768 MB RAM<br />Cable Internet</div>

							<div class="post">Well, following suit with David and currently building my own install of Gentoo. My flight commander is putting it on his laptop and I had a 2 Ghz P4 sitting next to my WinXP workstation turned off most of time that is getting emerged with a fresh stage 2 install right now (so it was our old movie server which has been migrated to a Dell Poweredge 2650 with dual stupid fast Xeons and 4 gig of memory). <br /><br />I put Slackware 9.1 on my laptop, but I realized it just wasn't making me happy. Gentoo has really got me excited about linux again. I like knowing exactly what's going into my system and there is something about seeing a bunch of packages compiling. It just gives me a nice warm and fuzzy. I also love the tools that Portage gives you. I feel like I really have control over my system rather than the distribution and package managers deciding what I need and don't need.<br /><br />So far, the only thing I've run into is with compiling XFree86, and that was fixed after emerging automake and pam with the --nodeps flag. Easy and simple enough. Look at what it was missing and install the missing package. <br /><br />One huge thing I have to say about Gentoo is the community surrounding it. The Gentoo forums are filled with people asking great questions and tons of knowledgable answers to follow. I just can't say enough about the community. Also, the docs are great. Between the Tips and Tricks in the forums and the Docs section of the main Gentoo page, you can find out just about anything you would want to know. I think only FreeBSD accomplishes giving this much information and I think Gentoo actually surpasses it.<br /><br />So, I will pick up where rburt3 left off last year... Have you heard of Gentoo?</div>

I think only FreeBSD accomplishes giving this much information and I think Gentoo actually surpasses it.</div><br />I have been major impressed with the forums. If people would learn to use the search tool it would be a little nicer. But you really don't have alot of flaming about that going on. I have been on their forums about 23 1/2 hours each day for the last week. I have found almost all the answers that I needed in there (rburt3's number is in my speed dial for the rest of them). I just registered on thier forum yesterday so that I could reply to someone (then never did).<br /><br />But (since I started the pessimistic thread, I have to keep up the tone), there is a reason they have such detailed docs and forum activity. It ain't easy. It reminds me of the 17 floppy install of Slackware. I actually made the floppys, but got so scared I erased them so I would not ever be tempted to try it. That was back in the day when I didn't know you could own two computers (and could not afford it). I was afraid of trashing my main system. But I digress.<br /><br />Gentoo is not for everyone. I will be the first to say that. It is a challenge. Though I do feel like I am really running Linux again. Mandrake has kept me blissfully thinking that Linux was actually getting easier to run. <br /><br />I am glad my wife is getting the Gentoo box and I am keeping Mandrake on my desktop. <img src="Smileys/default/cheesy.gif" alt="cheesy" border="0" /></div>
