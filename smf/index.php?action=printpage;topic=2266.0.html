					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">My Laptop's (Dell Inspiron 8500) motherboard recently fried. &nbsp;The repair cost was less than buying a new desktop. &nbsp;However the desktop doesn't come with a monitor. &nbsp;Is there a way to completely remove the LCD screen off of the Laptop and use it as the primary display on the desktop??</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">short answer, NO.<br /><br />Long answer. &nbsp;Yes, but it requires laptop specific adapters that are often more expensive than a pc monitor.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Welcome to the group. If money is an issue in this (isn't it always?) then here is my suggestion. I would just get something that will get you by for a few months. Stick back $25 a month and start dreaming about that new monitor you are going to have 10 months from now. Then, by the time you get to that point, you may want to hold out a few more months to get that killer one for $400 that will last you for years and will be a joy to look at.<br /><br />Cheap monitors can be had for $20 or less if you look in enough holes (not new of course). I really recommend you wait and buy a good one than to rush out and get a $100 doozie. It is likely to last several years and you don't want that. You need a $20 one that will motivate you to save lots of money and get a good one. <br /><br />I have had an LCD monitor for 4 years. Even though it is only a 15&quot;, the quality is outstanding. I would rather work on it than the 17&quot; CRT that I am forced to use now.<br /><br />All that was free I guess. You did not ask for monitor buying tecniques. I say the same as Brent. Yes possible, not really feasable.</div>
