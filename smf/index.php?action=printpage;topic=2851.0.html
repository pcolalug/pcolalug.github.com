					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I am looking for an IT job. Anyone who has some contact please drop me a hint. I am currently unemployed, working on finishing the final module of my CCNA course to work towards actual cert. I like working with computers and technology. Some experience with UNIX, Linux and Windows. ;D</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Find a job on a helpdesk somewhere. If you want to get into the world of system administration without a degree, you have to start at the bottom. Unfortunately, NW Florida isn&#039;t a tech Mecca, so you&#039;ll have to pretty much take what you can get. Get a job anywhere doing anything with computers and start making contacts from there. Experiment with different technologies and learn as much as you can. Get into some college classes and start working toward a degree. <br /><br />A certification will get you an interview, but it will not get you a job. Don&#039;t think that having a CCNA will open a door for you to walk through into a job in networking. The CCNA is for entry level network technicians working on Cisco devices. It is a scratch on the surface. If I were to have someone come in wanting a job who had a CCNA with no real experience with network administration, I would turn them away. Certifications are to meant to backup experience, not get you experience to do a job. <br /><br />Also, if you do get an interview, don&#039;t lie about how much you know because most good managers will be able to see through it and if they don&#039;t, your true skill level will show through very quickly. Some experience will not cut it and you will wind up with some very bad references. Get a low level job working on a helpdesk or doing small computer repair, go to school (college) and build up a few years of experience. And explore, discover and break stuff so you can learn how to fix it. Experience is the most important part of working in the IT field. Good luck and be careful not to get yourself in over your head. Sorry to sound discouraging, but you are going to have to start small with &quot;some experience&quot; rather than &quot;subject matter expert.&quot;<br /><br />One thing to note. I notice you mentioned you are former military. If you got any kind of service connected disability rating through the VA, look for the local Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Office. If not, then if you have a current clearance, look at clearancejobs.com (http://www.clearancejobs.com). Also, look up some headhunters and post your resume on Monster...they&#039;ll find you. Best of luck.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;ve also been job hunting for a few months in the Pensacola area. I am looking for a programming job and not an IT job, but from my experience the best job web site for this area seems to be careerbuilder.com. Pensacolajobs.com, dice.com, and monster.com do an ok job. Computerjobs.com is almost useless for this area. Of course, you may be competing with a hundred other candidates, but checking them once or twice a week isn&#039;t too hard and sometimes gives some leads. Good luck.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You have to know someone on the inside! I have applied for all kinds of jobs that I know I was way more than qualified for and never recieve even a sorry. I&#039;ve been unemployed for just over a year now. I&#039;m going to have to work at Home Depot or something like that just to get by now.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think any job is a good job. Get whatever you can while looking for your job. Krispy Kreme hires. Can&#039;t beat that even if it is just sweeping the floors. Too many people will pass up minimum wage hoping to get something better when the minimum wage will at least pay some bills.<br /><br />I am set for a job and will probably never have to look again in my life, so it is easy for me to say this. But, get out there, take anything while trying to make the right job happen.</div>
