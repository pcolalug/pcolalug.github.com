					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hiya,<br /><br />I am asking this here as I have no idea what is going on in the software discussions.<br /><br />I now have Linux running (yea!) and I have not the slightest idea what software I really need. I am a CS student so I will be doing some java programming, basic shell scripting and so forth.<br /><br />Are there any editors/programs that y'all would reccomend out of the seemingly thousand or so that came with Mandrake for the KDE? I have looked at some software websites but again, it is more for the hard-core programmers and gamers....I am just easing into the world of open operating systems.....thanks in advance!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Use whatever editor you use at school and already know. &nbsp;Probably jgrasp or eclipse or netbeans? &nbsp;They are all good for java. &nbsp;KDE folks seem to like KDevelop for C/C++ programming. &nbsp;I used to use vi for everything, but I'm using emacs now. &nbsp;Those two aren't very user friendly, but if you're going to spend a lot of time editing code, especially over telnet, it's worth learning one of them.<br /><br />I use slackware, and the latest jave JDK came installed and ready to use, I'm not sure if it's setup for you in mandrake, but if not it's easy to do, just let us know.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Kate is included in KDE and does code highlighting for a large variety of languages, but Eclipse is one of the better ones for flexibility. KDevelop is more of a full featured IDE. Eclipse is as well, but it supports more(?) plugins and is also written in Java, and has tie-ins for GTK and Win32. I use it and vim mostly, but like imnes said, use whatever you use at school if you can.</div>
