					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, HL2 should be released fairly soon. &nbsp;Granted I'm going to be playing Doom 3, Dawn of War, and Halo 2 (ah, Halo 2 how I await thee) mostly but I'm excited about Half-Life 2 as well. &nbsp;Unfortunately I haven't found any news about Valve releasing a client for it and Cedega, in all its not-so-free glory, doesn't support it yet (and there's no guarantee it will be supported). &nbsp;So, assuming someone on this forum finds Half-Life 2 mildly appealing, what are YOU going to do?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I voted &quot;Install Windows&quot; but I already run Windows on my desktop. I rather not go through the hassles of desktop linux and this is a prime example of one of those hassles.<br /><br />By the way, Dawn of War is freakin sweet. I've been playing the crap out of it and has inspired me to get back into Warhammer 40k (the tabletop game). My paints and minis are sitting where my laptop once did.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">LOL, I figured Dawn of War would be my way to &quot;affordably&quot; play Warhammer 40K. &nbsp;I had to sell my minis but now I play MechWarrior: Dark Age. &nbsp;If you ever want some variety in tabletop, give it a go, lots of fun, very different &quot;freeform&quot; feel.<br /><br />I heard there's no level editor which is a serious minus for replayability, but I have yet to read one negative review which is a MAJOR plus. &nbsp;I'm normally not much into RTS games and more into tactical games since RTSes typically have a &quot;sim city&quot; feel to them I don't like...I just want to pummel my opponent with an army, namsayin? &nbsp;From my understanding that's the focus of Dawn of War and that's what I like to hear. &nbsp; :twisted: <br /><br /><br />Oh, are you playing Dawn of War in Windows or Linux? &nbsp;I'm hoping to use my new gaming box as a Linux-only machine for, um, &quot;legal&quot; reasons, heh heh. &nbsp;That and Doom 3 runs better in Linux, humorously.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I would say DoW is definitely one of those games where you can take several approaches with. You can try the rush tactic or the (not so) slow build up of a huge massive army. The game limits you in how many units you can build, but getting to that limit seems to be extreme overkill. Like I said before, my desktop runs Windows and I don't have the time, considering all my projects and work, to install Linux on this system.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">To answer the poll question: &nbsp;NONE OF THE ABOVE.<br /><br />I won't install Windows, I won't use Wine, and I won't pay for something to allow me to play a game. &nbsp;What I will do, is wait for a Linux binary, and if it doesn't happen, I won't play the game.<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This DOES bring up another question I had that's related to the whole idea. &nbsp;I only attach it to HL2 because like Halo 2 and Doom 3 it's one of the most highly anticipated games of our age (seriously, these are the ones to sell BIG...like, REALLY BIG) and HL2 carries a very dedicated following.<br /><br />Anyway, suppose I've got, I dunno, Dawn of War. &nbsp;To my knowledge there's no linux binary nor is there one planned. &nbsp;I've got Wine which isn't the greatest implementation of DX9 but to my knowledge does it fairly well. &nbsp;So suppose I want to play DoW on my Linux box. &nbsp;How do I go about that? &nbsp;Using wine can I run the Windows installer and run it that way, or do I still need a Linux installation program? &nbsp;Would it even be worth it?<br /><br /><br /><br />Essentially I really don't feel like, um, &quot;buying&quot; another copy of Windows XP for this box and, honestly, I really like how Linux is run. &nbsp;I figure it's not asking for much out of an OS and surely there's a way to do it, I'm just curious as to how we'd beat it out of it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Oh, do you think maybe if I e-mailed Valve or Transgaming about DoW and HL2 (not Valve about HL2, you get the idea) if they'd tell me about their Linux plans for these games? &nbsp;I'm just not used to teh idea of e-mailing anyone other than my friends and getting a response.</div>
