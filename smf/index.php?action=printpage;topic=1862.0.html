					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi all,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I find that I need to gen up a web page and was wondering if there is a Linux equivalent to Dreamweaver or even (ugh!) Frontpage? &nbsp;I've just been Googling for this and can't seem to find anything.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What <i>do</i> you use for web page development under Linux? &nbsp;Thanks!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bill</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">nvu is showing (http://nvu.com/) promise. It has not been too intuitive for me since coding with a text editor is what I am used to. That is not to say it is a bad program, it just didnt fit me. When I was looking for a program like that it really looked good.<br /><br />Though it is developed by Linspire, it can be used on any Linux distro and Windows.<br /><br />Depending on how complicated your page is and how picky you are with your code, you might find that the HTML editor/layout in OpenOffice.org will fit your needs<br /><br />Welcome to the group.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks David!<br /><br />That looks exactly like what I was looking for!<br /><br />Now all I have to do is get it to work with SuSE 64bit . . . and I'm not having a lot of luck with that. &nbsp;I could go back to 32bit and everything would work fine I'm sure, but I'm playing.<br /><br />I'm not picky at all with my code . . . I'll do anything I have to to get it to work. &nbsp;I've even been so desperate that I've used windows . . . <br /><br />But after years of windows sin and degradation, now I'm trying to reform and follow the 12 steps to windows abstinence. &nbsp;By which I mean I'm trying to transfer everything I do to Linux from Windows 2K. &nbsp;I won't be able to do it all for quite some time, I know, but I suspect that it's a “pay now, or pay more later” situation. &nbsp;I tried Gentoo 64 bit first, but I got my hand bit at every turn. &nbsp;SuSE at least runs for a newbie like me. &nbsp;This is incredibly complex stuff.<br /><br />The web page I am contemplating is also fairly complex, and will involve MySQL and PHP fairly extensively . . . which is why I wanted all the help I can get with the software!<br /><br />Thanks again for your help. &nbsp;I didn't know there was a “Intro” area . . . I'll go there now.<br /><br />Bill</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">If you're a KDE man (and with SuSE, you generally are wether you like it or not... ;)), give the latest Quanta a try. They have support for PHP, MySQL, and a whole host of other languages. The help for each language/tech is built into the environment. The last few additions had a visual layout tool (similar in spirit to Dreamweaver's WYSIWYG mode) that wasn't really functional. The latest release notes report that this is now a functional part of the IDE, but I haven't had the opportunity to try it out yet.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I use vim for all of my php. Gentoo's ebuild includes a nice config that does an excellent job of syntax highlighting for a large number of languages and styles of configuration files. It is worth noting, I'm command line only where linux is concerned.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks rburt3 and Rugmonster,<br /><br />Your replies are &quot;just in time&quot; as I couldn't figure out how to install Nvu in SuSE. &nbsp;It seems that if it isn't listed in YAST you can forget about it. &nbsp;Of course, this probably prevented me from hosing the entire system, so I guess I shouldn't complain (amd64 system). Rburt3, your comment about being &quot;a KDE man&quot; with SuSE is so true . . it took me forever to figure out how to get OUT of KDE and to the command line. &nbsp;I hate to RTFM . . .<br /><br />Anyway, Quanta was in YAST and I have it installed! &nbsp;I think that VIM is as well, but I'm going to give this one a try first because I need all the help I can get! &nbsp;I have played with VIM before (in windows) and it is certainly a good editor. &nbsp;My problem is a serious case of laziness and too much to do.<br /><br />A year or two ago I found a &quot;package&quot; that had Apache, PHP and MySQL in it set up to run on windows. &nbsp;I played with that a little then got sidetracked, but I can see that they are all excellent. &nbsp;So, now I'm going to see if I can get something serious together with them. &nbsp;It may be that doing this and trying to learn Linux all at once is a setup for failure, but it won't be the first time. &nbsp;The skin just gets thicker.<br /><br />Thanks again for your help! &nbsp;I'll see ya in a couple of weeks. &nbsp;Well, maybe not you, Rugmonster, unless you come back for another visit!<br /><br />Bill</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well if you're not against emulation, I've had no problems running Dreamweaver in Crossover Office. &nbsp;(I'm assuming you have a copy of dreamweaver). &nbsp; Crossover Office is a Windows Emulator for Linux. &nbsp;It does not require a copy of windows to work, it runs on it's own within linux.<br /><br />http://www.codeweavers.com/site/products/cxoffice/?cw=89ae153df0759310fff25b21a9603626<br /><br />The only version of crossover office I've tried is 2.1.0 I think (not sure what version they're up to). &nbsp;Also I was using Dreamweaver MX (I couldn't get MX 2004 to run). <br /><br />If you don't need all the fancy HTML drag-and-drop editing in Dreamweaver, then I also recommend trying Zend IDE. &nbsp;(Although it's not free, it's built in Java and runs everywhere. &nbsp;It's a pretty nice tool).<br /><br />http://www.zend.com/store/products/zend-studio.php<br /><br />It's kinda pricey though so unless you're gonna be doing a lot of PHP coding you probably don't need it.<br /><br />My current system (Slackware + Dropline Gnome) has installed some html editor called Screem, but I haven't played with it yet so I dunno how it compares.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi imnes,<br /><br />Thanks for the info! &nbsp;I just went to the Zend page and took a look . . . and it sure looks great! &nbsp;As you say, pricey, but not too bad at all if it works. &nbsp;I'm going to download it and give it a try.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it looks like I will have to use it under windows, as SuSE hasn't got a script in YAST to run it with . . . or anyway I haven't figured out how to take a &quot;foreign&quot; binary (no doubt 32 bit) and get it to run under 64 bit SuSE. &nbsp;I'm a little reluctant to spend too much time playing with this problem as well, as I only installed SuSE as a temporary expedient until Gentoo or OpenBSD catches up with the 64 bit stuff. &nbsp; Or . . . am I missing something here?<br /><br />I suspect that the price of the program would cover both windows and linux versions (or they might use the same registrtion numbers) so I may be able to buy the windows version and start using it, then change over later. &nbsp;I'll call them and ask.<br /><br />Thanks again!</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Zend is just a java program, so assuming you have a working java runtime (check in yast, it should have one) then it will run fine.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi imnes,<br /><br />Yup, Java runtime is there.<br /><br />But I really feel stupid. &nbsp;I also have VIM on the system, but I can't seem to run it! &nbsp;It doesn't come up in the &quot;All Applications&quot; (start menu?), and when I use the &quot;find&quot; program it shows up as an executable in the /usr/bin directory . . . but how do I run the darn thing? &nbsp;Just clicking doesn't seem to work, so I must be missing something basic here.<br /><br />I re-installed it with YAST, but no luck, it still doesn't show up as an application.<br /><br />So, if I download Zend . . . how would I start it? &nbsp;And (hopefully) link it to an icon on the desktop?<br /><br />Bill</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Let me know the name of the file you download for Zend. &nbsp;It's either going to be an archive (maybe tar.bz2 or .zip) which you'll need to uncompress first, or just an installer program which you can run. &nbsp;It will install to the system, add program shortcuts (you can then drag them to your Desktop for easy access). &nbsp;Then just click on the Zend IDE icon to start the program. &nbsp;<br /><br />If you have any troubles, let us know.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks imnes,<br /><br />Had to do a little actual work this morning (the bane of the computering classes) so I'm a little tardy in replying. &nbsp;Sorry!<br /><br />The Zend program has a 30 day trial, and I found another similar one called NuSphere PHPed which also sounds good with a 30 day trial. &nbsp;The NuSphere program can also manage the database from within the IDE, so that sounds good to me. &nbsp;Anyway, because of the time limitations I think that I had better get my database in order before installing either of them so I have something &nbsp;to work with. &nbsp;I've just downloaded MySQL and an old copy of MySQL Front so I'm going to install them and get to work. &nbsp;I'm looking at several days of data-entry tedium here *sigh*.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I fear that I either have to install a 32 bit version of some *unix (so it actually works with everything) or revert back to windows temporarily. &nbsp;I've set up my system to dual-boot on win 2K, and I've ordered the CDs for OpenBSD 3.6 (which is advertised as working with amd64, smp, etc . . .) so I think I'm going to stall a couple of months until the BSD disks show up. &nbsp;In the meanwhile I'll keep playing with SuSE . . . now that I know how to get OUT of KDE. &nbsp; <br /><br />I really like the idea behind OpenBSD (no extras, just security and stability), and if I can make it work for me at all that may be the way for me to go. &nbsp;I understand that the tradeoff is not being able to implement all the &quot;bells and whistles&quot; but I still think that I will be able to do enough with it to be very happy. &nbsp;Especially if I can eventually bottle up windows in vmware and lose the dual-boot. &nbsp;I really hate the way windows calls home all the time and who knows what else. &nbsp;As it is, I just don't give it network access. &nbsp;SuSE works fine for that. &nbsp;(I also think that SuSE is going to be fine for my wife . . . she will never figure out how to log in as root and truly screw things up . . .)<br /><br />Thanks again for all your help. &nbsp;I'll see you at the next meeting!<br /><br />Bill</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I was under the same impression. I guess I should install some 64 bit on my system and see if it will switch back. Supposedly, WinXP 64 will run 32 bit applications, just not 32 bit drivers. One of these days when things calm down and I have enough time to install gentoo on this box, I'll see.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi imnes and Rugmonster,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; This is a very complex issue and I'm certainly no expert. &nbsp;As I understand it, the short answer seems to be: &nbsp;amd64 machines will run either 32 bit or 64 bit code . . . if they are in that particular mode. &nbsp;The critical issue seems to be with things like pointers, default word lengths and the like. &nbsp;Obviously, if your pointer suddenly has 32 extra low-order bits it isn't going to be pointing anywhere near where you want it to.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So, if you are cruising along in 64 bit mode and you want to run a 32 bit binary you have to switch modes . . . which probably means pushing everything on a stack somewhere, switching modes, poping things back and continuing on. &nbsp;I'm just guessing here, of course, but there has to be some mechanism to make the transition. &nbsp;You also need to be using the appropriate libraries, so these need to be pointed to appropriately. &nbsp;Obviously this can be done, but some effort has to be made to do it. &nbsp;Which is to say, you can't just throw some arbitrary binary at it with out providing for it in advance.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which is one of the main reasons I wanted to go with Gentoo. &nbsp;It would seem that you could simply compile all your source code in 64 bit mode and away you go . . . and in many cases this is true. &nbsp;On the other hand, in many cases it is not true as well. &nbsp; I've been following the amd64 forum on Gentoo.org for months now and the general impression I get (and some folk have stated) is that if you need to get serious work done stick to 32 bit for a while longer. &nbsp;Even relatively simple programs like GRUB have to be used as a 32 bit binary, it won't compile in 64 bit mode. &nbsp;GRUB doesn't matter, of course, because you haven't actually begun anything when you use it, but the same is true of Open Office and several others. &nbsp;Vmware apparently remains too flakey to be useful, for another example.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some people are reporting smooth working systems under 64 bit (Gentoo), but they are invariably far more experienced than me! &nbsp;And I have to admit that the solutions and &quot;workarounds&quot; that some of the folks on the Gentoo forum have come up with are nothing less than astounding! &nbsp;I can't understand most of them even after they are presented to me in words of less than 4 letters!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All of which is NOT a reason to forgoe a 64 bit system of some sort. &nbsp;I have no doubt at all that all of this will get sorted out eventually . . . it is just a very nasty and horribly complicated problem. &nbsp;AND the 64 bit processors are really, really fast in both 64 bit and 32 bit modes! &nbsp;I did do a complete stage 1 Gentoo install before deciding to give it up for a while, and my dual 2GHz Opteron system can compile the entire kernel in less than 90 seconds, for example. &nbsp;The entire stage 1 install took about 3 hours, and a good deal of that was spent downloading source code and portage scripts from Cox cable.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Gentoo amd64 forum is very helpful, and I would strongly recommend you go snoop around there to see what is happening. &nbsp;People are extremely good about answering questions (as here!) and the 32 v 64 bit question comes up fairly often.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You could, of course, and that would work.<br /><br />On the other hand, I think that Enemy Territory works on amd64 . . . but I'm not sure. &nbsp;A lot of things certainly do work, its just that the whole thing seems a little flakey to me. &nbsp;Check out: &nbsp;http://forums.gentoo.org/viewforum.php?f=46&amp;sid=1843b65773fe57afcab288ae17710f94<br />There is a &quot;sticky&quot; at the top with a list of programs that work.</div>
