					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi all, this is &quot;Dan C&quot;, posting under a newly registered name.&nbsp; I had to do that (through an anonymous web proxy), because our illustrious &quot;president&quot; (green_dragon37) has BANNED me from using the forums.&nbsp; Isn&#039;t that nice?&nbsp; Because I ask simple, relevant questions as to why he is not doing his job as the LUG president, such as not making an announcement of any kind about this month&#039;s meeting until the wee hours of the night before, and only then because of my previous post in this thread, he bans me from the forums.<br /><br />He &quot;didn&#039;t have time&quot; to prepare for this month&#039;s meeting.&nbsp; I guess it just snuck up on him, eh?&nbsp; Why didn&#039;t you have time???&nbsp; Were you busy out looking for a job, Mr. President???&nbsp; Bleh.<br /><br />It&#039;s sad what has become of these forums and this LUG.&nbsp; Some of you keep talking about wanting to change and improve things, but nothing ever gets done.&nbsp; I think the current LUG officers should be ashamed of themselves.&nbsp; Last I knew, the LUG held officer elections in September.&nbsp; I wonder if that&#039;s going to happen this year...<br /><br />You can now delete this post, and ban this username.&nbsp; Maybe somebody will get to read it before you do that.&nbsp; You are a disgrace.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">No Dan, I didn&#039;t ban you because of your comments on the forums, I banned you (for a short 7 days in fact) because of the hateful things you said to me on AIM, and because you, in turn, banned me from our LUG&#039;s IRC channel.&nbsp; For no reason.&nbsp; You just need to cool off and chill WAAAY out, apparently, so I was merely giving you time to do so.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Wow this is getting a little bad so I figured I better step in and say something, First of all I would like to ask everybody to turn out next month for elections!<br />Although I figure everyone watching this abuse of the president as in last year no one will step up. At the lastelections there wasno one there to fill the postions then everyone wonders why nohing isgetting done and Dan knows this as well as anyone. This lug has been going for around 7 years and has had many indivuals gleem something from it either by meetings or the forums and I wih to see that continue. I have dedicated myself to putting out one little how-to in the forums per week and also to putting togehter a little tutotial presentation each month, That does not mean that will be all we need, we need people to step up and put together something of there own to present. a new application or piece of code anything that they have interest in.<br />This end fighting has to stopin order for the Lug to move on! Also I apologize to the Duck for Dan&#039;s rude behavior on that part, But at the same time I would ask that we all hold off on the acusations and name calling for the time being.................a truce as it would be for the better of the LUG.<br /><br />When I first founded this I had no idea that one day I would have grown adults fighting over the how&#039;s and why&#039;s of how it is run!<br />This is suppose to be fun and for the enjoyment of all those that have an interest in Linux.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yeah, I&#039;d like to take this time to remind everyone that this LUG actually has by-laws... This kind of non-constructive bickering is just leading to (and probably already has) a violation of our 4th rule.<br /><br />Locking for the sake of the group</div>
