					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I have downloaded the latest RC of Gentoo 1.4 and working on the install. &nbsp;Compiling gnome right now. &nbsp;Hopefully things work well this time around, I wanted to give it another shot since I haven't played with it in so long. &nbsp;BTW: Anybody else have the 'joy' of browsing this bulletin board system through lynx? &nbsp;A little difficult to navigate ;) &nbsp;I'll keep you posted on how it works (or doesn't) for me. &nbsp;<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I gotta say, so far Gentoo has me impressed. &nbsp;Last time I tried it I went with a stage 3 install, so I missed out on a lot of the optimized compiling. &nbsp;This time though I let it go through everything from stage 1. &nbsp;I've noticed a huge speed increase, especially evident in Gnome 2. &nbsp;Very responsive, even the menus (which I used to notice a delay in as the icons were loaded) popup instantly now (this is while I have two other compilers going). &nbsp;I like it, only problem now is I need to recompile my kernel again and get my sound card working. &nbsp;Otherwise though, things are going great.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The initial install was quick. &nbsp;Building the base system takes a while, I just let it run while I was at school and it was done by the time I got back a few hours later. <br /><br />Then you have to compile a custom kernel and other misc tasks, that took me all of about 20 minutes. &nbsp;<br /><br />The hard part is waiting for X and your window managers and other apps to compile. &nbsp;I let X and Gnome2 compile overnight so they took less than 8 hours. &nbsp;Now I'm building the apps I need as I go, got galeon, blackdown java, gimp, open office is gonna take a while. &nbsp;I tried to compile gaim but it refused, stopped on some file, an Icon I think but I haven't looked into fixing it. &nbsp;I installed CenterICQ which is a really nice console based instant messaging program I used in BSD when I wasn't in X, it supports AIM, ICQ, and some of the other chat clients all in one and integrates them with each other, very nice if you want to check it out.<br /><br />As it sits right now I have a functional system with very few apps, but it's d**n fast. &nbsp;So far I've spent about 3 days on it. &nbsp;I would guess it would take me a week of playing with it part time to get it to the same state as my typical RedHat / MDK install.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Yeah, as crowe said, I gave it a shot recently and it didn't go so well, once the system was up and running. I had to make some, ehem, <i>modifications</i> to the net.eth0 script to get it working, but that was no biggie. My main problem was getting things like KDE to emerge. Once it hit postgres or mysql, it would bomb looking for raid.o. I couldn't find it eather, and had bills to pay, so I let it go and installed RedHat 8.0.<br /><br />I guess I need a crash course in kernel configuring under Linux (it's sooo much easier in BSD!). If anyone would like to volenteer to come over and hold my hand through a kernel config/compile, there's beer and pizza in it for ya! ;)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Me too. &nbsp;Things were going well, Gnome2 built fine. &nbsp;Then GAIM wouldn't build, and other apps started giving me problems. &nbsp;(I think an old gnome app installed gnome1 files that sort-of broke gnome2.) &nbsp;Anyway, it was easier to format and reload RH8, so maybe another try later...<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I can speak from experience. &nbsp;For me, even without the fancy GUI front-ends that a lot of linux disto's have, BSD is a much nicer system to maintain and work with. &nbsp;Kernel compiles are straightforward (I can actually tell what > %50 of the options in the kernel actually mean ;) ) &nbsp;Ports system is very nice.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I haven't spent near enough time playing with any of the flavors of BSD to really get a good feel for them. I keep hearing the Slackware is very similar to *BSD and that is what I learned on and used to administer. I am currently responsible for a couple modified BSDi systems (Sidewinder firewalls actually), but they are very specialized and I can't do too much tinkering with them, so I can't get in and get my hands dirty like I would like.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote from: imnes</div><div class="quote">Kernel compiles are straightforward (I can actually tell what > %50 of the options in the kernel actually mean)</div><br /><br />It didn't take too long to figure out what the majority of options in the linux kernel were for. I was thrown off recently when I tried a -ac patch for the first time, but otherwise, it at all seems pretty straight forward to me. I have found that just googling for that option will bring up some sort of documentation about it. I guess after compiling and recompiling you begin to figure out what you need for your system.<br /><br />And for system maintenance, I always go back to Debian for ease. Those of us who use Debian will always bring up apt-get, but ports seems to have a very similar functionality if the original is anything like what I've seen in Gentoo's portage. <br /><br />-------<br />Ruggy</div>

True, you might not always be able to put the kernel on a floppy to boot the system, but a floppy kernel doesn't need to be preemptible or have sound drivers or smbfs kernel support. For some reason, I just don't like modules. I like to have everything compiled in. I leave module support in, just in case I need to swap a nic and need to insmod something later (happened once), but I usually compile something in unless I don't know what the bugger is and if I'm afraid I might need to pull it out to make the system stable again...but that is why you always keep your last good kernel available to boot in case that new kernel flops.<br /><br />I like Pizza Hut Supreme Deep Dish and Corona with a lime or Heineken, but Bud will do...thanks<br /><br />-------<br />Ruggy</div>
