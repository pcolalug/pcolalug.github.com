					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This post is somewhat tied to the last post in this forum, but I'll ask anyway.<br /><br />I'm looking to get a computer tech job at a shop here in Pensacola. &nbsp;I'd like to work for one that builds linux computers etc.<br /><br />I know nvt does...does anyone know of others?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I don't want to detract from your post, Brent, but a question came to mind while reading this. I keep hearing how companies are valuing linux skills more and more these days, but it remains that there just aren't that many places that use linux in a big way. It seems that outside of the major tech centers, there just isn't very much going on except Microsoft. It seems to me that Northwest Florida would be more Windows and some commercial Unix environments.<br /><br />With that said, if more companies started transitioning to linux for some of their operations, would they be able to find qualified admins to run those systems local to NWFL? What makes a qualified unix/linux admin? Forgive my wandering train of thought, but I just thought it might spur some conversation and hopefully reaffirm my hope that I will be able to work with linux/unix when I'm done with my current job.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Funny. &nbsp;DanC and I were discussing this topic on IRC a week or so ago.<br /><br />Lots of Linux in the NC region, quite a bit in NYC and of course, California. &nbsp;It is a chicken-egg thing for Linux services here. &nbsp;How do you bring in Linux if you don't have admins that have significant experience with the OS and its applications? &nbsp;How do the admins get that experience without running it in production?<br /><br />It is simply paramount that organizations like this market and push Linux advocacy. &nbsp;It can't be just the steering committee either.<br /><br />In the Raleigh-Durham area it just seemed to happen. &nbsp;Same in Virginia. &nbsp;ISP's were running Linux, then it just seemed to start pouring in through the back doors quietly and then boom managers finally started asking how stuff was getting done. &nbsp;When they found out they about pottied in their pants because it was unapproved or not on some list, etc. &nbsp;But when folks showed that hardware we were tossing out was back in service and being maintained better than say...Solaris 2.5.1 or 2.6...they started to take it serious.<br /><br />It just seems like this area of the country is behind technically in some areas with an over reliance on Microsoft. &nbsp;I want to believe a critical mass will happen in experience or backdoor systems everywhere. &nbsp;Hopefully it will happen here too.<br /><br />Scott</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Funny thing is, I was an admin of an ISP back in 1999 to 2001 in Jay, FL (of all places) than ran all slackware linux servers. Back then, I knew another ISP that ended up getting bought out that was in Pensacola that ran all linux stuff with maybe a sparcstation for fun, but it doesn't seem to go beyond ISPs. Now that the government is able to use linux openly, I think it is going to help the situation. I have been sneaking linux in where ever it made sense with much quiet success. The key is going to be getting the contractors that support the government operations to start adopting it, because nothing original comes out of the government directly. I think Nick is seeing the early stages of this at his job. <br /><br />As far as NW FL, I think there would be a great market for small, independent consultants to help small businesses setup small networks and base their services around a linux platform. I'm thinking of the businesses that don't want to hire a full time IT person. If someone could start getting some of the smaller businesses going with an open solution, provided they get outstanding support from their outsourced IT consultants, they talk with their peers and interest grows. <br /><br />I stood in line at the tag agency talking to a lady about how the network at her husband's business is always going down. She was ready to see a resume when I gave her some hope that it didn't have to be like that. I think the market is there for quality consulting, fresh ideas and dependable technologies. I think the potential for a linux break out in NWFL is there, but no demand yet. I guess that's our job, to create the demand.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I know that since I've taken over the network where I work, I've managed to get three Non-Micro$oft servers (2 OpenBSD and 1 Redhat Linux) so it <i>can</i> be done. It wasn't even a money issue since we have corporate licenses available for Win 2k3 server, I presented them as much more secure and maintenance free, which translated to me being more productive on other tasks, especially like this past week being out of town. (Which being able to reach out and touch them via ssh out of the box is a definite bonus!)<br /><br />Jesse</div>
