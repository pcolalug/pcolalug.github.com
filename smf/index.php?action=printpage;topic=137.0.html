					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">OK, I'm sold on the Zaurus. Barring any unforseen financial difficulties, I should be toting one of these around in a month or so.<br /><br />But I do have some questions. Forgive me if my ignorance shows through.<br /><br />Do you have to boot it up? I read something about rebooting every so often. Does that mean that when it is turned &quot;off&quot; it is really just in a sleep mode?<br /><br />How long do the batteries last between charges? How long does it take to charge?<br /><br />What I have read says it will trade addresses with the Palm through the IR port. Have you tried this?<br /><br />When can I see it? I would like to talk to you (or your wife, the resident expert) in person sometime. I will be back in town early next week. Drop me a personal message in the forum here and we can work out details.<br /><br />David</div>

My wife is getting tired of hearing all the things the Zaurus can do.<br /><br />I especially like the thought of imputting text via a morse code key. Ed, did &nbsp;you catch that? Only the Ham Radio operators in the group would care, but it is neat.<br /><br />Steve, I know you are going to trick yours out more than rburt's wife will. You will have to tell us all the things that you do with it. That way I will have some projects to work on as soon as I get mine.<br /><br />Fess up. Who else has already bought one of these, or will in the next month as a result of this thread?<br /><br />See, these forums can help bolster the economy.<br /><br />David Peach<br />Licensed Amature Radio Operator, KU4LL</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Actually I was talking about the screen protectors that lay on the screen to keep you from scratching it with the stylus. If you ever have problems with the unit and send it to Sharp and it has scratches on the screen from the stylus, they charge you something like $200 for a new screen. There are companies that sell milar protectors that stick to the screen. You know, they're the plastic that everyone peels off the screen on their VCRs, DVD players, etc.<br /><br />Anyway, if it doesn't come with a protector on the screen, then I guess I'll need to get some from the Internet.<br /><br />Steve</div>

Seems shady to me.&quot;<br /><br />Well, if it says anywhere in the user's manual or on the web site that they recommend screen protectors be used or if they say you used your stylus improperly thereby causing scratches then I'd assume they can charge you.<br /><br />Either way, I still don't want my screen getting scratched/pitted from tapping on it. I'll look into some decent protectors for it. <br /><br />Here (http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006F2TZ/qid=1030470574/sr=2-2/ref=sr_2_2/104-2750044-4653507) is what I'm looking for.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Prices are changing again for the Zaurus at buy.com. I ordered mine tonight for $347.<br /><br />Oooo, I can't wait for &quot;Brown&quot; to show up at my door.<br /><br />Sure will miss the motorcycle that I had to sell to get it though. I guess a week or two with the new toy will wash away the memories.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Wow! I have had it two weeks and I am going back through the thread. <br /><br />It is hard to beleive that I used to own a motorcycle. I would have forgotten all about it if I had not gone through the old news.<br /><br />Now we just need a few more people to get one and we can start a whole new section of our forums. I know ZaurusZone (http://www.zauruszone.com) has their forums, but I feel more comfortable asking you guys a few questions than sticking my neck out for total strangers.<br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">After reading that article make sure that you follow the link to the &quot;Related Stories.&quot; They have a whole slew of devices that are currently running Linux.<br /><br />Don't miss the story (http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT8619741565.html) about the Kaii device. It is compatible with the Zaurus. Just different hardware. That is exciting to know that other hardware makers are jumping on board. That can be nothing but good for the future of the Z.<br /><br />A few more posts in this thread and we will have to open up a new Zaurus section on the board. <br /><br />David</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, Buy.com is up to $399 (http://www.buy.com/retail/product.asp?sku=10321161&hdwt=30301&loc=101) again. They have been completely out of stock for a couple of weeks. They actually got one shipment in, but were sold out in less than 18 hours (according to a post at zauruszone.com (http://www.zauruszone.farplanet.net/invboard/index.php)).<br /><br />Currently they are not in stock but they are expecting to be able to ship in 3-5 days.<br /><br />David</div>
