					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Howdy.&nbsp; I am the speaker coordinator for the Southeast Linuxfest, and I&#039;m just making the rounds to give the community at large a final heads up on the Southeast Linuxfest, and recruit volunteers.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />What is the Southeast Linuxfest?<br />&nbsp;<br />The SouthEast LinuxFest is a community event for anyone who wants to learn more about Linux and Free &amp; Open Source software. It is part educational conference, and part social gathering. Like Linux itself, it is shared with attendees of all skill levels to communicate tips, ideas, and to benefit all who use Linux/Free and Open Source Software. LinuxFest is the place to learn, to make new friends, to network with new business partners, and most importantly, to have fun!<br />&nbsp;<br />So no longer do you need to drive to Ohio for OLF or Los Angeles for SCaLE.&nbsp; &nbsp;We&#039;re bringing back the spirit of the old Atlanta Linux Showcase, and making sure that there will once again be a major Linux event in the GNU/South indefinitely.<br />&nbsp;<br />Our first annual event will be June 13th, at Hendrix Student Center on the campus of Clemson University, Clemson, SC.&nbsp; &nbsp;Doors open to the public at 8:30 AM, and &quot;officially&quot; close at 6:00 PM.&nbsp; &nbsp;There will be a pre-party at 8:00 PM June 12th, and a post-party after the event June 13th. <br />&nbsp;<br />Our speaker lineup includes:<br />Keith Bergelt; Open Invention Network<br />Joe &quot;Zonker&quot; Brockmeier; OpenSuse<br />Russell Bryant; Digium<br />Greg DeKoenigsberg; Red Hat<br />Chris DiBona; Google<br />Paul Frields; Fedora<br />Ian Geiser; The KDE Project<br />Ryan &quot;Icculus&quot; Gordon; The Linux Games Industry<br />Pete Graner; Canonical/Ubuntu<br />Michelle and Michael Hall; QuinnCo / Qimo<br />Alan Hicks; Slackware<br />D. Richard Hipp; SQLite, CVSTrac, Fossil<br />Brian Leonard; Sun Microsystems<br />Semmy Purewal; College of Charleston<br />Clint Savage; Fedora<br />Wendy Seltzer; EFF<br />Mark Spencer; Digium<br />Richard Weait; OpenStreetMap<br />&nbsp;Chad Wollenberg; Linux Basement<br />Robby Workman; Slackware<br /><br />We will need volunteers to do everything from registration to shuttle service to and from major airports for our speakers.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you are interested in helping out, please reply back.<br />&nbsp;<br />SELF is *free* to attend, though an optional support package with t-shirt and drink tickets is available.<br />&nbsp;<br />Sign up to attend today at http://www.southeastlinuxfest.org<br />&nbsp;<br />-----------------------<br />Jeremy Sands<br />Speaker Coordinator<br />Southeast Linuxfest<br />Linux in the GNU/South</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I wouldn&#039;t mind attending this, to see/hear some of the speakers listed, but......... it&#039;s 450 miles from Pensacola to Clemson....&nbsp; Not quite as far as Ohio, but too far for me.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br /><br />Perhaps it will be closer in future years.&nbsp; Sounds like an interesting event, in any case.<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sounds like a great meeting. I agree that it is a bit of a drive and somewhat short notice. Maybe location and notification will be better next year. If anyone goes please be willing to bring a report back and convince us why we need to put it on our calendars for next year. </div>
