					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I didn't think there was a Linux version yet... Also, its prolly gonna take a while to get it from TuxGames. Great site and no doubt, but shipping from the UK is eternal :roll:. Took me a week-and-a-half to get my UT2k3 back in the day.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">OK, well, I have the box in my hot hands... &nbsp;First of all, there's been a lot of hype about the hardware requirements for this game. &nbsp;Here's what the box itself says is the minimums required:<br /><br />Pentium4 1.5Ghz &nbsp;or &nbsp;AthlonXP 1500+<br />64Mb 3D accelerated video card<br />384Mb RAM<br />2.2Gb HD space<br />8x CDROM<br />DirectX9.0b compatible sound card<br />Microsoft Windows XP or 2000<br /><br />The box specifically says that 95/98/ME/NT is not supported, and there is no mention of Linux. &nbsp;I looked around on the CD's (there's 3 of them) and there's no sign of a Linux installer (hopefully there will be one out soon).<br /><br />I had an old Win98 partition that I was kind of saving for this game, and thought I'd try it anyway. &nbsp;It won't work. &nbsp;Not sure what I'm going to do now... &nbsp;<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I think I'm going to have to take my underwear outside and hose them out. Not only do the graphics look amazing, the atmosphere set by the lighting, sounds and level design make Doom3 the worst thing to spent your night relaxing to. I'm about 20 minutes into the game and I'm already shaken up. The monsters pop out of nowhere leaving you paranoid and scared. It's got to be the most immersive game since System Shock 2 or Half-Life.<br /><br />Highly recommended to anyone who's been wanting a FPS but just hasn't found one that lived up to the good ol' days.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You know, I'm only able to play it at 20 or 30 minute intervals. It's just too intense to play longer than that.<br /><br />Edit 1:<br /><br />I found this thread (http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1167191) over at somethingawful.com yesterday. There is a lot of good discussion about Doom3 and a ton of tweaks people have found. I have yet to play around with any of them, but hope to soon. Be careful though, there are a lot of spoilers and not everyone is using the spoiler tags.<br /><br />By the way, there will be a large section at the top of the thread telling you need to register, but you can ignore it and scroll down to the actual content. You only need to register if you want to be able to post. I do have to say, I love that site and have tons of fun posting there. So far, I've invested $20 in them for my logon and my custom title, which is the equivalent to our avatars here.<br /><br />Edit 2:<br /><br />I posted some screenshots. These are just some examples. By the way, these are very graphic.<br /><br />http://members.cox.net/dgivens4/jaw.png (http://members.cox.net/dgivens4/jaw.png)<br /><br />http://members.cox.net/dgivens4/ceiling.png (http://members.cox.net/dgivens4/ceiling.png)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I got a message from tux games about it:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote"><br />Dear Tux Games customer.<br /><br />As you have pre-ordered Doom 3 from us<br />we are writing to update you on its progress and to ask you<br />to confirm information to us.<br /><br />Doom 3 was released in North America earlier this week. Our<br />stock comes from the UK and the UK release is due in the next<br />few days.<br /><br />Currently, there is NO Linux client. It was not included in<br />the retail box, and will be made available later.<br /><br />As we are a Linux game company, we plan to hold off on<br />shipping until we are able to include a full Linux installer.<br /><br />However we are aware that some of you may wish to receive<br />your copies earlier, and so we will ship copies without the<br />Linux installer to anyone that requests it. Simply reply to<br />this email and let us know you would like us to ship as soon<br />as the game is released<br /><br />Additionally, we now know that there will be two versions of<br />the game, one on CD, one &nbsp;on DVD. We are by default assigning<br />all preorders to be the CD version as that will be the safer<br />option. If you would like to have your order swapped to the<br />DVD version, please just reply to this email and let us know.<br /><br />Finally, if you have changed address in the time since your<br />preorder, please let us know where to ship the game to.<br /><br />Thanks<br />--<br />Tux Games Sales<br /><br /></div><br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">All right, I couldn't stand it any more. &nbsp;That box sitting there staring at me finally broke me down. &nbsp;Installed XPee on a spare hard drive, and fired this thing up.<br /><br />All I can say is that I agree with Rugmonster about the underwear thing. &nbsp;OMG! &nbsp;It has scared me several times, and has (no kidding) made shivers run down the spine more than once.<br /><br />I'm not too far along (in the Alpha-3 Labs being overrun by spiders...), but I am very impressed. &nbsp;I'm not running the video specs on maximum, as it gets a little choppy on my system (running &quot;Medium&quot; setting), but it looks absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />If you've got the horsepower (and the nerves) to run this game, go get it NOW!<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I finally finished Doom3 tonight... &nbsp;I hadn't been playing it in quite a while, and resumed it last week. &nbsp;All I can say is: &nbsp;WOW. &nbsp;<br /><br />My thoughts on the game:<br />The first 20% was very good, fresh, new, scary.<br />The next 30% got quite repetitive and predictable, and caused me to stop playing for several months, as I just kinda lost interest.<br />The last 50% (and especially the final 20%) was absolutely fantastic. &nbsp;I jumped out of my seat many times, and there were some puzzles to be solved... &nbsp;The &quot;Hell&quot; level was truly amazing. &nbsp;There were some cutaway &quot;movie clips&quot; at key times, which are just really great. &nbsp;At the final boss part I wasn't sure I could even do it, but it actually only took me 5 tries... &nbsp;hehe<br /><br />To summarize, the game starts well, gets somewhat boring in the middle, and then finishes in a MOST EXCELLENT fashion. &nbsp;I'd give it a 9 out of 10 on the overall scale, and highly recommend it. &nbsp;Now, on to Half Life 2...<br /><br />Dan</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You know I still don't understand why this game was &quot;left behind&quot; really. &nbsp;I mean, people even said that HL2 looked better than Doom 3...which after seeing both I find laughable. &nbsp;HL2 may look good, but I think even Ninja Gaiden for XBox looks better. &nbsp;Doom 3 has a very &quot;organic&quot; feel to it, a sense of realism even in the event of the surreal. &nbsp;When you tear off a zombie's head it really looks like what your darkest dreams/nightmares would make it look like.<br /><br />The teleporter effect is still one of my all-time favorites, really makes you creep out the first time you see it.<br /><br /><br /><br />You'd probably have to use Cedega in order to play it in Linux but be sure to try out <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Undying</span> if you get the chance. &nbsp;Absolutely AMAZING.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">&lt;shrugs&gt; Eh, it's not for everyone, but I'm just saying I find it hard to believe that in comparing sheer graphic PUNCH that anyone would choose HL2 over Doom 3. &nbsp;HL2's graphics honestly never did anything for me unless we're talking about the facial animations (which WERE superb). &nbsp;Doom 3's could make you scared out of your wits or twist your stomach...but either way managed to really suck you into it.</div>
