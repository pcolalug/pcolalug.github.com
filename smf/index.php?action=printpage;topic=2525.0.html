					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I recently started using Drupal for my personal website. It is pretty nice, but I still feel that I am not using it correctly or maybe that there are better ways to do things. The drupal handbooks seem lacking. Does anyone have any experience with Drupal or know of a good tutorial? Thanks as always.[/url]</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks for offering to help, but it has been a while since I played with Drupal now. I finally ended up using Wordpress for my personal site, though I liked Drupal, I tried Wordpress (http://wordpress.org/) and it worked so I never went back to Drupal to give it another chance. I am thinking of switching my site to a Django (http://www.djangoproject.com/) site now. I got tired of the abomination upon mankind that is php and I also started using postgresql (http://www.postgresql.org/) instead of mysql for my databases and Django is a perfect fit for that. Of course, my site is very simple and I do more web application stuff than I do web design. Anyways, thanks again for offering to help, I appreciate it. </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have a site (http://www.dpeach.com/) using phpWebSite (a Drupal type program) and another (http://www.mythoughtspot.com/) using WordPress. The WordPress site was very easy to configure. I have installed a theme and modified it quite a bit. It is great as a blog. I am not sure how well it works for general content. My phpWebSite site took much more time to set up, but has more flexibility for future expansion I feel.<br /><br />If WordPress works for you, then I would recommend you do that. Super simple.</div>
