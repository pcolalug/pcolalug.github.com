					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Computers Unlimited on Nine Mile has been interviewing. One of their in-house techs is moving to Orlando.<br /><br />Considering that you worked for nptechgroup, not sure if you'll get $13-15/hour though. They do pay depending on exp, and have a group health insurance plan. There are actually 3 locations, Pensacola, Daphne, AL, and Mobile, AL.<br /><br />www.cupensacola.com is the Pensacola office website. www.cupcs.com is the main site.<br /><br />Other than that, there is always Best Software, Mediacom, and I see that Network Telephone is hiring like mad.. Prob closest thing to your experience/administrative operations tasks would be the Network Provisioning gig to start? They also have field installation gigs as well.<br /><br />Regards,</div>
