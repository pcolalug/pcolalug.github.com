					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Dan,<br /><br />When I first started going to LUG meetings I just wanted to see what it was about. I was starting to get into linux and was interested in meeting with people who had simliar interests. The meetings I went to were ok I guess. It wasn&#039;t until I saw you at one of the meetings, and hearing you talk did I realize that no, they were not ok. <br /><br />I heard you talk about how the meetings used to be in the so called &quot;golden years.&quot; You are right, organization was non existant, there was no structure to the meetings, nothing fun was occuring, when you spoke everything you said was on the money. Not only did you know what you were talking about when it came to the structure of an &quot;organization&quot; like the LUG, you also seemed to know linux best. You would post articles and information on the Forums that was interesting and informative, I particularly liked the one about slackware actually teaches an individual how to use linux, rather than just learning a user friendly distro like ubuntu or opensuse. Then there was the horrible attempt at &quot;organizing&quot; a LAN party. After NOTTHING occured, you mentioned you knew why nothing did, but did not say why. I also know why, because nobody took the reigns and said, this is what is happening. Instead you had people including the VP say, hey what is happening with this? Nobody made the call, it was just a horribly display in the leadership being lazy and waiting for someone else to do it, they didn&#039;t even see if the room it would be conducted in was free, just a pic saying it was being used and a sad face. No one seemed to care about the meetings, show up, organize or plan, it was just failure after to failure everytime I went.<br /><br />It was at this time I realized Dan, you were right about everything with the LUG, nobody cared, and thats when I decided, I didn&#039;t care anymore. If the leadership of the organization I just started in couldn&#039;t get up and do something, I didn&#039;t want to be apart of it. Thats when I stopped going to meetings, barely posted on the forums, because what was the point. And if they are going to ban you, the ONE guy I saw as someone who truly cared about what the LUG was and could be, then this is not the organization for me. Say what you want about me, but I came in as an outsider and saw things for what they were, I was hoping things would change and get better, then maybe I would start going to meetings again, but I don&#039;t care. Dan was the one guy I saw that knew how to make things better, and you ban him, ban me, I don&#039;t care.<br /><br />thedood<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">thedood,<br /><br />For starters, we haven&#039;t banned Dan because he is, as you say, &quot;the ONE guy I saw as someone who truly cared about what the LUG was and could be.&quot;&nbsp; We&#039;ve banned him because he violated our by-laws.&nbsp; Posting an ASCII representation of a man bending over and spreading his anus is just not proper behaviour for these forums.&nbsp; Secondly, Dan isn&#039;t the only one who cares about the LUG, if nobody cared, this website wouldn&#039;t be here, we wouldn&#039;t have any officers, it all would have gone years ago!&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying this is a one-man-show to keep going, and I&#039;m surely not suggesting that I&#039;m that man.&nbsp; There are about 7 people that I know of who actually regularly or semi-regularly participate in one way or another.&nbsp; Yes, we are not currently in any &quot;golden years&quot; period by any stretch of the imagination, we need people who want to show up to meetings, to give us things to learn about at those meetings, the few of us who have been active for years are burnt out!&nbsp; We&#039;ve grown weary of coming up with all the ideas, trying to see them through to completion, we have lives, work, families.&nbsp; If the group as a whole doesn&#039;t show interest in the efforts of other members, then those members don&#039;t feel like doing more, that&#039;s where this apathy is stemming from.<br /><br />This discussion is all hyperbole to the topic at hand, anyway, we&#039;re merely wondering if the group as a whole thinks that Dan should be given another chance to either participate and help us recover, or, if he desires, antagonize us all until the end.<br /><br />Ian</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Ian,<br /><br />are you ******* retarded? I never said anything about why you are kicking him out, I was showing that I was upset that it was happening. **** it I&#039;m done, you hear a lot of things about linux users, I guess a lot is true.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />(Edited for language -- green_dragon37)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have been a member of the LUG since March 2003 and during this time I have seen Dan&#039;c&#039;s contributions to the LUG. I admired him for his willingness to help new members overcome the many problems linux presented. If it hadn&#039;t been for him, I think I would have given up using linux years ago. I don&#039;t know the circumstances that were behind the way he has acted the last couple of years, but if he says he is over that then I say he stay in the LUG. I was on the steering committee during some of his most scalding postings and I was not offended because most of what he said was true. As a group we were ineffective as leaders. As a LUG we were apathetic to the highest level. I don&#039;t know how the LUG has lasted this long and if Dan wants to help get the LUG going again, then I say give him a chance------------------------Woodyharold</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Woody If I understand it right Dan is not banned from the lug, just posting on the forum. He is free to contribute to the lug activities. The only thing he has done lately is setup a server for a lan party that didn&#039;t happen because there was no place to have it so he got mad. Everybody had thanked him for his efforts but he didn&#039;t get his way and posted obscene material on the forum that all ages of folks could view as well as people in general that do not like such things.&nbsp; </div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Just an observation... seems folks that are members but not active have decided to take part in this. If all those people would come to the meeting in January we will have a good crowd.&nbsp; :D</div>
