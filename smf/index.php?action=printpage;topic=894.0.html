					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">One of the biggest deterrents in computers is questions. It is funny how one question can lead to a dozen more. I call this the snowball effect. I discovered that I spend hours daily researching for answers. About a month ago, I came across O&#8217;reilly&#8217;s Bookshelves. I thought to myself. Here we go all the answers that I want all wrapped up and discounted. Well little did I know what came in the bookshelves. I started reading and noticed a few examples that I could use. So I popped in the CD so I could to try these examples out and up pop the menu. There it was right below the list of books. In blue bold letters &#8220;Search All Books.&#8221; I thought to myself no way. That would be too easy. Sure enough I could not only search individual books but all of them at once. You don&#8217;t even realize the power and speed that gives you. With the use of the CD Bookshelves, my problem solving time has decreased approximately 75%. I recommend any and all of the O&#8217;reilly CD Bookshelves.</div>
