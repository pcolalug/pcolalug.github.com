					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Has anyone here had experience coding with the various toolkits for X? &nbsp;<br /><br />It's hard to find open-minded discussions and opinions about this online. &nbsp;I'm trying to decide which would be the best to learn.<br /><br />I like Qt because it's cross-platform. &nbsp;But the only tutorial I could come across is the official one on the trolltech site which tells you how to write a little game -- not much real GUI code to look at.<br /><br />I think I want to stay away from KDE programming. &nbsp;I went through a little of the tutorials, and it seemed confusing, some stuff was using Qt functions, other stuff was using KDE functions. &nbsp;I think I would have trouble knowing which lib to use for what.<br /><br />Gtk seems to be cross platform, and very functional. &nbsp;But even the simple programs seem complex (maybe due to the fact that their C versus C++). &nbsp;The Hello World sample program is several pages long, just to get a window and button on-screen.<br /><br />Any opinions / suggestions? &nbsp;Or possible another toolkit not mentioned here?<br /><br />Also, for those of you who program Java. &nbsp;How is the awt? &nbsp;(I think that's what they call their windowing libs). &nbsp;Is it a very complete toolkit for writing real applications?<br /><br />Another alternative I've been considering is using a scripting language with GUI extensions, like PerlGTK or TclTK or something. &nbsp;<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I haven't done anything with GTK(+/-), but you confirm everything I've heard about it being a bit cumbersome. Qt is really clean and pretty easy to work with. Signals and slots are a joy after the nightmare of callbacks. There should be application scripting with this latest release as well. (How long before KDE gets email viruses?)<br /><br />As for java(TM)*, I hate awt/swing. It feels cludgey. I've been looking into XWT (http://www.xwt.org) a bit for a project at work. Seems pretty cool, if you're into the XML-as-gui-markup type of thing.<br /><br />The sad truth of it all is that if you want to stay in the area and code for a living, you probably want to be proficient with Visual Basic and/or Visual C++. Java never hurts, and there is a lot of database (SQL) work to be had if the timing is right. &nbsp;You should also have a sprinkling of web programming in your toolkit as well, for when times get lean. ;)<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, though, these should be condidered &quot;fallback&quot; skills to pay the bills if need be. In addition, *nothing* can substitute for good general programming skills. Just my .0012 escudos.<br /><br /><br />*Java is a registered trademark of Sun Microsystems. Used without permission.</div>
