					Post by: <b>Nomad</b> on <b>September 20, 2005, 05:18:08 am</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">was wondering if anyone knows anything about Going over 253 Computers with DHCP. Maybe a quick cheat sheet online about setup / server routing. I just picked up 14 FSM750S Netgears with 48 port and 2 GB uplink with a GSM7548 as the uplink for my 2 game servers and my Gateway box. <br /><br />My network is setup as the 14 FSM750S are dual piped to the GSM with the managment side running the upper 24 to the first GB port and the lower 24 to the Lower GB port. <br /><br />My question is I know nothing about routing 192.168.1.XXX &lt;-&gt; 192.168.2.XXX.<br /><br />What i was thinking about doing was having my DHCP server running with 2 nics one serving 192.168.1.XXX and the other running the .2.XXX. But i don't know how to link the traffic between the 2 DHCP services...<br /><br />Any Ideas?<br /><br />Nomad</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I'm not sure but wouldn't you just make your dhcp server serve up IP ranges 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.2.255 with netmask 255.255.254.0.<br /><br />Yeah I'm just guessing here... &nbsp;Lloyd might know this stuff though.<br /><br />Nick</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">The question is if you need two subnets of 254 host addresses, or if you want one large subnet with 510 host addresses. If you do as Imnes says and make use of a /25 subnet mask (255.255.254.0) you would be able to use 192.168.1.1 through 192.168.2.254 without dealing with any routing. On a switched network, this wouldn't be so bad and your DHCP configuration would be the same as any &quot;normal&quot;, small network setup.<br /><br />If you decide that you need to segment your network into two smaller chunks and route between the two subnets, then you run into additional issues. DHCP is a broadcast protocol. In order to have DHCP traffic traverse multiple subnets, you would need what's called a DHCP relay agent. A DHCP relay agent listens on a given subnet for DHCP requests and forwards those UDP broadcasts to a specific IP address. If you are running the ISC DHCP Server, you will find the dhcrelay (http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/dhcrelay8.html) command useful.<br /><br />Now, when you say you have the managment side running the upper 24 to the first GB port and the lower 24 to the second GB port, do you mean you have the first 24 ports and first gigabit port on one VLAN and the last 24 ports and gigabit port on another VLAN? If so, you have to realize that VLANs segment your network. You have to have a routing device to get traffic between VLANs. Also, what is the GSM7548 because I couldn't find it on Google.<br /><br />Also, you say they are &quot;dual piped&quot; to the GSM, which I'm assuming is a 48 port gigabit switch. Unless you are using some sort of bonding (Etherchannel on Cisco switches), or each is on a seperate VLAN, one of those ports will be shut down due to Spanning Tree to close off the network loop. <br /><br />Perhaps I'm failing to see what you're trying to do, but you have a lot more ports than just two /24 subnets will handle. In fact, you need three Class C subnets to cover all of your ports. It sounds like you have a whole lot of expensive hardware and don't really know how to make the best use out of it.<br /><br />My suggestion, figure out just how many ports you really need and send the rest of the switches back. If you really need 672 ports, then stack the switches together in groups of three (according to the website, three is the max that can be stacked together) and assign each stack to a seperate VLAN. Use 802.1q trunking between switches and assign your VLANs by port. You would then do an 802.1q trunk to your router. Here (http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7268) is an article regarding setting up VLANs and 802.1q trunking between a Linux router and a Cisco switch. You can then either run a single DHCP server bound to an interface on one VLAN with DHCP relay agents listening and forwarding requests from other VLANs, or run multiple DHCP servers bound to each VLAN.<br /><br />I'm really curious. What the heck do you need all those ports for?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Sorry I ment the 48 Port GB Switch GSM7248. &nbsp;And I have no idea about the vlan thing, but in the managed part of the switch I could assign a GB port to be a traffic relay for the upper 24 ports IE Ports 1-24 use GB Port 1 for relay and ports 25-48 use GB Port 2 for relay IE like having 2 24 ports with 1 GB uplink. &nbsp;My main goal is to be able to to have around 615 Computers on a non segmented network. 192.168.1.5 would be able to ping 192.168.3.150 with no issues. &nbsp;Lets say that computer on the 192.168.1.5 is COMP1 and the computer on 192.168.3.150 is COMP2: so on COMP1 i could type \\COMP2 and bring up the share files... and vice versa.<br /><br />And your right it is about 10 grand in hardware that I might be getting, right now i have a friend with 3 of the 48 10/100's and a 4 port GB. &nbsp;I'm assuming that i would atleast need level 2 managed for this project. &nbsp;I'm talking about some serious data transfer.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I think you're misunderstanding what &quot;layer 2 managed stackable switch means&quot;. Layer 2 is refering to the OSI model (http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/cisintwk/ito_doc/introint.htm). Basically, all switching is done on Layer 2. When you see a Layer 3 switch (or multilayer switch), it can do IP routing as well as normal switching based on MAC address. Layer 3 switches can do most of the same jobs routers can do, only faster. These are typically used as the core for a large internal LAN. Routers are typically used as the gateways to WAN connections. <br /><br />Managed means that you can configure the switch to do different things. Most of your home and home office switches are unmanaged. Managed switches give you more flexibility by bringing in the option of VLANs, SNMP monitoring, Channel Bonding and more advanced monitoring and performance options. For a network the size you are talking about, I would definitely say you need managed switches.<br /><br />Stackable switches allow you to scale the size of your switch. Basically, by &quot;stacking&quot; or linking the backbone of the switch with another one, you effectively increase the number of ports and manage them as one device. Also, that backbone connection is much larger than what you would have if you were using a cross-over cable on one of the normal 10/100/1000 ports. If you have a need for this, such as in a data closet with 96 or 144 drops terminating, you can use this.<br /><br />You talked about dedicating half of the ports on each switch to one gigabit port and the other half to the other. I see a problem with this. The idea sounds great and all, but what happens when the top gigabit port is being maxed out and the bottom gigabit port isn't being used at all. I suggest you look in to channel bonding. What this would do is use the bandwidth of both ports together as one virtual connection. Also, should one of those ports go down (cable cut, short burn out the port, etc) you still have full connectivity for all 48 ports.<br /><br />Finally, we spoke last night on AIM and you said that they were going to be using a T3 for their internet connection. Do you have a router with a serial port to support that connection? What about a CSU/DSU? Also, are you going to have contract maintenance on all of this equipment after it is all purchased? Hardware this expensive, in my opinion, shouldn't go on warantee alone. In an apartment complex, if people are depending on you for their internet, they aren't going to quietly wait a week for you to order a new switch and have it shipped in. With a maintenance plan, most times, the company will have a new switch out to you in an hour, setup and working. Do you plan to keep spares around? It's tempting to go cheap, but I think a project this large should really be contracted out to someone who has experience in setting up a network like this. Either that or you need to do some serious reading. Once I get to work, I'll post some recommended readings.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Okay, here is my list of recommended readings. I suggest reading these in order and not getting bogged down into the details, especially when it comes to Cisco proprietary stuff since you aren't using Cisco switches. Most of the content of these books is more concepts and ideas of switching, routing and IP based internetworks. So here it goes:<br /><br />CCNA Self-Study: Introduction to Cisco Networking Technologies (INTRO) 640-821, 640-801 (http://www.ciscopress.com/title/1587051613)<br />This book mainly covers the fundamental topics of networking. I love this book because it doesn't go into too much history or irrelevent technology, but gives you a great foundation to build upon.<br /><br />CCNA Self-Study: Interconnecting Cisco Network Devices (ICND) 640-811, 640-801, 2nd Edition (http://www.ciscopress.com/title/1587051427)<br />This is another great one. While there is more Cisco specific information in this book, the concepts are what are so important. You will get an overview of how and why Ethernet switching works, an overview of WAN technologies and an introduction to IP routing and routing protocols.<br /><br />CCDA Self-Study: Designing for Cisco Internetwork Solutions (DESGN) 640-861 (http://www.ciscopress.com/title/1587051419)<br />I wouldn't consider this book an absolute necessity, but I would encourage it since you are designing a rather large network. Before you buy the equipment, I would at least look through this book and the one that follows.<br /><br />CCNP Self-Study: Building Cisco Multilayer Switched Networks (BCMSN), 3rd Edition (http://www.ciscopress.com/title/1587052199)<br />For the love of god, please read the first book and this one. For the sake of the future users and anyone who might work on that network, please read and understand the concepts in them.<br /><br />CCNP Self-Study: Building Scalable Cisco Internetworks (BSCI), 2nd Edition (http://www.ciscopress.com/title/158705146X)<br />If you do wind up with a frame-relay &quot;T3&quot; or an actual T3, I suggest you read this book. You may be able to get by with the information from the ICND book, but this book will go into much more detail on routing. You may find it invaluable.<br /><br />So, that's a lot of reading. You have to understand that in order for a network the size you are talking about to work efficiently, there is a lot more than plugging in cross over cables between switches and telling your DHCP server to give out IPs. You are going to be setting up what could easily be referred to as a Campus Area Network. So, read up or find a good consultant to handle the job for you.<br /><br />Lastly, Netgear isn't exactly known for their enterprise level managed devices. Cisco is kind of the industry standard when it comes to internetworks. They have outstanding service and support and the conditions I've seen their equipment work in is simply amazing. You will have an easier time finding people to work on the equipment should something break and more people will be able to help you out on the intarweb, should you need it. Did I mention getting a support contract? Don't ever ever <b>ever</b> run a network that large without a support contract on your equipment.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks alot for the reading... So far I'm about a 1/3 of the way thru the Intro Exam Guild for the CCNA learning more then i ever knew about networking! &nbsp;And your right I had no idea what i was getting in to but I am a quick learner and have decided that if I don't have my CCNA Intro and INCD that i will hand the job over to someone more qualified.<br /><br />Thanks again!</div>
