					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Anybody use GO mail? &nbsp;(mail.go.com). &nbsp;It's a popular free web mail service that has been around a long time. &nbsp;I've been using it since high school, so you can imagine why I'm not in a hurry to change email addresses.<br /><br />On July 7th, this message showed up on the login page...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote"><br />We would like to inform you that we are expanding and upgrading our e-mail systems to ensure a more reliable e-mail experience. Many of the changes we are implementing are in response to your suggestions in recent customer surveys. Specifically, you can expect to see the following:<br />&nbsp;<br />1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PROMPT DELIVERY AND RECEIPT OF E-MAILS - We are focused on ensuring the prompt receipt and delivery of e-mails. This has been achieved in large part already, and will get even better.<br />&nbsp;<br />2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EXPANDED MAIL BOX STORAGE CAPACITY - We will be increasing the amount of free mailbox storage you are allocated by 50%, from 4 MB to 6 MB, which is more storage than is available from most free services in the market today. This new experience will be rolled out to all users by August.<br />&nbsp;<br />3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPAM REDUCTION - We will continue to focus on spam reduction. This will include adding programs to block spam from our system, and focusing on the elimination of abusers of our spam policies.<br />&nbsp;<br />4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ATTACHMENTS - We have eliminated a problem which was preventing certain attachments from being accepted.<br />&nbsp;<br />© Disney. All Rights Reserved.<br /></div><br /><br />Cool. &nbsp;4mb was feeling kinda cramped. &nbsp;And all the spam was annoying. &nbsp;But here's the catch. &nbsp;I think they broke something, or their spam filter is misconfigured. &nbsp;Because once the upgrade happened, 100% of incoming mail stopped arriving. &nbsp;Messages don't bounce or get an error, they just never make it to my inbox. &nbsp;Now recently, I've been getting 60-80 messages a day (counting all the spam). &nbsp;I haven't received a single message in going on 5 days now :(<br /><br />This is really an annoying situation, I have correspondence going with people from eBay transactions, school projects, etc. &nbsp;And I can't get my mail. &nbsp;What's worse - I imagine that tech support address is something like (support@go.com). &nbsp;Well, I guess that would mean I can send messages to them all day long to tell them it's broke and they'll never receive them.<br /><br />Right now I'm just waiting it out, &nbsp;not much more I can do. &nbsp;I emailed support lines at every parent company listed on their page: Disney, DisneyOnline, ABCNews, ESPN, FamilyFun, ABC.com, Movies.com - some bounced but some went through so hopefully they're getting it all straightened out!<br /><br />Just one more reason to get my own mail server working...</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">This is the perfect example why i decided to lease a server. &nbsp;One so that i can always have the same email address, and two cause hotmail got bought by microsoft. &nbsp;i used hotmail from 94 to 96ish when it was on an e10k (which the backend still is i believe), then i tried yahoo. ugh that was painful, so then i dropped the dough for it. &nbsp;it is worth it if you can configure everything yourself or have a decent admin that does it.<br /><br /><br />/lance</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">on completely other subject, i am trying to get slackware installed on my laptop. &nbsp;being a PITA actually, let me rephrase, it's not that big of a deal to get it installed, but i haven't tried installing slackware since version 4.0 in 96ish . &nbsp;I noticed the installer isn't quit the same, is there antyhing ishould know, once i tireld to tell it to load lilo it basically said it did and then when i rebooted it it would atempt to load the kernel image and panic saying something about &nbsp;auto:auto not found kernel panic.<br /><br /><br />go finger, the good thing is redhat installs just fine, so it must be something i am doing or a difference in the boot loader (i don't use grub that much) configurations.</div>
