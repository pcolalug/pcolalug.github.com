					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I thought you all might like to know that I was recently asked to put together a document for a company in the area that is considering moving more towards Linux. Currently we use Linux in several areas such as web servers, IDS servers, and a few appliance/embedded devices. The VP of Tech has asked the security team to make a case for Linux in other areas.<br /><br />My goal is to eventually have a mix of operating systems in the environment where each works the best.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Alt, in the long run (w. respect to SCOX lawsuits) what do you think the long term effect on the expansion of Linux in the enterprise will be? &nbsp;Does SCOX lawsuits have any merit w. respect to ownership of the sourcecode? They've been hitting up actual corporate endusers apparently?<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />ms</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">-&gt;The VP of Tech has asked the security team to make a case for Linux in other areas. <br /><br />The VP of Tech needs to get a clue. &nbsp;When it comes to security, the operating system itself bears very little impact. &nbsp;What is more important is how the operating system is configured/updated/used. &nbsp;I have been in the security business for a while and have seen Windows systems that were severely locked down, and Linux boxes that were swiss cheese. &nbsp;One of the exceptions to this is OpenBSD which is relatively secure by default. &nbsp;<br /><br />My main point is this: &nbsp;the operating system choice in and of itself &#8220;usually&#8221; has little bearing on the security. &nbsp;A case can be made for anything by anyone, what the VP of Tech should have asked was this:<br /><br />&#8220;Let&#8217;s review our current infrastructure and make sure that we are using the best tools for the job.&#8221;<br /><br />Just my $.02<br /><br />Kyle</div>

One large factor in security is not just the security of an OS but the skill set of the people working with it. If you employ all MCSE windows administrators and then put them on a nix os, chances are you will have alot of problems. We had to eval where we could put linux and ensure the admins could handle the responsiblity.</div>
