					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I wanted my 1,000th post to be something more than just a number, so I decided to introduce myself.<br /><br />I have been with the P'cola LUG since the second meeting. The first meeting, as I understand it, was at Rodney's house. Most of you have never met Rodney, but he and bhoff and maybe one other person got together in December of either 2000 or 2001 (I cannot remember now) to talk about a LUG. I had been looking for one since I moved from Nashville where we had a pretty active LUG.<br /><br />I had gotten Rodney's email address from a website that was being used to help get people together to form LUGs. I wrote him the night that they had that first meeting! Had I been a few hours earlier, I might have been in on the ground floor. I came to the January meeting, which was held on Thursdays back then.<br /><br />We had our first elections for officers in September of 2002. I was elected Vice-President. I cannot remember if we were a group for a year and 1/2 before we had elections, or just that first year. That is why I cannot remember if we were put together in 2000 or 2001. Maybe bhoff or Steve or Newton or erc or rburt or someone else from the early days can remember.<br /><br />My interest in Linux is for personal enjoyment. My job as a missionary does not require me to be a programmer, so I have no real interest that direction. I mainly use the computer for word processing, web browsing, e-mail, games and limited art and publication type work. I have run a web server and mail server to serve up my own domain. But since moving away from DSL with a static IP, I am now being professionally hosted. I also use Linux for some router work in my network as well as one of my computers is a dedicated Linux PVR (http://www.mythtv.org).</div>
