					Title: <b>Significance of Assembly</b><br />

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">After reading this (http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/04/02/05/228200.shtml?tid=126&amp;tid=146&amp;tid=156&amp;tid=99) article on /., I began to wonder what the opinions of our fellow CompSci majors and graduates are on the significance of assembly and the suggestion that the definitive mark of a great programmer is his/her knowledge of assembly since he/she is required to know the inner workings of the computer. Since I am new to the world of programming, I'm curious to see your opinions.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, I still feel like a &quot;hack&quot; because I started w. BASIC, vs. listening to my friend on the school bus telling me that I had to learn assembler at the machine level, in order to have a solid baseline understanding. &nbsp;I think I was 11 or 12 at the time.. I'm finally going to hunker down this year and get a grip on all this stuff I'd been using, administering, creating and selling the past 13 years. :)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Depends on what kind of programs you're writing. &nbsp;If you're working on something where you need optimal performace, then knowing ASM is nice. &nbsp;Even if you're coding in C or Pascal or Fortran, it gives you a better understanding of how you can write your code so that the compiler can optimize it better. &nbsp;You'll learn about memory management, you'll learn about the stack and heap. &nbsp;If you're writing business apps in delphi I guess that doesn't really help you. &nbsp;Knowing ASM is kind of useless, but all the in-depth knowledge that you get along with it is good I guess.</div>
