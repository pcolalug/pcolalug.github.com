					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">http://www.fon.com/1yearold/<br /><br />Share a wireless connection with the public and get a free router. These cool little routers are designed by Cisco/Linksys, and come already flashed and running ddwrt! Plus they allow a dual SSID (public and private), so all you wifi hacks should like that. If you have a business, it&#039;s a good way to get a little publicity. There are several places are NWFL already with these hanging out.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m fairly certain it&#039;s going to be against the TOS of most any commercial ISP.<br /><br />I personally don&#039;t see it as any different than putting up a wireless ap that isn&#039;t controlled. Everyone can still connect to it and go. With this, they can connect, but you limit how much bandwidth they can use and they are separated from your network. It&#039;s sort of like the whole &quot;no servers&quot; clause in most every cable companies TOS. Yeah, it&#039;s there and no they would rather you not do it, but rarely is it enforced. The likelihood of them figuring it out is so low, I&#039;m not even going to worry about it with my ISP. I hate them as it is, so it won&#039;t make me cry if they drop my service.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here in Pensacola, yes they do care. I had my service cut off within 48 hours of putting a test web server online. That prompted upgrading to the commercial service, which at the time was only $20 more a month. Fortunately I&#039;m locked into as long as I keep the service.&nbsp; :P<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Web Server yes and there is ways around that I run mine over encrypted channel.<br />But wireless AP they do not have time to mess with, Because all it shows is a public unencrypted AP.<br />There is 12 others in my area that I assure you are not intentional. Mine has only had two hits for less than<br />10 minutes each since it was put up.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">It really all depends on who you have. I know Cox was cracking down for a while, but I never had any problems from them the entire time I lived in OKC. My current ISP, Knology, states they do not allow servers on residential service, but I have yet to have any problems in the two years I&#039;ve been here. I heard Roadrunner was bad for a while, but recently slacked up. If you want to take the chance, then that&#039;s on you. I say it&#039;s a pretty safe bet that sharing wireless is going to get noticed.</div>
